Our Company

&#160;

PhotoMedex, Inc., re-incorporated in Nevada on December 30, 2010, originally formed in Delaware in 1980, is a Global Health products and services company providing integrated disease management and aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians and consumers. We provide proprietary products and services that address skin diseases and conditions including acne and photo damage. Our experience in the physician market provides the platform to expand our skin health solutions to spa markets, as well as traditional retail, online and infomercial outlets for home-use products. Through our subsidiary Radiancy, Inc., which was merged into PhotoMedex in 2011, we&#8217;ve added a range of home-use devices under the no!no!&#174; brand, for various indications including hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation, and lower back pain. In addition, our professional product line increased its offerings for acne clearance, skin tightening, psoriasis care and hair removal sold to physician clinics and spas.

&#160;

Acquisitions and Dispositions (dollar amounts in thousands except where indicated and for per-share amounts) On May 12, 2014, PhotoMedex, Inc. acquired 100% of the shares of LCA-Vision Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;LCA-Vision&#8221; or &#8220;LCA&#8221;). LCA is a provider of fixed-site laser vision corrections services at its LasikPlus&#174; vision centers. The results of operations of LCA-Vision have been included from May 13, 2014 through January 31, 2015 into the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation . ). 

&#160;

On January 31, 2015, the Company sold 100% of the shares of LCA-Vision Inc. for $40 million in cash. Excluding working capital adjustments and professional fees, the Company realized net proceeds of approximately $37.7 million, substantially all of which were used to repay indebtedness. The LCA-Vision assets and liabilities were considered to be held for sale as of December 31, 2014. For the statement of comprehensive loss, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the activity related to LCA&#8217;s operations through the date of disposition, and any gains or losses therefrom, are captured as discontinued operations. (See Note 2, Discontinued Operations .) 

&#160;

Also, the Company amended its stock purchase Agreement with Vision to permit an Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10) or 336(e) election under which all parties to the transaction, including the Company, are treated for tax purposes as if Vision had purchased the assets of LCA rather than LCA&#8217;s stock. Vision agreed to pay the Company the sum of $300 for entry into the First Amendment.

&#160;

Concurrent with the LCA-Vision Inc. acquisition, on May 12, 2014, PhotoMedex entered into an $85 million senior secured credit facilities (the &#8220;Facilities&#8221;) with JP Morgan Chase (&#8220;Chase&#8221;) which included a $10 million revolving credit facility and a $75 million four-year term loan. The facilities were utilized to refinance the existing term debt with Chase, fund the acquisition of LCA and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest was determined at Eurodollar plus a margin between 3.25% and 4.50%. The margin was updated quarterly based on the then-current leverage ratio. The facilities were secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on all assets of the Company. All current and future subsidiaries were guarantors on the Facilities.

&#160;

There were financial covenants including a maximum leverage covenant and a minimum fixed charge covenant, which the Company must maintain. These covenants were determined quarterly based on a rolling past four quarters of financial data. As of June 30, 2014, the Company failed to meet the financial covenants and, as of December 31, 2014, the Company continued to fail to meet these covenants and remained in default. On August 4, 2014, the Company received a notice of default and a reservation of rights from Chase and engaged a third-party independent advisor to assist the Company in negotiating a longer term solution to the defaults. The parties entered into a series of Forbearance Agreements regarding this debt, which was later paid off in its entirety on June 23, 2015, following the sale of the XTRAC business to MELA Sciences Inc. (&#8216;MELA Sciences&#8221;). (See Note 2, Discontinued Operations .) 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 3, 2014, PhotoMedex&#8217; wholly-owned subsidiary, Radiancy, Inc., formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong, Radiancy (HK) Limited, through which we have started to directly market certain products and services to patients and consumers in selected markets in that region.

&#160;

On March 5, 2014, PhotoMedex formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, PhotoMedex India Private Limited, through which we planned to directly market certain products and services to patients and consumers in selected markets in that country. On June 22, 2015, this subsidiary was sold to MELA Sciences. On August 18, 2014, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Korea, PhotoMedex Korea Limited, through which we planned to directly market certain products and services to patients and consumers in selected markets in that country. This subsidiary has subsequently been closed as a result of the sale of this division to MELA Sciences on June 22, 2015.

&#160;

XTRAC is an excimer laser technology for skin disorders. It received an FDA clearance in 2000 and has since become a widely recognized treatment among dermatologists for psoriasis and other skin diseases. The XTRAC brand lasers deliver ultra narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) light to affected areas of the skin in order to treat an array of skin conditions, including psoriasis and vitiligo, which combined affect up to 10.5 million people in the U.S. and 190 million people worldwide. The XTRAC products are sold to physicians primarily overseas, while in the US under a recurring revenue model, we generated incremental income on a per-use basis from these machines.

&#160;

Effective June 22, 2015, PhotoMedex, Inc. and its subsidiary PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. (&#34;PTECH&#34;), entered into an asset purchase agreement with MELA Sciences. Under the asset purchase agreement, MELA Sciences acquired the XTRAC&#174; excimer laser business and the VTRAC&#174; excimer lamp business from PTECH, certain international intellectual property rights held by Photo Therapeutics Ltd., the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom, and the stock of PhotoMedex India Private Limited, the Company's subsidiary in India, for a total purchase price of $42.5 million in cash. $750 of the proceeds from the sale (the &#8220;Escrow Agreement&#8221;) were being placed in an escrow, as described below. The Company used a portion of the non-escrowed proceeds to repay indebtedness under the Chase Credit Agreement, and the remaining portion of the non-escrowed proceeds to pay fees in connection with the transaction.

&#160;

Under the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Amount has been placed into an escrow account held by U.S. Bank National Association as Escrow Agent. The funds shall remain in escrow for one year following the closing of the transaction. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the Escrow Amount may be increased in the event of additional transactions involving the Company, its subsidiaries and/or their assets.

&#160;

The Company also engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of surgical products, including proprietary free-beam and Contact Laser&#8482; Systems for surgery. We marketed Contact Laser surgery by combining proprietary Contact Laser Delivery Systems with a LaserPro&#174; Diode laser system to create a multi-specialty surgical instrument that can cut, coagulate or vaporize tissue. We were marketing such products under the trade name PhotoMedex Surgical Products.

&#160;

Effective September 1, 2015, PhotoMedex, Inc. and its subsidiary, PTECH, entered into an asset purchase agreement and a supplemental agreement (together, the &#8220;SLT Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with DaLian JiKang Medical Systems Import &#38; Export Co., LTD, (&#8220;JIKANG&#8221;). Under the SLT Asset Purchase Agreement, JIKANG acquired the SLT&#174; surgical laser business (the &#8220;Transferred Business&#8221;) from PTECH, for a total purchase price of $1.5 million (the &#8220;Purchase Price&#8221;). The Company will net approximately $1.2 million after payment of closing and ancillary costs.

&#160;

The Purchase Price is payable to the Company in three installments. An initial deposit of $300 was made on September 2, 2015. Additionally, JIKANG provided two letters of credit to the Company for the remainder of the Purchase Price. The $1 million letter of credit was collected on December 3, 2015, at which time substantially all the assets were transferred to JIKANG in consummation of the transaction. The remaining letter of credit for $200 will be payable to the Company, after certain post-closing steps including the receipt of all assets at JIKANG&#8217;s facilities and the training of JIKANG&#8217;s personnel.

&#160;

The SLT Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of the Company, PTECH and JIKANG, as well customary indemnification provisions among the parties.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On January 6, 2016, PhotoMedex, Inc. received an advance of $4 million, less a $40 financing fee (the &#8220;January 2016 Advance&#8221;), from CC Funding, a division of Credit Cash NJ, LLC, (the &#34;Lender&#34;), pursuant to a Credit Card Receivables Advance Agreement (the &#34;Advance Agreement&#34;), dated December 21, 2015. The Company&#8217;s domestic subsidiaries, Radiancy, Inc.; PTECH.; and Lumiere, Inc., are also parties to the Advance Agreement (collectively with the Company, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;).

&#160; 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Advance Agreement, the Lender will make periodic advances to the Company (collectively with the January 2016 Advance, the &#8220;Advances&#8221;). The proceeds of the Advances may be used to conduct the ordinary business of the Company only.

&#160;

All outstanding Advances will be repaid through the Borrowers&#8217; existing and future credit card receivables and other rights to payment arising out of the Borrowers&#8217; acceptance or other use of any credit or charge card (collectively, &#8220;Credit Card Receivables&#8221;) generated by activities based in the United States. The Company&#8217;s processor for those Credit Card Receivables (the &#8220;Processor&#8221;) has been instructed to remit, via electronic funds transfer, to the Lender all of the Borrowers&#8217; Credit Card Receivables collected by the Processor (net of any discounts, fees and/or similar amounts legally owed to the Processor by the Borrowers and any charge-backs, offsets and/or other amounts which the Processor is entitled to deduct from the proceeds) until the Lender gives written notice that all Advances then outstanding and associated fees and expenses have been received by Lender.

&#160; 

Each Advance is to be secured by a security interest in favor of the Lender in certain defined Collateral, including but not limited to all of the Borrowers&#8217; Credit Card Receivables; inventory, merchandise and materials; equipment, machinery, furniture, furnishings and fixtures; patents, trademarks and tradenames; and all other intangibles and payment rights arising out of the provision of goods or services by the Borrowers.

&#160;

In the event of a sale by the Company of certain collateralized assets, repayment of $1.5 million of the outstanding principal balance is required to be accelerated or in the event of the sale of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets, the remaining outstanding principal balance is required to be repaid.

&#160;

PENDING TRANSACTION 

&#160;

On February 19, 2016, PhotoMedex, Inc., Radiancy, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Radiancy&#8221;), DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (&#8220;DSKX&#8221;) and PHMD Consumer Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSKX (&#8220;Merger Sub A&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Radiancy Merger Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Radiancy will merge with Merger Sub A, with Radiancy as the surviving corporation in such merger (the &#8220;Radiancy Merger&#8221;). Concurrently, PHMD, PTECH, DSKX, and PHMD Professional Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSKX (&#8220;Merger Sub B&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;P-Tech Merger Agreement&#8221; and together with the Radiancy Merger Agreement, the &#8220;Merger Agreements&#8221;) pursuant to which PTECH will merge with Merger Sub B, with PTECH as the surviving corporation in such merger (the &#8220;P-Tech Merger&#8221; and together with the Radiancy Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). As a result of the Mergers, DSKX will become the holding company for Radiancy and PTECH. The Mergers are expected to qualify as tax-free transfers of property to DSKX for federal income tax purposes. There can be no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreements will be consummated as both the Company and DSKX must seek approval by its shareholders prior to consummating the transactions.

&#160;

The Radiancy Merger Agreement provides that, upon completion of the Radiancy Merger, the Company shall receive 2.0 million shares of preferred stock to be issued by DSKX (the &#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) and a note with a principal amount of up to $4.5 million with an interest rate of 3% per annum (the &#8220;Note&#8221;). Pursuant to the Note, DSKX will pay the Company $1.5 million on the closing date, $2.0 million plus accrued interest on September 15, 2016 and the balance plus accrued interest on the third anniversary of the date of issuance. The Note will be secured by a pledge of all of Radiancy&#8217;s capital stock and a security interest in its collateral. The Series A Preferred Stock, when issued, will have a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and vote on an &#8220;as converted&#8221; basis, together with the holders of DSXK&#8217;s common stock as a single class on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of DSKX&#8217;s common stock, with a separate class vote with respect to (a) any amendment, alteration, waiver or repeal of DSKX&#8217;s articles of incorporation or bylaws and (b) creation, authorization or issuance of any other series of preferred stock or capital stock by DSKX having a liquidation preference superior to the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock does not accrue or pay any dividend. No earlier than five years following issuance, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are subject to a mandatory redemption by DSKX at the option of the holder, at a price of $10.00 per share. Beginning on the first anniversary of issuance, shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into five shares of DSKX common stock, subject to adjustments contained therein. DSKX can force mandatory conversions following each of the first three anniversary dates of issuance based upon the 20-day volume weighted average price (&#8220;VWAP&#8221;) of closing share prices of DSKX common stock exceeding certain agreed upon thresholds on those dates. If the combined adjusted working capital of Radiancy and PTECH is less than $11.5 million, there is a dollar-for-dollar adjustment to the Note first impacting the installment due on the third anniversary of the issuance date, and second to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be issued, at a rate of $10.00 per share.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The P-Tech Merger Agreement provides that, upon completion of the P-Tech Merger, the Company shall receive 8.75 million shares of DSKX common stock, of which 6.0 million are subject to a make-whole adjustment. If those 6.0 million shares of DSKX common stock are not worth $20.0 million based upon a 30-day VWAP of closing share prices of DSKX common stock ending on the first anniversary of the closing date, DSKX shall issue an additional number of shares of DSKX common stock, valued at that 30-day VWAP, so that the value of the Company&#8217;s initial 6.0 million shares, together with the additional shares received, is worth $20.0 million. This make-whole adjustment will not apply if the Company has received $50.0 million of aggregate net cash proceeds from the merger consideration paid under both Merger Agreements or if the Company has rejected a bona fide offer from DSKX of $50.0 million in cash for such merger consideration. The number of shares of DSKX common stock issuable under the P-Tech Merger Agreement is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions involving DSKX common stock. 

&#160;

Following completion of the Mergers, Radiancy and PTECH will each continue to operate as separate subsidiaries of DSKX. Pursuant to a stockholders agreement to be entered into on the closing date (the &#8220;Stockholders Agreement&#8221;), the DSKX board of directors will be three current DSKX directors three current directors of the Company (Dolev Rafaeli, our chief executive officer, Dennis McGrath, our president and chief financial officer, and an independent director of the Company), and an additional independent director mutually acceptable to the Company and DSKX. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each committee of DSKX will contain at least one DSKX designee and one designee of the Company. The following decisions following the closing date, among others, will require five affirmative votes of the DSKX board of directors, including two designees of the Company: (a) material indebtedness of DSKX other than in connection with the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, (b) issuance of shares of DSKX common stock that would have a potential dilutive or impairment effect on the value of the consideration received by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreements, (c) entering into a sale of control of DSKX or of Radiancy and PTECH, and (d) acquisitions having a value in excess of $5.0 million. Following the closing date, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Company shall be generally restricted from selling more than 8-1/3% of the merger consideration it received over any 90 day period. It must notify DSKX fifteen business days prior to any sale to permit DSKX to repurchase, or arrange for a third-party to buy, such shares at the closing price on the date of such notice. Such prior notice and repurchase would not apply to any sales by the Company pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. The Stockholders Agreement would terminate upon a sale of control of DSKX or the Company beneficial ownership falling below 15%.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On the closing date, the Company and DSKX will also enter into a customary registration rights agreement, pursuant to which DSKX shall have an effective registration statement within 90 days thereof, and a transition services agreement pursuant to which the Company will provide DSKX certain specified services over a four month period following the closing date at a rate of $100 per month, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and certain consulting services for an 18 month period following the closing date.

&#160;

The Merger Agreements contain representations and warranties from the Company, Radiancy, and PTECH, on the one hand, and DSKX, Merger Sub A, and Merger Sub B, on the other hand, that are qualified by the confidential disclosures provided to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreements. The Merger Agreements include other affirmative and negative covenants of the parties which are customary in transactions of this type, including covenants by the Company not to solicit alternative transactions or to enter into discussions concerning, or to provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction, except under the circumstances permitted in the Merger Agreements. DSKX covenants that it will not, unless the Merger Agreements are otherwise terminated, solicit an alternative transaction or initiate or enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreements, the Company will be subject to five year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants following the closing date with respect to the businesses of Radiancy and PTECH. The Merger Agreement also contains mutual indemnification obligations. Other than certain fundamental representations and warranties, the Company&#8217;s indemnification obligations are subject to a $4.5 million cap and $150 deductible, with such representations and warranties generally surviving 18 months following the closing date. Additionally, the Company can satisfy its indemnification obligations by delivering shares of DSKX common stock, valued at the then market price as at the date such indemnification obligation is incurred.

&#160;

Additionally, each of the Company and DSKX covenant that it will file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) with respect to the Mergers within thirty days after the execution of the Merger Agreement. As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreements, each of the Company and DSKX received affiliate letters from the directors and officers of the other party to vote their respective shares of common stock in favor of the transactions.

&#160;

Completion of the Mergers is subject to a number of customary conditions, including the approval of the issuance of shares of DSKX common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreements by the stockholders of DSKX, the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company by the stockholders of the Company, and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

&#160;

The Merger Agreement, in addition to providing that the parties can mutually terminate the Merger Agreements, contains termination rights for the Company and DSKX, as the case may be, including, among others, upon: (1) final, nonappealable denial of required regulatory approvals or injunction prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (2) May 31, 2016, if the Mergers have not been completed by that time, provided that the parties may mutually agree to extend the Merger Agreements for an additional 90 days; (3) a breach by the other party that is not or cannot be cured within 30 days&#8217; notice if such breach would result in a failure of the conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreements to be satisfied; (5) failure of either DSKX or the Company&#8217;s stockholders to approve and adopt the required resolutions; or (6) failure by either the Company or the DSKX Board of Directors to recommend that its stockholders approve the required resolutions at a time that such recommendation is required or a withdrawal or adverse modification of that recommendation. The Company has the right to terminate the Merger Agreements under certain circumstances relating to other permitted acquisition proposals with respect to the Company and, in the event of such termination, the Company would be obligated to pay DSKX a termination fee of $3.0 million. The Company would also be obligated to reimburse DSKX, and DSKX would also be obligated to reimburse the Company, for its actual fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Mergers in an amount not to exceed $750 in the event that their respective stockholders do not approve the transaction at the meeting of stockholders called for that purpose. In the event of certain termination events available to the Company, DSKX would be obligated to pay the Company a termination fee of $3.0 million.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 23, 2016, DSKX filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the &#8220;DSKX March 23 Form 8-K&#8221;) with the SEC reporting its audit committee, after discussion with its independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of DSKX for the two fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 should no longer be relied upon because of certain errors in such financial statements. To the knowledge of DSKX&#8217;s audit committee, the facts underlying its conclusion include that revenues recognized related to certain customers of DSKX did not meet revenue recognition criteria in the two fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. Additionally, certain equity transactions in the two fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 were not properly recorded in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and also were not properly disclosed.

&#160;

DSKX&#8217;s audit committee and management had discussed these matters with DSKX&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, and both the audit committee and DSKX&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm are, as of the date of the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K, continuing to review the relevant issues. Based on current information as of the date of the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K, DSKX believes that the adjustments to such interim financial statements will be material when finalized. As such, DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that it intends to file amendments to its Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports for the periods ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, and restate the financial statements set forth therein, to the extent applicable, as soon as possible.

&#160;

Also, on March 23, 2016, DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that, on February 29, 2016, DSKX&#8217;s audit committee, consisting of all members of its board of directors other than Daniel Khesin (at the time DSKX&#8217;s President and Chairman of the Board and a member of its board of directors), engaged independent counsel to conduct an investigation regarding certain transactions involving Mr. Khesin and other individuals. DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that its audit committee started this investigation, without outside counsel, earlier in February. This investigation includes, but is not limited to, the revenue recognition and equity transactions discussed above. As of the date of the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K, DSKX reported that the investigation was ongoing.

&#160;

DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that, on March 17, 2016, all members of DSKX&#8217;s board of directors other than Mr. Khesin, terminated the employment of Mr. Khesin, as its president and as an employee of DSKX, and also terminated Mr. Khesin&#8217;s employment agreement, dated December 16, 2013. DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that all members of DSKX&#8217;s board of directors other than Mr. Khesin terminated both Mr. Khesin&#8217;s employment and employment agreement for cause. In addition, DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that all members of DSKX&#8217;s board of directors other than Mr. Khesin unanimously removed Mr. Khesin as Chairman and a member of DSKX&#8217;s board of directors, also for cause. DSKX reported in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K that DSKX&#8217;s board terminated Mr. Khesin for cause from both his employment and board positions because DSKX&#8217;s board believes, based on the results of the investigation as of the date of the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K, that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Mr. Khesin violated his fiduciary duty to DSKX and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

On March 23, 2016, DSKX provided Mr. Khesin with a copy of the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K, and DSKX reported that it provided Mr. Khesin with an opportunity to furnish DSKX with a letter addressed to DSKX stating whether he agrees with the statements in the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K and, if not, stating the respects in which he does not agree. On March 23, 2016, through his counsel, Mr. Khesin has advised DSKX&#8217;s audit committee that he disagrees with the findings of the audit committee and its independent counsel and believes that the termination as an executive officer of DSKX, removal from DSKX&#8217;s board of directors and termination of his employment agreement was not proper. DSKX filed the letter from Mr. Khesin&#8217;s counsel in response to his termination as an exhibit to the DSKX March 23 Form 8-K.

&#160;

The Company was not advised of this investigation during its negotiations with DSKX or after signing the Merger Agreements until the evening of March 21, 2016. The Company will continue to monitor this situation in order to determine what impact, if any, it may have upon the proposed transaction between the Company and DSKX. Depending upon the results of this investigation and any ancillary actions, it may be necessary to terminate the proposed transaction or to alter, amend or otherwise change the terms of that proposed transaction.

&#160;

DSKX reported in the DSKX March 28, 2016 Form 8-K that based upon on their review and to the knowledge of the audit committee of the Board, the errors in their previously filed financial statements totaled approximately $900 in reduced revenues. These errors included approximately $300 and $600 of revenues recorded in the second quarter and third quarter of 2015, respectively, that did not meet revenue recognition criteria. As a result, estimated unaudited 2015 fiscal year revenues should be reduced by approximately 6% to $13.0 million.

&#160;

In addition, 800,000 restricted shares of Company common stock were issued during the third quarter of 2015 as compensation under a contract with a purported foreign distributor which DSKX believes lacks future economic value. As a result, DSKX has elected to expense such shares in the third quarter of 2015. Another 350,000 shares of Company&#8217;s common stock were issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 to an investor relations firm for a one-year engagement which commenced in the third quarter of 2015. To the knowledge of management, no services have been provided by this investor relations firm to date. Accordingly, the entire amount of the equity award was recorded as an expense during the fourth quarter. For these as well as other reasons, it is DSKX&#8217;s position that all or a substantial portion of these restricted shares should be returned to DSKX for cancellation. DSKX intends to vigorously pursue its rights to recoup and cancel such shares.

&#160;

Discontinued Operations

&#160;

As stated above, on May 12, 2014, the Company acquired LCA. See ITEM 1. Business &#8211; Our Company . 

&#160;

LCA is a provider of fixed-site laser vision corrections services at its LasikPlus&#174; vision centers. This business, from May 2014 through December 31, 2014, was a fourth business segment for the Company, referred to as the Clinics Segment. Through this segment:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; We provided fixed-site laser vision correction services at our Lasik Plus &#174; vision centers. Our vision centers provided the staff, facilities, equipment and support services for performing laser vision correction that employ advanced laser technologies to help correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Our vision centers were supported by independent ophthalmologists and credentialed optometrists, as well as other healthcare professionals. The ophthalmologists performed the laser vision correction procedures in our vision centers, and ophthalmologists or optometrists conducted pre-procedure evaluations and post-operative follow-up care in-center. Most of our patients receive a procedure called laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (&#8220;LASIK&#8221;), which we began performing in the United States in 1996.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2014, we operated 59 Lasik Plus fixed-sited laser vision correction centers, generally located in metropolitan markets in the United States consisting of 51 full-service Lasik Plus fixed-site laser vision correction centers and nine pre- and post-operative Lasik Plus satellite vision centers. Included in the 51 full-service vision centers were four vision centers owned and operated by ophthalmologists who license our trademarks.

&#160;

The main product line through LCA was Laser vision correction procedures that reshape the cornea with an excimer laser to correct refractive vision errors by changing the curvature of the cornea. These procedures may reduce the need for wearing corrective lenses such as glasses and contact lenses. Our doctors make an assessment of a patient&#8217;s candidacy for laser vision correction and determine the correction required to program the excimer laser. The software of the excimer laser then calculates the number and pattern of pulses needed to achieve the intended correction using a specially developed algorithm. The typical laser vision correction procedure takes approximately 15 &#8211; 20 minutes to complete. The eye is anesthetized using topical eye drops. The patient reclines under the laser, a lid speculum holds the eyelids open, and the patient focuses on a blinking fixation light while the excimer laser pulses are applied. The excimer laser is a high-energy ultraviolet &#8220;cold&#8221; laser, meaning that no heat is generated. This non-thermal ablation permits precise reshaping of the cornea. The amount of tissue ablated and the ablation pattern depend upon the refractive error being corrected. Shortly after the procedure, the patient leaves the laser vision center with instructions to rest the remainder of the day. Follow-up visits with an optometrist or ophthalmologist are typically scheduled for one day, one week and one to three months post-procedure.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Influenced by the Chase Credit Agreement defaults of August 2014 and after preliminary investigations and discussions, the Board of Directors of the Company, with the aid of its investment banker, decided to enter into, substantive, confidential discussions with potential third-party buyers and began to develop plans for implementing a disposal of the assets and operations of the business. Effective January 31, 2015, PhotoMedex and LCA entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#34;Stock Purchase Agreement&#34;) with Vision Acquisition, LLC (&#34;Vision&#34;), under which Vision acquired LCA and its subsidiaries from PhotoMedex for a total purchase price of $40 million in cash (the &#34;Purchase Price&#34;). After giving effect to working capital and indebtedness adjustments and the payment of professional fees, the Company realized net proceeds of approximately $37.7 million from this sale, of which $2 million was placed in escrow at closing, but subsequently released upon fulfilling the requirements of release. Pursuant to the Termination of Joinder, dated as of January 31, 2015, LCA has been released from all of its obligations, including its guarantee and collateral obligations, in connection with the Facilities. The Company has used the proceeds from this transaction to pay down portions of its outstanding revolving line of credit and term loan under the Credit Agreement. As a result of that transaction, PhotoMedex&#8217;s creditors agreed to waive certain prepayments set for February 1st and February 15 th .

&#160;

Based on the above information, the Company accordingly classified this former segment as held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with ASC Topic 360.The results of operations of LCA-Vision have been included from May 13, 2014 through December 31, 2014 in the consolidated financial statements as assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2014. For the statement of operations, the activity related to LCA is captured as discontinued operations through the disposal date of January 31, 2015.

&#160; 

XTRAC&#174; EXCIMER LASERS 

&#160;

XTRAC is an excimer laser technology. It received an FDA clearance in 2000 and has since become a widely recognized treatment among dermatologists for psoriasis and other skin diseases for which there are no cures. Excimer lasers emit very concentrated UV light and are used in ophthalmology and dermatology practices. The XTRAC brand lasers deliver ultra narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) light to affected areas of the skin in order to treat an array of skin conditions, including psoriasis and vitiligo, which combined affect up to 10.5 million people in the U.S. and 190 million people worldwide.

&#160;

Also influenced by the Chase Credit Agreement default occurring in August 2014 and continuing until the debt was repaid in June of 2015 and after preliminary investigations and discussions, the Board of Directors of the Company, with the aid of its investment banker, decided to enter into, substantive, confidential discussions with potential third-party buyers and began to develop plans for implementing a disposal of the assets and operations of the XTRAC business. Effective June 22, 2015, PhotoMedex and MELA Sciences, Inc. entered into a Purchase Agreement (the &#34;Purchase Agreement&#34;) with Vision Acquisition, LLC (&#34;Vision&#34;), under which MELA acquired the XTRAC business and its India subsidiary from PhotoMedex for a total purchase price of $42.5 million in cash (the &#34;Purchase Price&#34;) including an escrow of $750.

&#160;

Based on the above information, the Company accordingly classified these related assets as held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with ASC Topic 360.The results of operations of the XTRAC business have been included from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 in the consolidated financial statements as assets and liabilities held for sale as of the December 31, 2014 balance sheet date. For the statement of operations, the activity related to the XTRAC business is captured as discontinued operations thru the disposal date of June 22, 2015.

Our Key Strategies

&#160; 

Our technologies, products and research efforts are directed to addressing a worldwide aesthetic industry valued at more than $34 billion annually. We provide dermatologists, professional aestheticians, and consumers with the equipment and skin care products they need to treat psoriasis, vitiligo, acne, and UV damage, among other skin conditions. In December 2011, PhotoMedex merged with Radiancy Inc. which brought to PhotoMedex the no!no!&#174; line of home-use consumer products for hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation and lower back pain. Radiancy also markets capital equipment to physicians, salons and med spas for hair removal, acne treatment, skin tightening and rejuvenation and psoriasis care. In addition to a synergistic product line, Radiancy possesses a proprietary consumer marketing engine built upon direct-to-consumer sales and creative marketing programs that drive brand awareness. After a period of significant growth and profitability following the PhotoMedex-Radiancy merger and then concurrent with entering into the Chase Credit Agreement and the merger with LCA-Vision, Inc., the company began to face a number of factors that caused the operating profitability of its consumer business to suffer. These factors included competition from consumer device companies claiming similar product functionality, the inability to purchase cost effective advertising to promote our consumer product portfolio, and the inability to effectively expand operations into foreign markets. Furthermore, after satisfying on June 23, 2015 the bank covenant defaults of our senior credit facility, we continued to face a challenging media environment to purchase cost effective advertisement in the USA, our largest product distribution market. Coupled with our inability to attract sufficient financial resources to quickly increase our advertisement to overcome the market confusion created by competitors and quickly ramp new and innovative product launches in the second half of the 2015, the company entertained a variety of inquiries to sell-off the remainder of its assets culminating in the February 2016 announcement of a transaction with DSKX whereby PhotoMedex, thru multiple concurrent merger transactions will sell to DSKX substantially of its remaining operations. See ITEM 1. Business &#8211; Our Company &#160; 

&#160;

The businesses which represent sunstantially all of the operations of the Company and are planned to be merged with DSKX and the strategies related to each of them are as follows:

&#160; 

Skilled Direct Sales Force to Target Physician and Professional Segments 

&#160;

PhotoMedex has long been active in physician sales, having developed a portfolio of medical devices and topical formulations that are provided under various financial arrangements primarily to dermatologists and plastic surgeons as well as other aesthetic professionals at salons and med spas. These products comprise medical lasers for skin diseases such as psoriasis and vitiligo, phototherapy for acne and sun damage, therapeutic skin care and surgical laser systems, among other products. One of our competitive advantages is an experienced, 44-person, physician-targeted sales force that is currently selling into 3,000 U.S. locations. We are focused on capitalizing on this skilled sales force in order to drive greater adoption of our line of proprietary products. These products provide skin rejuvenation, acne treatment, hair removal and other services for dermatologists and med spas

&#160; 

Expertise in Global Consumer Marketing 

&#160;

We have a highly advanced consumer sales engine accompanied by creative marketing programs, well-tested and successful direct-to-consumer marketing strategies and a global distributor and retail network. The no!no!&#174; products are sold throughout the world and in multiple countries, through infomercials and print, radio other television advertising worldwide, online, on home shopping channels and at stores and kiosks.

&#160;

We have continued to capitalize upon our consumer marketing expertise to further patient awareness of our NEOVA&#174; topical skin care products, which have traditionally been marketed only to physicians and aesthetic professionals. By incorporating a direct-to-consumer/patient element, we have increased brand awareness and direct patients into physicians&#8217; practices in search of these products. Our experience in effectively penetrating culturally distinct regions with targeted advertising is also anticipated to further benefit the expansion of our non-device technologies into global consumer channels.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Full Product Life Cycle Model 

&#160;

Since 2004, we have introduced a portfolio of professional-grade consumer products for hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation, facial skin tightening and lower back pain. These products - marketed globally under the no!no!&#174; and Kyrobak&#174; brands - are built upon the same technology platforms that are used in medical devices for physicians and aestheticians. We have been able to bring the clinical solutions used by physicians and med spas to the consumer home-use market by successfully miniaturizing equipment into handheld or lightweight convenient-to-carry products and engaging in a multi-faceted worldwide sales and marketing strategy. Under this type of &#8220;full product life cycle model,&#8221; the development of medical technology cleared through regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, and acceptance by physicians can ultimately lead to an effective new technology for consumer use.

&#160;

Once a product idea is generated, it is refined and tested through the development stage, which includes leveraging the knowledge of our Scientific Advisory Board; our marketing organization then works to encourage physician adoption of the new process/product. While many companies may stop at this point, our full product life cycle encourages us to continue to innovate and broaden our market opportunity by further miniaturizing professional technologies for home-use. Optimizing technologies for consumer use involves many considerations, including understanding and matching consumer expectations and providing superior customer service, eliminating the need for consumers to calibrate or safety test devices in the way that professionals are required to do for in-office capital equipment, and setting price points that are favorable for us but affordable for consumers. These key elements were the basis for Radiancy&#8217;s no!no!&#174; product line, which received the Consumer Survey of Product Innovation&#8217;s 2011 &#8220;Product of the Year&#8221; award in the At Home Beauty Treatment category and the HSN Most Innovative Product Award for 2012.

&#160; 

Our Global Growth Strategies 

&#160;

The global market for aesthetic devices and procedures continues to expand, driven by an individual desire to improve one&#8217;s appearance; a higher disposable income being spent on aesthetic treatments; an aging population in the industrialized world that desires a more youthful look; a younger generation seeking preventive solutions for the inevitable aging process; technological advances making products available to a consumer market that were previously only possible at the physician level; an increasing number of conditions, including acne and wrinkles, that can now be non-invasively treated; and a lower procedural cost, which has expanded the availability and affordability of many procedures to a greater number of individuals.

&#160;

We are focused on addressing the above-mentioned trends by growing and expanding our three core business segments: consumer, physician recurring and professional. We possess a solid line of technology platforms that are currently driving, and are expected to continue to drive, new product introductions and consequently greater revenues. We are focused on growth both through geographic expansion and the pursuit of additional diversified marketing initiatives that are intended to increase market share.

&#160;

Our three main sources of revenue generation from our three business segments: Consumer segment, Physician Recurring segment and Professional segment. For a period from May to December 2014 we had had one additional segment of business, the Clinics segment which represented the LCA Vision business. We also operated the XTRAC business through June 22, 2015 which generated Physician Recurring revenues from our USA business and Professional revenues from our International operations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Consumer Segment 

&#160; 

&#8226; Selectively expand into additional geographic markets. Part of our growth strategy includes implementing a global multichannel sales and marketing strategy. We have sold more than 5 million no!no!&#174; units to consumers, the majority of these over the past five years. Our ability to grow organically is significantly dependent upon the ability to advertise our products locally in a cost effective manner. The availability of cost effective advertising can be irregular and volatile at times. We continue to explore ways to expand our product distribution efforts to selective foreign markets where we can effectively advertise our products to our targeted demographic audience. We currently have operations in North America, United Kingdom, Israel and Hong Kong. &#160; 

&#8226; Strengthen our retail distribution channel. We intend to continue the expansion and growth of our retail presence in the US and internationally. The Company has a global retail footprint with more than 5,000 retail outlets worldwide. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and while continuing to face a challenging media market whereby only limited quantities of cost effective media are available to purchase and aimed at promoting our direct to consumer products, the company has intentionally directed more of its efforts and business development initiatives to increasing the market penetration and sales growth of our retail partners. &#160;

&#8226; Diversify media campaigns, extending beyond the historical overnight infomercial audience to also target short-form infomercials and daytime advertising. We will continue to search for ways to diversify our media campaigns beyond the overnight infomercial audience (the 28-minute infomercial) by testing a variety of formats searching for the optimum response and then directing resources to that format. Among a variety of ways to reach our end customer, we provide advertising messaging in short form formats including 30 second, 1 minute, 2 minute and 5 minute daytime media buys. Furthermore, we continue to test and expand a variety of media messages in various formats (TV, radio, print) and in multiple languages. In addition, the Company continues to seek alternative means of reaching consumers to create awareness of our products in order to reduce its reliance on traditional television advertising, particularly aimed at offsetting the long-term trends of consumers seeking forms of entertainment that are different from historical TV broadcast and cable formats. &#160; 

&#8226; Capitalize on our consumer marketing expertise to bring NEOVA&#174; and our other products into the consumer segment. With our marketing expertise, we are positioned to introduce other technologies&#8212;either via product extension from the health and wellness area of the no!no!&#174; and Kyrobak&#174; brands or from our NEOVA&#174; technologies &#8211; into the consumer markets &#160;

&#8226; Build out brand extensions of the no!no!&#174; and LHE and Kyrobak product lines into additional health and wellness areas. There are several additional brand extensions in the development pipeline that are in the process of being readied for launch, which could increase the growth trajectory of our existing product offerings. We are currently market testing our Clear Touch&#174; technology which is a handheld consumer product sold for the treatment of nail fungus. &#160;

&#8226; Leverage technology development in the physician and professional segments to drive new products for the consumer channel. We believe that our consumer line can continue to reach new customers. We have expertise in adapting products for consumer markets, as we have taken proprietary technologies focused toward physicians and med spas and adapted them to the home-use market and will attempt to continue to grow sales and increase gross margins in this manner. 

&#160; 

Physician Recurring Segment 

&#160;

NEOVA&#174; PHYSICIAN-DISPENSED SKIN CARE 

&#160;

Our NEOVA skin care line is designed as a therapeutic intervention for preventing premature skin aging due to UV-induced DNA damage. The topical technology seeks to repair photo-damaged skin using a novel combination of two key ingredients: DNA repair enzymes and our Copper Peptide Complex&#174;. Copper has been studied for more than 20 years for its wound healing applications. Research suggests that copper can be used to improve the elasticity of skin and is complementary to DNA repair enzymes, which repair damage caused by sunlight and other UV rays.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The NEOVA technology represents another opportunity to integrate our marketing platform with our direct sales force for plastic surgeons and dermatologists, which has traditionally been responsible for furthering market adoption of NEOVA products. Through a direct-to-consumer initiative, we seek to drive consumers to medical practices for NEOVA as well as to our website to buy direct.

&#160;

We hold several patents related to the NEOVA technology, as well as the ability to draw upon more than 150 peer-reviewed journal articles that provide scientific support for these ingredients.

&#160;

Professional Segment 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Sales under the professional business segment are mainly generated from capital equipment, namely our LHE&#174; brand products.

&#160;

We have an 18 person sales and marketing team calling directly on a network of approximately 2,000 physician locations in the U.S. In addition to representing our NEOVA dispensed skin care line, we distribute through this direct sales force the LHE-based professional products. We view this fully trained sales staff as a resource in expanding the Professional segment of our revenues. For markets outside the United States, we rely upon medical device distributors to promote our products to these markets.

&#160;

The LHE&#174; brand Technology combines direct heat and a full-spectrum light source to give a greater treatment advantage for acne care, skin tightening, skin rejuvenation, wrinkle reduction, collagen renewal, vascular and pigmented lesion treatments, and hair removal. Using LHE&#174;, the Mistral intelligent phototherapy medical device can treat a larger spot size than a laser with less discomfort. In addition, our research finds that LHE offers meaningful results for thin, light hair. The technology is also used in the no!no! Skin&#8482;, a handheld consumer product sold worldwide under the no!no!&#174; brand. The no!no! Skin&#8482; is a 510(k)-cleared product that has been clinically shown to reduce acne by 81% over 24 hours.

&#160; 

Our Products

&#160;

We emphasize the development of physician-endorsed skin care products based on science. Once cleared for use by the required regulatory agencies, like the FDA, these products are commercialized through a systematic, proprietary marketing program that we view as integral to our business success. Some of our products, which are described in more detail below, are expected to be significant growth drivers for us . Our primary technology and product platforms are described below.

&#160;

We evaluate four principal criteria in determining where to allocate product development resources:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; demonstrable clinical efficacy and safety; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; intellectual property protection; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; cost of goods; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; market opportunity. &#160;

Specifically, new projects must be able to work effectively, but also have a low enough cost of goods to achieve a favorable price point for consumers and a favorable margin for us to advertise our products effectively. As well, the market should be well defined and large enough to accommodate the new product with room for growth as we ramp up marketing efforts.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

These platforms include the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Our Thermicon&#174; technology and no!no!&#174; product line; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Professional equipment built upon our Light and Heat Energy (LHE&#174;) technology which is also incorporated into some of our consumer devices; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Our topical NEOVA&#174; formulations to combat UV-induced damage causing premature skin aging; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Our Kyrobak&#174; technology which incorporates Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) and Oscillation Therapy is for the relief of unspecified, lower back pain. &#160; 

THERMICON&#174; HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

Our no!no!&#174; hair removal products are built upon our proprietary heat-based Thermicon&#174; brand technology to address consumer concerns over perceived limitations of existing hair removal products, including safety and pain, and to overcome inherent limitations of light-based hair removal solutions. Unlike other products that use methods that are painful, have side effects, are limited in body areas that can be treated or that emanate from the principle of selective thermolysis, the Thermicon&#174; brand devices are based on heat only and are therefore applicable for all hair colors and skin types, can be used on all body areas, and if used per instructions do not have adverse events, and are virtually painless. Thermicon&#174; brand devices utilize a high-temperature thermodynamic wire filament that is activated when the devices are moved in contact with and across the treatment area. We believe that the no!no!&#174; brand hair removal products have several advantages over existing products for both the consumer and professional hair removal market, including:

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226;

Broad Applicability . Where other hair removal products such as shavers, waxing, threading and laser-based and intense pulsed light-based products are either limited by body area treated, are only effective at treating certain hair colors and skin types or are limited by the age of the consumer, products employing the Thermicon&#174; brand devices technology, which do not rely upon light, are virtually painless and without side-effects and are equally effective across all hair colors and all skin types. Therefore, we believe that unlike other hair removal methods (such as shaving, threading and waxing), including light based devices, Thermicon&#174; brand devices effectively remove hair on people with light hair or dark skin. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Compact Size . Since the Thermicon&#174; brand devices do not require large energy sources or cooling systems, we are able to produce compact, hand-held, portable, reachable wireless products uniquely suitable for the consumer market, without sacrificing safety or efficacy. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Pain-Free . Many traditional hair-removal procedures, such as waxing or shaving, can cause nicks, cuts and significant pain. We believe that users of products employing the Thermicon&#174; Brand devices experience only a mild tingling sensation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Low Cost of Goods to MSRP ratio. Thermicon&#174; brand technology has an average retail price of around two hundred and seventy dollars in the US and between three hundred and four hundred dollars in other markets. In contrast, other hair removal methods, require consumers to undergo expensive in-office (or in-spa) visits for treatments that can cost several thousands of dollars. The Thermicon&#174; brand platform enables a low cost of goods, and therefore a beneficial relationship cost of goods to MSRP. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

no! no!&#174; Product Line: &#8220;Professional Technology Made for Consumers&#8221; 

&#160; 

We have realized favorable market adoption of Thermicon&#174; brand technology, which not only overcomes the challenges of other hair removal methods but also puts control of the hair removal process in consumers&#8217; hands.

&#160;

We market a full line of consumer products based on the patented Thermicon&#174; brand technology. These products are sold globally through infomercials and television shopping channels, retail stores, online shopping websites and worldwide strategic distribution agreements.

&#160;

Since 2007, we have introduced a series of no!no! devices. Every product evolution&#8212;from the no!no! Classic&#8482;, the no!no! Hair&#8482;, the no!no! Hair for Men&#8482;, the no!no! Plus&#8482; to the no!no! PRO 3&#8482; and the no!no! PRO 5&#8482;&#8212;represents continued innovation and product line extension. Notably, each of the prior brands is still marketed even as we continue to introduce new product extensions like the no!no! Micro and no!no! Ultra launched in 2014. Going forward, we believe that the no!no! pipeline is considerable, with multiple new products and devices being developed with some that already have launched overseas. We are committed to effectively managing our product life cycle, seeking to ensure that, when there is a change in growth trajectory, we will likely possess new, enhanced technologies that are synergistic with our platform.

&#160;

The no!no! &#174; line of products also includes a consumables-based revenue model, which helps provide us with a growing, high-margin recurring revenue stream as consumers make repeat purchases of refill Thermicon tips, buffers and topical products.

&#160; 

LIGHT AND HEAT ENERGY (LHE &#174; ) 

&#160;

Our proprietary LHE&#174; brand technology combines the benefits of direct heat and a full-spectrum light source. This technology is used primarily in our professional products, which entail capital equipment sold to physicians and skin care specialists worldwide. This technology has also been adapted to our hand-held consumer line of products like no!no! Skin, a medical device for acne.

&#160;

LHE capitalizes upon the principles of selective photothermolysis, which is a type of photo (or light-based) therapy in which heat is generated using selective absorption of light within the targeted tissue. Selective photothermolysis entails precisely targeting a pigmented tissue or structure with a specific wavelength of light that is absorbed into and limited to the target area but does not penetrate into the surrounding area. Heat is also produced and directed to the target with minimal effect on surrounding skin.

&#160;

While there are many phototherapy options available for patients today, including laser and intense pulse light (IPL), we believe that we have optimized the light/heat relationship. Both Laser and IPL treatments filter out the heat given off by their flashes or pulses of light, primarily relying on the light energy to cause a clinical change. We believe that by not using the heat energy as well, laser and IPL technologies must be administered at high densities, which may require skin cooling techniques to protect patients from burns.

&#160;

In contrast, LHE technology was developed with the objective of efficiently using both light and heat energy to provide a greater treatment advantage. In doing so, LHE&#174; brand products can deliver less energy density (known as &#8220;low fluences&#8221;) to the target skin area, which is believed to create a safer, more efficient product. We believe that lowering the fluence of our LHE&#174; brand products reduces the need for skin cooling techniques, simplifies the treatment process and decreases the risk of harmful side effects. In addition, balancing light and heat enables phototherapy treatments for more sensitive skin types as well as a broader spectrum of hair colors.

&#160;

We have incorporated patented internal filters that protect the skin during treatment with LHE technology. We also offer a specialized light unit assembly for use on sensitive skin to further enhance our products&#8217; safety and comfort without compromising results.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of our LHE technology, we have created an LHE&#174; brand professional product line designed for clinical efficacy in a variety of applications, including psoriasis care, acne treatment, skin tightening, skin rejuvenation, wrinkle reduction, collagen renewal, vascular and pigmented lesion treatments and hair removal. (Note that not all applications are cleared in the U.S.)

&#160;

We believe that LHE can be more attractive than both laser and IPL technologies due to our cost structure, efficacy and ease of application. Medical devices that use LHE can treat a larger spot size than a laser-based system, with less discomfort and without requiring post-treatment skin cooling. As well, our research finds that our LHE approach offers meaningful results for thin and/or light hair. The technology also enables the development of smaller equipment, which is more affordable than bulky laser systems for many clinicians.

&#160;

Benefits of the LHE approach are summarized below.

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Non-invasive, non-abrasive treatments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; No down time; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Clinically proven results; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Safety and efficacy for all skin types; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Especially suited for Skin Types V-VI; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Easy to use &#160; 

The no!no! Skin&#8482; 

&#160;

LHE&#174; brand technology is also used in the no!no! Skin, a handheld consumer product sold worldwide under our no!no!&#174; brand. The no!no! Skin is a 510(k)-cleared product that has been clinically demonstrated to resolve or improve acne lesions by 81% within 24 hours. It uses the same LHE&#174; brand technology from our physician LHE&#174; brand products but is optimized for home use.

&#160;

The no!no! Skin puts out wide spectrum light (from 400 to 2,000 nm) and gentle pulses of heat to penetrate blocked pores and stop acne at its source. The device seeks to pinpoint Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ), or acne-causing bacteria, in the pore. The green light serves to stimulate the release of oxygen radicals, which attack the P. acnes . Simultaneously, the red light produces an anti-inflammatory reaction that reduces pimples&#8217; visible swelling. The addition of heat intensifies the process and gently opens the pores to release the clog and further soothe the inflammation.

&#160;

The no!no! GLOW applies the same LHE&#174; brand technology from our physician LHE&#174; devices but is optimally miniaturized for home use.

&#160; 

KYROBAK 

&#160;

Kyrobak uses clinically proven, proprietary technology to treat unspecified, lower back pain. The unique combination of Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) and Oscillation therapy is a non-invasive, relaxing method for long lasting relief of back pain. Used for better than 3 decades in professional rehabilitation and chiropractic settings, CPM has been proven to increase mobility of the joints, draw more oxygen and blood flow to the area, allowing the muscles to relax and release pressure between the vertebrae allowing the spine to open up and decompress.

&#160;

Given that back pain is the leading cause of disability in Americans under the age of 45 and that it affects 25 Million Americans, from 25- 64, annually, we believe the market need is unfilled and the population underserved. Through our direct-to-consumer initiatives, we will be targeting the estimated 80% of Americans who have suffered lower back pain at least once in their lives with the Kyrobak brand device and a series of accessories poised to grow the brand further.

&#160;

Clear Touch&#174; for Nail fungus 

&#160;

LHE brand technology is also used in the Clear Touch&#174;, a handheld consumer product sold for the treatment of nail fungus. Developed by Radiancy, LHE advances the principles of selective photothermolysis by utilizing the dual energy pathways of light and heat to gain the greatest advantage of the light/heat relationship. Patented internal filters protect the skin and proprietary algorithms take full advantage of the skins thermal absorption characteristics. These innovations create the exact balance of light and heat necessary to achieve clinical efficacy in a variety of clinical applications.

&#160;

Nail fungus is typically caused by a dermatophyte fungus that lives on the body as a result of direct contact. Dermatophyte fungi live on the epidermis layer of the skin and cause inflammation and infection to the surrounding area. The most common type of dermatophye fungus is Trichophyton Rubrum (or T. Rubrum). It is a mold fungus that thrives in damp, dark places, like close-toed shoes and is highly contagious. T.Rubrum can be transferred in two ways: skin-on-skin contact and surface contact with the infected area.

&#160;

Phototherapy Technology uses light by balancing wavelengths, intensity and exposure to treat specific dermatological conditions and is used around the world to professionally treat nail fungus in medical practices. Treatment time for the Clear Touch is about 10 seconds and repeated twice per day.

&#160; 

NEOVA&#174; PHYSICIAN-DISPENSED SKIN CARE 

&#160;

Our NEOVA skin care line is designed as a therapeutic intervention for preventing premature skin aging due to UV-induced DNA damage. The topical technology seeks to repair photo-damaged skin using a novel combination of two key ingredients: DNA repair enzymes and our Copper Peptide Complex&#174;. Copper has been studied for more than 20 years for its wound healing applications. Research suggests that copper can be used to improve the elasticity of skin and is complementary to DNA repair enzymes, which repair damage caused by sunlight and other UV rays.

&#160;

The DNA repair enzymes contained in the NEOVA formulation have several objectives:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Continuously repair and enhance skin&#8217;s natural processes; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Protect from UV immunosuppression; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Restore barrier function; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Promote collagen regeneration and skin elasticity; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Assist in correcting and improving cell metabolism. &#160;

In concert with the repair enzymes, NEOVA&#8217;s Copper Peptide Complex serves to promote new blood vessel growth and enhance the expression of growth factors. It stimulates collagen and elastin formation, which accelerate the repair process. Additionally, the Copper Peptide Complex is designed to mitigate damage caused by free radicals by promoting an antioxidant defense. Free radicals are a type of highly reactive oxygen molecule known to cause oxidative stress, which triggers harmful inflammatory responses and cell death as the free radicals attack DNA, lipids, proteins and other cell components. They are also believed to accelerate the progression of cancer, cardiovascular disease and age-related diseases, including cataracts, arthritis, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and diabetes. As typically occurs in normal, healthy cells, an antioxidant defense system comprising vitamins C and E and a variety of enzymes can minimize and repair free radical-induced damage.

&#160;

Among other products, the NEOVA line includes DNA Damage Control SILC SHEER SPF 45, an award-winning tinted sunscreen that contains micronized titanium dioxide, organic blockers and DNA repair enzymes to reduce risks of skin cancer and premature aging&#8212;both of which are caused by photo damage from sun exposure. The DNA repair enzymes are clinically shown to reduce UV damage by 45% and increase UV protection by 300% in one hour.

&#160;

NEOVA DNA Total Repair cream has been featured on The Doctors , a national daytime talk show that offers medical and health advice. The segment illustrated how the Total Repair product repairs damaged DNA in the cells of the skin in order to diminish age spots on someone who has used the cream consistently for two weeks. The guest testing the product reported that her hands had lightened considerably and some age spots had almost disappeared.

&#160;

The NEOVA technology represents another opportunity to integrate our marketing platform with our direct sales force for plastic surgeons and dermatologists, which has traditionally been responsible for furthering market adoption of NEOVA products. Through a direct-to-consumer initiative, we seek to drive consumers to medical practices for NEOVA as well as to our website to buy direct.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We hold over 13 patents related to the NEOVA technology, as well as the ability to draw upon more than 150 peer-reviewed journal articles that provide scientific support for these ingredients.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Certain of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially more resources. However, we believe that we are positioned to compete against a wide variety of peers, whether consumer-based companies of similar size or other companies competing in the aesthetics/physician channel. As it pertains to the aesthetic device market, this arena is complex and highly competitive&#8212;both for home use and treatment in a physician&#8217;s office. Over the past several decades, the aesthetics technology market has changed considerably due to technological innovation and discoveries. We are exposed to competition from small, closely held, specialized aesthetic device companies, such as Dezac Group, Home Skinovations Ltd., TRIA Beauty, Inc. and LumaTherm Inc. Several public companies, such as Syneron Medical Ltd. (ELOS-NASDAQ), Cynosure Inc. (CYNO-NASDAQ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRX-NYSE), are either looking to market or are already marketing consumer aesthetics products.

&#160;

Our no!no!&#174; products are energy-based. As such, energy-based aesthetic products may face competition from non-energy-based medical products, such as shaving, tweezing, waxing and creams.

&#160;

We believe that a significant barrier to entry into an applicable market is the cost basis of the product, since our products are based upon a proprietary technology that allows us to build products inexpensively. From a marketing standpoint, if competitors are developing a product that may compete with no!no!&#174;, they then become tasked with the challenge of building the marketing for that product. We invested roughly $44 million in 2015 in marketing and advertising. Furthermore, our comprehensive intellectual property position may serve as a deterrent to companies.

&#160;

We may also compete with pharmaceutical compounds and methodologies used to treat an array of skin conditions addressed by our professional products. Such alternative treatments may be in the form of topical products, systemic medications, and phototherapies from both large pharmaceutical and smaller laser companies.

&#160;

We currently face competitors offering discounted prices in some geographic markets where we conduct business. It is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected in the future by discounting practices of competitors, including from both a price and volume perspective. In individual markets, our challenge is to leverage the national strengths of our company and enhance local efforts in order to grow market share. 

&#160; 

Outsourcing and Fulfillment 

&#160;

We out-source the manufacturing of our Thermicon&#174; and LHE&#174; brand products while maintaining control over the production process. We believe that by outsourcing the manufacturing of each product, we can maintain low inventory levels and fixed unit costs, with minimal infrastructure, without incurring significant capital expenditures. We use third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain substantially all of the related product and packaging components and to manufacture these finished products. We believe that we have good relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these manufacturers or suppliers is not available or cease the conduct of its business. We continually review our manufacturing and supply needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers and suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs and operate more efficiently.

&#160;

We contract with third-party fulfillment vendors to package and distribute our Thermicon&#174;, LHE&#174; and skincare products primarily from our fulfillment facilities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

&#160;

We substantially outsource the manufacturing of our Skin Care products to OEM contract manufacturers. Quality control is performed at the OEM manufacturer and at our facilities in the U.S.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

As of April 7, 2016, our research and development team, including engineers, consisted of 3 employees. We conduct research and development activities at our facility located in Hod Hasharon, Israel. Our research and development expenditures were approximately $1.3 million in 2015, $1.8 million in 2014.

&#160;

Our research and development activities are focused on: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; the utilization of existing technologies to develop additional consumer and professional applications and products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; the development of new skin health and hair care products; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; the development of additional products and applications, whether in phototherapy or surgery, by working closely with our Scientific Advisory Board, medical centers, universities and other companies worldwide. &#160;

Patents and Proprietary Technologies

&#160;

We intend to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.

&#160;

Our policy is to file patent applications and to protect certain technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. As patents expire and expose our inventions to public use, we seek to mitigate the impact of such expirations by seeking protection of improvements. The patents in our Skin Care product line relate to use of our copper and manganese peptide-based technology for a variety of healthcare applications and to the composition of certain biologically active, synthesized compounds. Our strategy has been to apply for and maintain patent protection for certain compounds and their discovered uses that are believed to have potential commercial value in countries that offer significant market potential. As of December 31, 2015, we had 124 issued patents and 30 patent applications. In the U.S. alone, our business is protected by 19 patents.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We have licensed certain of our proprietary technology to third parties. We seek licenses from third parties for technology that can broaden our product and service offerings.

&#160;

We also rely on trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technology.

&#160;

Many of our products and services are offered under trademarks and service marks, both registered and unregistered. We believe our trademarks encourage customer loyalty and aid in the differentiation of our products from competitors&#8217; products, especially in our skincare products. Accordingly, we had 205 trademarks, either registered or being registered, in markets around the world that we intend to maintain in support of our products. These include 33 trademarks issued in the U.S. and 153 trademarks issued in the rest of the world. We periodically review the trademarks in our portfolio for usefulness with our existing and anticipated product lines; as a result, certain trademarks which were no longer in use in our business were not renewed.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulations Relating to Products and Manufacturing 

&#160;

Our products and research and development activities are regulated by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Any medical device or cosmetic we manufacture and/or distribute will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations govern the pre-clinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, use, labeling and promotion of medical devices, including our, LED devices, and other products currently under development by us and govern the manufacture and labeling of the cosmetic products. Product development and approval for medical devices within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.

&#160;

In the U.S., medical devices are classified into three different classes, Class I, II and III, on the basis of controls deemed necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices are subject to general controls, such as facility registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, premarket notification (unless the medical device has been specifically exempted from this requirement), adherence to the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, and requirements concerning the submission of device-related adverse event reports to the FDA. Class II devices are subject to general and special controls, such as performance standards, pre-market notification (510(k) clearance), post-market surveillance, and FDA Quality System Regulations. Generally, Class III devices are those that must receive premarket approval by the FDA to provide a reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting and implantable devices, or new devices that have been found not to be substantially equivalent to existing legally marketed devices.

&#160;

With limited exceptions, before a new medical device can be distributed in the U.S., marketing authorization typically must be obtained from the FDA through a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDA Act, or through a premarket approval application under Section 515 of the FDA Act. The FDA will typically grant a 510(k) clearance if it can be established that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that is a legally marketed Class I or II device (or to pre-amendments Class III devices for which the FDA has yet to call for premarket approvals). We have received FDA 510(k) clearance to market our LED products for a variety of indications for use. The FDA granted these clearances under Section 510(k) on the basis of substantial equivalence to other devices that had received prior clearances.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

For any devices that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, will require a new 510(k) submission. To date, we have not been required to secure premarket approval for our devices. A premarket approval application may be required for a Class II device if it is not substantially equivalent to an existing legally marketed Class I or II device (or a pre-amendments Class III device for which the FDA has yet to call for premarket approval) or if the device is a Class III premarket approval device by regulation. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of clinical trials, bench tests and possibly animal studies. In addition, the submission must include, among other things, the proposed labeling. The premarket approval process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing.

&#160;

We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and, as noted above, must comply with a number of regulatory requirements applicable to firms that manufacture medical devices and other FDA-regulated products for distribution within the U.S., including requirements related to device labeling (including prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses), facility registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, adherence to the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, good manufacturing processes and requirements for the submission of reports regarding certain device-related adverse events to the FDA.

&#160;

We have received approval from the European Union to affix the CE Mark to our LHE products. This certification is a mandatory conformity mark for products placed on the market in the European Economic Area, which is evidence that they meet all European Community, or EC, quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European medical device directives for the production of medical devices. This will enable us to market our approved products in all of the member countries that accept the CE Mark. We also will be required to comply with additional individual national requirements that are in addition to those required by these nations. Our products have also met the requirements for marketing in various other countries.

&#160;

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, refusals by the U.S and foreign governments to permit product sales and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As to our cosmetic products, the FD&#38;C Act and the regulations promulgated there and under other federal and state statutes govern the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of cosmetic products. Our cosmetic products and product candidates may be regulated by any of the various FDA Centers. Routinely, however, cosmetics are regulated by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. In other countries, cosmetic products may also be regulated by similar health and regulatory authorities. The skin care business also has two devices (e.g. wound care dressings) subject to 510(k) clearance, four products (e.g. sunscreen products) that contain drugs approved for use in over-the-counter products, and one prescription drug. Currently, the skincare products that are classified as drugs are not required to obtain pre-marketing regulatory approval. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and abroad for the manufacturing or marketing of our existing and potential skincare products is potentially costly and time-consuming and is subject to unanticipated delays. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed could also adversely affect our ability to clinically test, manufacture or market products.

&#160;

Failure to obtain regulatory approvals where appropriate for our cosmetic, device or drug product candidates or to attain or maintain compliance with quality system regulations or other manufacturing requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

We are or may become subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and policies relating to, among other things, safe working conditions, good laboratory practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with research and development.

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160;

Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws.

&#160; 

Anti-Kickback Laws 

&#160;

In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. The U.S. federal healthcare programs&#8217; Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities knowingly and willfully to solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering, any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute covers &#8220;any remuneration,&#8221; which has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the arrangement can be found to violate the statute. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, several courts have permitted kickback cases brought under the Federal False Claims Act to proceed, as discussed in more detail below.

&#160;

Because the Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly written and encompasses many harmless or efficient arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; For example, there are regulatory safe harbors for payments to bona fide employees, properly reported discounts and rebates, and for certain investment interests. Although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more of the exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that arguably implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute but do not fully satisfy all the elements of an exception or safe harbor may be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Many states have laws that implicate anti-kickback restrictions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply, regardless of whether federal health care program business is involved, to arrangements such as for self-pay or private-pay patients.

&#160;

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.

&#160; 

Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws 

&#160;

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid. The &#8220;qui tam,&#8221; or &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. Medical device companies, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, when they are deemed to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims.

&#160;

The False Claims Act also has been used to assert liability on the basis of misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered and in connection with alleged off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell our products and document our prices, such as the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.

&#160;

When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of five to eleven thousand dollars for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. A number of states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal civil False Claims Act and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any state or private third-party payor. In this environment, our engagement of physician consultants in product development and product training and education could subject us to similar scrutiny. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.

&#160; 

HIPAA Fraud and Other Regulations 

&#160;

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created a class of federal crimes known as the &#8220;federal health care offenses,&#8221; including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by means of false of fraudulent pretenses, any money under the control of any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Entities that are found to have aided or abetted in a violation of the HIPAA federal health care offenses are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. will be with governmental entities and therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws.

&#160; 

HIPAA and Other Privacy Regulations 

&#160;

The regulations that implement HIPAA also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as &#8220;covered entities.&#8221; Several regulations have been promulgated under HIPAA&#8217;s regulations including: the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or the Privacy Rule, which restricts the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information; the Standards for Electronic Transactions, or the Transactions Rule, which establishes standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or the Security Rule, which requires covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information. Although we do not believe we are a covered entity and therefore are not currently directly subject to these standards, we expect that our customers generally will be covered entities and may ask us to contractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements. While the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us.

&#160;

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, which was enacted in February 2009, strengthens and expands the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the restrictions on use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information. HITECH also fundamentally changed a business associate&#8217;s obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging patient identifiable health information for remuneration, restrictions on marketing to individuals, and obligations to agree to provide individuals an accounting of virtually all disclosures of their health information. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to report any unauthorized use or disclosure of patient identifiable health information, known as a breach, to the affected individuals, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and, depending on the size of any such breach, the media for the affected market. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. Most of the HITECH provisions became effective in February 2010. HHS has already issued regulations governing breach notification which were effective in September 2009.

&#160;

HITECH has increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA by either covered entities or business associates up to an annual maximum of $1.5 million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect. Imposition of these penalties is more likely now because HITECH significantly strengthens enforcement. It requires HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance beginning in February 2010 and to investigate any violation that involves willful neglect which carries mandatory penalties beginning in February 2011. Additionally, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules that threaten the privacy of state residents.

&#160;

In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of web site content. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Numerous other countries have or are developing laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal or patient information.

&#160;

HIPAA as well as other federal and state laws apply to our receipt of patient identifiable health information in connection with research and clinical trials. We collaborate with other individuals and entities in conducting research and all involved parties must comply with applicable laws. Therefore, the compliance of the physicians, hospitals or other providers or entities with whom we collaborate also impacts our business.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of April 7, 2016, we had 76 full-time employees, which consisted of two executive officers, 6 senior managers, 41 sales and marketing staff, 13 people engaged in operations, 3 engaged in research and development, and 11 finance and administration staff. We intend to hire additional sales personnel as the development of our business makes such action appropriate. The loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. Since there is intense competition for qualified personnel knowledgeable in our industry, no assurances can be given that we will be successful in retaining and recruiting needed personnel.

&#160;

Our employees are not represented by a labor union nor covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
