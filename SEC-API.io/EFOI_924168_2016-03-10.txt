 ITEM 1. &#32; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Energy Focus, Inc. and its subsidiaries engage in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, installation, and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems. We operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode ("LED") lighting products into the military maritime market, and general commercial and industrial markets. Recently, we have aligned our resources and focused our efforts on the sale of our LED lighting products, in particular our military and commercial tubular LED (&#8220;TLED&#8221;) lines of products, into targeted vertical markets. Our goal is to become a leader in the LED lighting retrofit market by replacing fluorescent lamps in general purpose and high-intensity discharge (&#8220;HID&#8221;) lighting in low-bay and high-bay applications with our innovative, high-quality TLED products. 

&#160; 

During 2014, we shifted our focus away from the turnkey solutions business operated through our subsidiary, Energy Focus LED Solutions, LLC, which had historically incurred lower gross margins, and as of September 2015, had fully exited the solutions business. In August 2015, we sold our United Kingdom subsidiary, Crescent Lighting Limited. As a result of exiting the turnkey solutions and Crescent Lighting Limited businesses, we have eliminated all net sales and expenses associated with both businesses from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and have reported the net loss as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for more information on our disposition of these businesses. 

&#160; 

The Company was founded in 1985 as Fiberstars, Inc., a California corporation, and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2006. In May 2007, Fiberstars, Inc. merged with and became Energy Focus, Inc., also a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 32000 Aurora Road, Suite B, Solon, Ohio 44139. Our telephone number is 440.715.1300. Our website address is www.energyfocusinc.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Our industry 

&#160; 

We are committed to developing and bringing our high-quality, energy-efficient, long-lived and mercury-free TLED products to our targeted military maritime, government, and commercial and industrial markets to replace linear fluorescent lamps in general purpose lighting applications and HID lamps in low-bay and high-bay lighting applications. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity for our business as the lighting market continues its transition to more energy-efficient technologies such as LED lighting, driven by technological improvements and emerging regulatory requirements. As the efficiency and cost of LED lighting continue to improve, we believe that market adoption will accelerate, particularly in commercial and industrial applications, due to the significant potential for energy savings and the early stage of LED adoption in these applications. 

&#160;

Our strengths and strategy 

&#160; 

Our LED products are more energy-efficient than traditional lighting products such as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, and we believe they can provide significant long-term energy and maintenance cost savings to potential clients. 

&#160; 

Our strengths, which we believe provide a strategic competitive advantage, include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

providing what we believe to be the only military-spec qualified LED fluorescent replacement lamps for the U.S. Navy; 

&#8226; 

owning and controlling the development, design, and construction of our TLED products to ensure performance, quality, and cost advantages; 

&#8226; 

providing our commercial Intellitube&#174; product, which we believe is the first single end powered TLED that is UL approved to work with both direct wire, as a single ended lamp, as well as an end-to-end lamp for direct fit into ballasted fixtures; 

&#8226; 

concentrated on developing and providing high-quality, price competitive TLED lamps to replace fluorescent and HID lamps for commercial and industrial markets; 

&#8226; 

a long developmental history, with broad and intimate understanding of lighting technologies and LED lighting applications; 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

a deep understanding of the adoption dynamics for energy-efficient lighting products in existing commercial and industrial building markets. 

&#160; 

Through our strengths, we seek to achieve the following objectives: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

become the LED lighting leader in the targeted markets; 

&#8226; 

continuing sales growth and profitable financial performance; 

&#8226; 

further penetration of our military-grade LED lighting products to the military maritime market, including both the U.S. Navy and allied foreign navy market; 

&#8226; 

replication of our success in the military maritime market by penetrating the government and commercial vertical markets for our commercial LED lighting products; and 

&#8226; 

a streamlined and high-performing organization that is focused on providing industry-leading LED lighting products that generate energy savings and reduce carbon emissions for our clients. 

&#160; 

Our strategy to achieve these objectives includes the following actions: 

&#8226; 

continue to utilize our patents and proprietary know-how to develop innovative LED lighting products that are differentiated by their quality, reliability, adaptability and cost of ownership; 

&#8226; 

increase awareness and knowledge of our technology and offerings within our targeted markets; 

&#8226; 

establish relationships with key clients and early adopters to demonstrate our technology and value in targeted vertical markets; 

&#8226; 

rapidly scale our sales efforts to increase the penetration of our technology in our targeted markets; and 

&#8226; 

expand selectively into geographical markets. 

Targeted vertical markets 

We are focusing on markets where the economic benefits of our lighting product offerings are most compelling. To do so, we are currently targeting specific vertical and geographic segments within three markets: military maritime, government, and commercial and industrial. 

We have achieved substantial growth in the military maritime market since 2014, capitalizing on our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Navy and our status as what we believe to be the only U.S. Navy military-spec qualified TLED lamp provider. In the second half of 2014, we began receiving sizable orders for our military Intellitube &#174; &#32;product as the Navy embarked on a fleet-wide LED retrofit project. Sales of our products to the U.S. Navy or distributors for the U.S. Navy were approximately $ 51.3 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 80 percent &#32;of total net sales. Through December 31, 2015, we believe approximately 30 percent of the Navy&#8217;s potentially replaceable fluorescent tubes have been retrofitted with our military Intellitube &#174; &#32;product. 

We are optimistic that we will continue generating strong sales of our military Intellitube &#174; &#32;product in the near-term as the transformation of the U.S. Navy fleet to LED lighting continues. In addition, we announced our first order for the Royal Australian Navy in the second quarter of 2015, and we believe there is a significant opportunity to build on our success with the U.S. Navy by targeting allied foreign navies in the long term. We also believe that our success and experience working with the U.S. military, coupled with the introduction of our commercial Intellitube &#174; &#32;product in the second quarter of 2015, as well as our capability to manufacture &#8220;Buy American&#8221; products, provides an enhanced opportunity for us to market our products to approximately 200 major military bases in the U.S. Our efforts with military bases are still in the early stages, but we are actively pursuing the opportunity. 

In the commercial and industrial markets, we are currently targeting the following verticals in the United States: healthcare, education, industrial and manufacturing, and national retail. 

In healthcare, we are currently working with several hospital systems to introduce our products and demonstrate our technology. Given the 24/7 lighting requirements of hospital systems, we believe the quality and value of our products are particularly attractive. We are aggressively expanding our sales effort in the healthcare vertical market in an attempt to increase our penetration, and in 2015 announced a supply agreement with a major northeast Ohio hospital system to retrofit the system&#8217;s main campus. 

In education, we are gaining traction in the K-12 market and have received orders to retrofit school districts in various states. In addition, through a partnership in the TLED category with the Center for Green Schools at the U.S. Green Building Council that we announced in the second quarter of 2015, we are working to build awareness and adoption of our LED lighting technology in schools initially within our current geographic markets, including the North East, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. As we advocate for the benefits of LED lighting in schools, both in terms of energy-efficiency and in creating a healthy learning environment, we believe additional opportunities to penetrate the K-12 market will arise. 

We are also in the early stages of our efforts in the industrial and manufacturing and national retail vertical markets, which are large addressable markets and provide an attractive opportunity for us. In the industrial and manufacturing market in particular, due to the usage of HID lighting, the energy savings that can be achieved by switching to our LED products could be substantial and we believe we have attractive product offerings in this space. 

Sales and marketing 

&#160; 

Our products are sold through a combination of direct sales employees, independent sales representatives, electrical and lighting contractors, and distributors. 

We currently sell the majority of our products for the U.S. Navy through distributor and sales representative arrangements. Until the third quarter of 2015, our primary distributor was LED Lighting Solutions Global, LLC (an affiliate of Energy Management Products, LLC) (&#8220;LLS&#8221;), which now serves as a sales representative with respect to our U.S. Navy business and a distributor for foreign navies and the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command. In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into exclusive distribution agreements for 2016 with Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc. (&#8220;ADS&#8221;) and LLS, under which ADS and LLS purchase our products under minimum commitment requirements for supply to the U.S. Navy, and to foreign navies and the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command, respectively. Sales of our products for the U.S. Navy through ADS and LLS combined were $48.2 million &#32;during 2015, or 75 percent &#32;of our total sales for the period. The remainder of our sales of products for the U.S. Navy in the year ended December 31, 2015 were made pursuant to a contract we were awarded in 2011. 

Within the commercial and industrial market, we continue to focus on direct corporate accounts, general contractors, and lighting retrofit companies (&#8220;LRCs&#8221;) especially in the healthcare, education, industrial and manufacturing, and retail markets. We intend to continue to expand our business development capabilities, sales organizations, and geographic markets to support our efforts in these areas. 

&#160; 

Concentration of sales 

&#160; 

In 2015, sales of our products to the U.S. Navy or to distributors for the U.S. Navy accounted for approximately 80 percent &#32;of net sales from continuing operations. Customers accounting for greater than 10 percent of our net sales from continuing operations included LLS, which accounted for approximately 59 percent , and ADS, which accounted for approximately 16 percent . There were no other customers accounting for greater than 10 percent of our net sales. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our commercial lighting products compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and HID lamps, as well as other TLEDs and full fixture lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower lifecycle cost of our products. Principal competitors in our markets include large lamp manufacturers and lighting fixture companies, as well as Asian TLED manufacturers whose financial resources may substantially exceed ours. These competitors may introduce new or improved products that may reduce or eliminate some of the competitive advantage of our products. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. In certain commercial applications, we compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies such as Royal Philips, CREE, Inc., Osram Sylvania, and GE, Inc. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products. 

&#160; 

In our military product line, we compete with a small number of qualified military lighting lamp and fixture suppliers, who in the future might also provide LED lighting products. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and suppliers 

We produce our lighting products and systems through a combination of internal manufacturing and assembly at our Solon, Ohio facility, and sourced finished goods. Our internal lighting system manufacturing consists primarily of final assembly, testing, and quality control. We have worked with a number of our vendors to design custom components to meet our specific needs. Our quality assurance program provides for testing of all sub-assemblies at key stages in the assembly process, as well as testing of finished products produced both internally and sourced through third parties. 

In an effort to reduce manufacturing costs, we have outsourced the production of certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in certain product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States and China. In some cases, we rely upon a single supplier to source certain components, sub-assemblies, or finished goods. We continually attempt to improve our global supply chain practices in order to satisfy client demands in terms of quality and volumes, while controlling our costs and achieving targeted gross margins. 

Additionally, we are establishing a "Buy American" line of TLEDs and we believe this will offer us a competitive advantage in certain targeted vertical markets. 

&#160; 

Product development 

&#160; 

Product development is a key area of focus for us. Our product development team is dedicated to developing and designing leading LED lighting products, and we have recently opened product development centers in Taiwan and Minnesota. 

&#160; 

Gross product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;were $3.0 million , $1.7 million , and $3.5 million &#32;respectively. As we previously announced, in 2014 we curtailed our efforts on bidding on research contracts and grants in order to focus our resources exclusively on projects and contracts that support LED technologies. 

&#160; 

Intellectual property 

&#160; 

We have a policy of seeking to protect our intellectual property through patents, license agreements, trademark registrations, confidential disclosure agreements, and trade secrets as management deems appropriate. We have approximately 10 patents that we consider key to our current product lines. Additionally, we have various pending United States patent applications, and various pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization that serve as the basis for national patent filings in countries of interest. Our issued patents expire at various times through July 2032. Generally, the term of patent protection is twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. There can be no assurance; however, that our issued patents are valid or that any patents applied for will be issued, and that our competitors or clients will not copy aspects of our lighting systems or obtain information that we regard as 

proprietary. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to ours. The laws of some foreign countries in which we sell or may sell our products do not protect proprietary rights to products to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

All of our properties and equipment are covered by insurance and we believe that such insurance is adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance in amounts we believe to be consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 122 full-time employees, 4 of whom were located in Taiwan and 118 in the United States. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Business segments 

&#160; 

During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the exit of our turnkey solutions business and reported the historical results of that business as discontinued operations. We currently operate in a single business segment that includes the marketing and sale of commercial, industrial, and military maritime lighting products, and research and development services. Our products are sold primarily in North America through a combination of direct sales employees, independent sales representatives, and distributors.
