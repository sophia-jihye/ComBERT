Organization 

&#160; 

We are a Nevada corporation formed on April 17, 2014, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacroSolve, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (&#8220;MacroSolve&#8221;). Effective April 30, 2014, MacroSolve merged with and into our Company, with our Company as the surviving entity, for purposes of moving our state of incorporation from Oklahoma to Nevada (the &#8220;Redomestication&#8221;). Any references to &#8220;Drone Aviation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;DAC&#8221;, or the &#8220;Company&#8221; or any similar references relating to periods before the Redomestication shall be construed as references to MacroSolve, being the previous parent company of Drone Aviation. 

&#160; 

Upon consummation of a share exchange with Drone Aviation Corp. (&#8220;Drone&#8221;) on June 3, 2014 (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;), Drone became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we began a new line of business in the tethered drone space. On March 26, 2015, we filed a Plan of Merger in the State of Nevada, pursuant to which Drone was merged into our Company which is the surviving corporation. 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 11651 Central Parkway #118, Jacksonville, FL 32224 and our phone number is (904) 834-4400.

Corporate Structure 

&#160; 

Our current corporate structure is set forth below: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are focused on the business of the design, development, marketing and sale of lighter-than air (&#8220;LTA&#8221;) advanced aersostats, tethered drones, and land-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (&#8220;ISR&#8221;) solutions. We, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (&#8220;LTAS&#8221;), which was acquired on June 3, 2014 upon consummation of a Share Exchange with Drone Aviation Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary which was merged into Drone Aviation on March 26, 2015, are focused on the development of tethered aerostats known as the Winch Aerostat Small Platform (&#8220;WASP&#8221;) as well as certain other tethered drone products including the WATT electric tethered drone launched on March 2, 2015. The WATT is our first model of a new line of commercial-grade electric tethered drones designed to provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

We, through our wholly owned subsidiary, LTAS, are focused on the development of tethered aerostats known as the WASP and certain other tethered drone based products, including the recently announced WATT tethered drone. The tethered aerostat system is a lighter-than-air, compact aerostat platform either self-contained on a trailer that can be towed by a Military All-Terrain Vehicle, or MATV, or Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, or other standard vehicle, or it can operate from the bed of a pickup truck. It is designed to provide semi-persistent, mobile, real-time day/night high definition footage for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (&#8220;ISR&#8221;), detection of improvised explosive devices (&#8220;IEDs&#8221;), border security and other governmental and civilian uses. The WASP is a mobile, tactical-sized aerostat capable of carrying a variety of payloads in support of military operations. All of our products can also be utilized for disaster response missions, by supporting two-way and cellular communications, and act as a repeater or provide wireless networking. 

&#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The aerostat systems have a tethered envelope filled with helium gas, either a stabilized ISR payload or communications payload, portable ground control station and a datalink between the ground station and the envelope. Hovering at up to 2,000 ft. above the ground, the systems provide surveillance and communications capabilities with relatively low acquisition and maintenance costs. The systems require an operational crew of a minimum of two personnel, relatively simple maintenance procedures and a quick retrieval and helium top-off for re-inflation. 

&#160; 

The WASP is a mobile, tactical-sized aerostat capable of carrying a variety of payloads in support of military operations helping troops in the field have a tactical edge while communicating over greater distances. The WASP leverages aerostat technology to elevate network payloads to an advantaged height to enable persistent network connectivity while reducing risk to units conducting missions.

&#160;

In 2014, BAE systems procured two WASP systems which were delivered to the U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command (&#8220;SMDC&#8221;). The WASP Systems provided to the SMDC/Army Forces Strategic Command participated in the U.S. Army's Network Integration Evaluation (&#8220;NIE&#8221;) 14.1 where they were a &#8220;System Under Evaluation,&#8221; meaning that they were used to test other new systems. The two WASPs returned to NIE 14.2 which took place at Fort Bliss, TX and White Sands Missile Range, NM during April and May 2014, as a &#8220;Baseline System&#8221; following their successful mission at NIE 14.1. The NIE 14.2 exercises were intended to evaluate joint force network capabilities; improve unified land operations with communications nodes based on aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); integrate networking technologies into the armored brigade combat team; develop ways to deliver, collect and process integrated, multi-source intelligence to front-line warfighters; and make field command posts more mobile and efficient. The NIE 14.2 exercises also involved beyond-line-of-sight communications; expeditionary signal brigade tropospheric scatter communications; network intrusion prevention; cellular communications; electromagnetic spectrum operation; condition based maintenance; and operational energy solutions.

&#160;

In 2015, the U.S. Army-owned WASP tactical aerostats also successfully completed the DoD Enterprise Challenge 2015 (&#8220;EC15&#8221;), a program created to explore how various technologies could collect, send and retrieve data from the field through a secure, interconnected network of multiple agencies, partners and organizations, providing access to real-time data and video. During EC15, the WASP systems were used to capture and relay real-time, high definition video to various handheld devices, tablet computers and other deployed systems. In September 2015, the WASP systems also took part in the latest Army NIE exercise, NIE 16.1 which focused on new technologies assessments including coalition network capabilities, expeditionary command posts, operational energy capabilities, and manned/unmanned teaming (air and ground robotics). As a result of its performance, DAC will continue to support the U.S. Army-owned WASP systems for future exercises scheduled for 2016.

&#160;

On March 2, 2015 we announced that we had officially launched WATT, our first model of a new line of commercial-grade electric tethered drones designed to provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether. Our tethered electric drone product line consists of electrically powered drones connected to a ground-based software controlled winch via a safe and secure armored tether line. The concept of the tethered drone system is built on the strength of our years of developing tethered solutions for our aerostat products and combining that with the advantages of multi-rotor copters. The end result is a robust capability designed to be used in almost all weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. The initial tethered drone known as the WATT is being designed to take off, hover and land via remote control while being connected by a unique tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on in our launcher systems are being incorporated into the self-contained copter system in order to produce a heavier-than-air, tethered product offering. The WATT is a complete turnkey system that can be launched within minutes of unpacking from a standard case stored in a host vehicle. Once launched, WATT is designed to hover in a stationary position directly above its launch site at one of several preset altitudes of up to 300 ft. for up to 8 hours where a highly stabilized military-grade/broadcast quality HD video imager can provide a 360&#176; live aerial monitoring feed directly through the tether to its host vehicle or to a network of mobile devices such as tablets or laptop computers. Compact and lightweight, the WATT system features the ability to draw power from both its host vehicle or independently provide up to 8 hours of operation through its own ground power equipment that is specially designed to be transported and deployed from commercial vehicles such as TV production trucks, first responder vehicles or even common agriculture/infrastructure equipment thanks to its standard 120v adapter.

&#160; 

Market 

&#160; 

The market for our LTAS and tethered drones has grown significantly over the last several years following the recent proposed guidelines by the FAA for commercial drone use for which our tethered drone product line is designed to comply. The military has transformed into a smaller, more agile fighting force in need of a network of technologies to provide improved observation, communication and precision targeting of combat troop locations, which are often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations. Our products are intended to provide critical observation and communication capabilities serving the increased demand for ISR and communications, including real-time tactical reconnaissance, tracking, combat assessment and geographic data, while reducing the risks to our troops in theatre. Finally, in a highly constrained fiscal environment, we believe the typically lower acquisition and use/maintenance costs of LTA aerostats and tethered drones make them more appealing when compared to their heavier than air manned or larger LTA unmanned system alternatives. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The markets for our systems on a stand-alone basis and/or combined with other payloads relates to the following applications, among others:

&#160;

Governmental Markets: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; International, Federal, state and local governments as well as U.S. and foreign government agencies, including U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), U.S. Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of State, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. and state Departments of Transportation, Penitentiaries, and Police forces; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Military, including U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Agency (SMDC) and U.S. Air Force installations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance (ISR), including Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Border security monitoring, including U.S. Homeland Security, to deter and detect illegal entry; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Drug enforcement along U.S. borders; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Monitoring environmental pollution and sampling air emissions; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Vehicle Traffic monitoring, including aerial speed enforcement by state and local law enforcement agencies. &#160; 

Commercial Markets : 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; TV and Media Production Mobile communications systems, expanding on-site reporting capabilities to include aerial videography and photography; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Agriculture monitoring, including monitoring crop health, field monitoring to reduce costs and increase yields; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Security for large events, including crowd management; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Natural disaster instant infrastructure to support first responders; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Oil pipeline monitoring and exploration; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Atmospheric and climate research. &#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

We sell our products directly to end customers. In addition, our products are included in the GSA Schedule, which allows government customers to directly negotiate and acquire products and services from commercially-listed suppliers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for the LTAS aerostat systems include product performance, features, acquisition cost, lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, size, mobility, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation. 

&#160; 

We believe the current market competitors to the WASP aerostat systems include a large number of not only small &#8220;mom and pop&#8221; tethered aerostat and balloon companies but large defense contractors, among them: TCOM, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ISL, ILC Dover, Compass Systems, Raven Aerostar and American Blimp Corporation. We believe there are numerous &#34;hobbycraft&#34; drone companies such as DJI and Parrot offering hobby grade free flying drones for pleasure use, as well as many larger drone manufactures such as Northrup Grumman and Boeing, offering military grade free flying drones to the U.S. Government. There are very few commercial grade tethered drone competitors for our tethered drone systems which remain tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether, but among them are Elistair located in Lyon, France and Cyphy Works Inc. located in Danvers, MA. 

&#160; 

Many of our LTA competitors have received considerable funding from government or government-related sources to develop and build LTA aerostats. Most of these organizations and many of our other competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources and capabilities than we do. We anticipate increasing competition as a result of defense industry consolidation, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position and ability to compete against us. In addition, other companies may introduce competing aerostats or solutions based on alternative technologies that may adversely affect our competitive position. As a result, our products may become less or non-competitive or obsolete. 

&#160; 

Technology, Research and Development 

&#160; 

We conduct the development, commercialization and construction of the WATT tethered drone and WASP aerostat systems in-house. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our research and development efforts are largely focused on the tethered drone systems and aerostat systems. We have developed a &#8220;non-military spec&#8221; aerostat system for use in more commercial or governmental applications that does not require the level of durability and ruggedness of the current militarized model and we continue to work on different models with different payloads for various applications. 

&#160; 

The concept of the WATT system is built on the strength of our years of developing tethered solutions for our aerostat products combined with the advantages of rotor copters. The end result is a robust capability that is designed to be utilized in almost all weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. The DAC tethered drone is designed to take off, hover and land via remote control all while being connected by a unique tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on from our launcher systems are incorporated into the self-contained DAC tethered drone system in order to produce a unique heavier than air, tethered product offering. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we spent $744,452, and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we spent $142,011 on research and development activities. 

&#160; 

Partners 

&#160; 

We are party to several agreements with partners and distributors to assist us with the marketing and sales of various products, as we currently have limited in-house sales capabilities. Current relationships include: 

&#160;

&#9679; A sales and distribution partnership with U.S. government prime contractor ADS Inc. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Signed in March 2015, a 3 year sales, marketing and integration partnership with L3 for a &#8220;L3-Branded&#8221; WASP targeting prime contract customers. &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We review each of our intellectual properties and make a determination as to the best means to protect such property, by trademark, by copyright, by patent, by trade secret, or otherwise. We believe that we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual properties, based on our evaluation of the factors unique to each such property, but cannot guarantee that this is the case. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent No. 7,822,816 to MacroSolve. The patent covers certain mobile information collection systems across all wireless networks, smart phones, tablets, and rugged mobile devices, regardless of carrier and manufacturer. In September 2011, MacroSolve filed a continuation of U.S. Patent No. 7,822,816 which is assigned number 12/910,706. On March 7, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) sent MacroSolve an office action related to an ex parte reexamination of the &#8216;816 patent which rejected all the claims in the patent. As a result of the office action, the &#8216;816 patent was deemed unlikely to produce future revenues. 

&#160; 

On September 18 and 19, 2014, we filed provisional patent application numbers &#8220;62/052,289&#8221; and &#8220;62/052,946&#8221; entitled &#8220;Tethered Portable Aerial Media broadcast System&#8221; based on the tethered drone system. On September 18, 2015, we filed a utility patent application claiming a priority date of the two provisional patent applications and having application Serial Number &#8220;14858467&#8221; entitled &#8220;Apparatus and Methods for Tethered Aerial Platform and System&#8221;. On July 7, 2015 we filed a provisional patent application number &#8220;62/189,341&#8221; entitled &#8220;Apparatus, Methods and System for Tethered Aerial Platform&#8221;. Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As we continue the development of the tethered drone and aerostat systems, we expect that we will rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered the trademark Blimp in a Box. In certain cases, when appropriate, we opt to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets as opposed to filing for patent protection in order to preserve confidentiality. All of our employees are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

Dependence on a Few Customers and Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

We believe there is a large, growing market for our commercial tethered drones internationally as well as in the U.S. With the recent proposed guidelines for commercial drone use in the U.S. by the FAA, we anticipate a growing U.S. market for commercial drone applications that our tethered drones can serve. Until the FAA officially adopts and publishes these guidelines, we are restricted to operating our tethered drones in the National Air Space (NAS) under either FAA granted exemptions or Certificate of Authorizations. We are currently engaged with commercial and research organizations in order to determine how our tethered drones can be operated under FAA exemptions or COA's until the FAA formally adopts a policy for commercial drone use in the NAS. We are currently evaluating various international markets where the FAA does not control the airspace where our tethered drones can potentially be operated by potential customers. We anticipate that the majority of our LTA based revenue at least in the foreseeable future will come from U.S. government and government-related entities, including both the DoD and other departments and agencies. Government programs that we may seek to participate in must compete with other programs for consideration during Congress&#8217;s budget and appropriations hearings, and may be affected by changes not only in political power and appointments but also general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. Reductions, extensions or terminations in a program that we are seeking to participate in or overall defense spending could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and realize any profits. We cannot predict whether potential changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities will afford opportunities for our business in terms of research and development or product contracts, but any reduction in government spending on such programs could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues. 

&#160; 

We have registered as a contractor with the U.S. Government and are required to comply with and will be affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of any then existing contracts or the inability to bid on future contracts. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Since our LTA systems are tethered to the ground they are required to comply with regulations enforced by the FAA, which currently does not allow any commercial untethered flights by free flying drones in commercial airspace in the U.S. without prior FAA clearance certifications or an FAA Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) that are difficult and time-consuming to obtain. &#160;

International sales of our products may also be subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies like the United States Department of State restrictions on the transfer of technology, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other export laws and regulations and may be subject to first obtaining licenses, clearances or authorizations from various regulatory entities. This may limit our ability to sell our products abroad and the failure to comply with any of these regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and generate revenues as well as increase our operating costs. Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate wireless communications. 

Sources and Availability of Components &#160; 

Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom made for those products and are available only from either a single or limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement supplier&#8217;s components is inferior or unacceptable. &#160; 

Employees &#160; 

We have four full-time employees and two part-time consultants that comprise our executive management and accounting team. LTAS has five full-time and fourteen part-time employees. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory. &#160; 

Recent Developments &#160; 

&#160; &#9744; On February 2, 2016, we announced a follow-up order from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for an aerostat and related airborne equipment and operator training. 

&#160; &#9744; On January 25, 2015, we announced a partnership for sales, operating, training and support of the WATT-200 tethered drone with Measure UAS, Inc. Measure has been granted a 333 exemption by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate the WATT-200 for their Drone as a Service operations. 

&#160; &#9744; On January 11, 2016 we announced a joint sales partnership with Skyfire Consulting, a drone services and consulting company serving first responders nationwide. The companies presented the WATT line of tethered drones at the annual Fire-Rescue East 2016 Conference in Daytona Beach, Florida in January 2016. 

&#160; &#9744; On January 6, 2016 our common stock commenced trading on the OTCQX Market. 

&#160; &#9744; On July 20, 2015, we closed an asset purchase agreement for the purchase of substantially all the assets of Adaptive Flight, Inc., (&#8220;AFI&#8221;). The Asset Purchase Agreement was entered into by and among the Company, AFI, the shareholders of AFI, and Drone AFS Corp., a Nevada corporation formed by the Company for the purpose of effecting the asset purchase. AFI was in the business of designing and developing flight control systems for unmanned aerial vehicles. Among the assets we acquired are commercial software licenses for the &#8220;GUST&#8221; (Georgia Tech UAV Simulation Tool) autopilot system, and other transferable licenses which include flight simulation and fault tolerant flight control algorithms. 

&#160; &#9744; In July, 2015, the U.S. Army-owned WASP tactical aerostats successfully completed the DoD Enterprise Challenge 2015 (&#8220;EC15&#8221;) providing real-time situational awareness to participating ground forces and personnel. As a result of its performance, DAC will continue to support the U.S. Army-owned WASP systems for future exercises scheduled for 2016. The Enterprise Challenge program was created to explore how various technologies could collect, send and retrieve data from the field through a secure, interconnected network of multiple agencies, partners and organizations, providing access to real-time data and video. The WASP systems were used to capture and relay real-time, high definition video to various handheld devices, tablet computers and other deployed systems. 

&#160; &#9744; We provided two WASP systems and six aerostats in 2013 to BAE Systems to support the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC). We delivered self-contained, compact, trailer-mounted aerostat launcher system and aerostats, which are undergoing testing and evaluation for various mission profiles to support and enhance critical communications for the Army. In 2015 we were contracted for parts and services related to enhancing and supporting these two WASP systems owned and operated by the SMDC. The upgrades and services were designed to expand the payload weight capability of the WASP systems in order to integrate specialized wireless electronics, advanced optics and a communication package provided by L-3 Communications Systems-West. 

In June 2015, we formed a working group with L-3 CS-West to form a technical integration plan of their technology into the WASP and jointly market the integrated solutions. The group will focus on upgrading the WASP system through the integration of electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) imaging tactical surveillance system coupled to an L-3 CS-West communications package, which will provide secure high-definition video imagery to ground-based devices such as L-3&#8217;s Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER). 

&#160; &#9744; In August 2015, we provided the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with customized winch systems and related equipment for use at the Agency&#8217;s National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) as part of the EQA&#8217;s on-going emission sampling program utilizing tethered aerostats. 

&#160; &#9744; In October 2015, we provided two customized WASP systems to specialized defense contractor Troll Systems, jointly working with Troll to integrate the L-3 Wescam MX-10 advanced optical sensor system into the WASP platform for an international customer.
