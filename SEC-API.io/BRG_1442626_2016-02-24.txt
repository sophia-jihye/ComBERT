Organization 

&#160;

Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on July 25, 2008 under the laws of the state of Maryland.

&#160;

We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a real estate investment trust (or &#8220;REIT&#8221;) for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our &#8220;REIT taxable income,&#8221; as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. We were incorporated to raise capital and acquire a diverse portfolio of residential real estate assets.

&#160;

We have no employees and are supported by a related-party service agreement with BRG Manager, LLC (the &#8220;Manager), a Delaware limited liability company organized in 2014. We are externally managed by the Manager, which manages our day-to-day operations under a Management Agreement. Our Management Agreement has a three-year term expiring April 2, 2017, and will be automatically renewed for a one-year term each year on April 2, unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement. The Manager is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making real estate investments on our behalf. Substantially all our business is conducted through our operating partnership, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (our &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;).

&#160;

The principal executive offices of our Company and the Manager are located at 712 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019. Our telephone number is (212) 843-1601.

&#160;

Investments in Real Estate 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of interests in twenty properties (fourteen operating and six development properties). The twenty properties contain an aggregate of 6,449 units, comprised of 4,625 operating units and 1,824 units under development. As of December 31, 2015, our stabilized properties, exclusive of our development properties, and Whetstone, EOS and Sorrell, our lease-up properties, were approximately 93% occupied. For more information regarding our investments, see &#34;Item 2. Properties&#34;.

&#160;

Business and Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

Our principal business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted investment returns by assembling a high-quality portfolio of apartment properties located in demographically attractive growth markets and by implementing our investment strategies and our Live/Work/Play Initiatives to achieve sustainable long-term growth in both our funds from operations and net asset value.

&#160;

Invest in Institutional-Quality Apartment Properties. We acquire institutional-quality apartment properties where we believe we can create long-term value for our stockholders utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies.

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Core-Plus . We invest in institutional-quality apartment properties with strong and stable cash flows in target markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and with potential for further value creation. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Value-Add . We invest in well-located apartment properties that offer significant potential for medium-term capital appreciation through repositioning, renovation or redevelopment, to reposition the asset and drive future rental growth. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Opportunistic . We invest in properties available at opportunistic prices (i.e., at prices we believe are below those available in an otherwise efficient market) that exhibit some characteristics of distress, such as operational inefficiencies, significant deferred capital maintenance or broken capital structures providing an opportunity for a substantial portion of total return attributable to appreciation in value. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Invest-to-Own . We selectively invest in development of Class A properties in target markets where we believe we can capture significant development premiums upon completion. We generally use a convertible loan or convertible preferred equity structure which provides income during the development stage, while providing us the ability to capture development premiums at completion by exercising our conversion rights to take ownership. &#160;

Invest in Class A Apartment Properties. We intend to continue to acquire primarily Class A apartment properties targeting the high disposable income renter by choice, where we believe we can create long-term value growth for our stockholders.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Focus on Growth Markets. We intend to continue to focus on demographically attractive growth markets, which we define as markets with strong employment drivers in industries creating high disposable income jobs over the long term. Employment growth is highly correlated with apartment demand; therefore, we believe that selecting markets with job growth significantly above the national average will provide high potential for increase rental demand leading to revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns.

&#160;

Implement our Value Creation Strategies. We intend to continue to focus on creating value at our properties utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies in order to maximize our return on investment. Our Manager will work with each member of our Partner Network to evaluate property needs along with value-creation opportunities and create an asset-specific business plan to best position or reposition each property to drive rental growth and asset values. Our Manager then provides an aggressive asset management presence to manage our Partner and ensure execution of the plan, with the goal of driving rental growth and values.

&#160;

Implement our Live/Work/Play Initiatives. We intend to continue to implement our amenities and attributes to transform the apartment community from a purely functional product (i.e., as solely a place to live), to a lifestyle product (i.e., as a place to live, interact, and socialize). Our Live/Work/Play initiatives are property specific, and generally consist of attributes that go beyond traditional features, including highly amenitized common areas, cosmetic and architectural improvements, technology, music and other community-oriented activities to appeal to our residents&#8217; desire for a &#8220;sense of community&#8221; by creating places to gather, socialize and interact in an amenity-rich environment. We believe this creates an enhanced perception of value among residents, allowing for premium rental rates and improved resident retention.

&#160;

Diversify Across Markets, Strategies and Investment Size. We will seek to grow our high-quality portfolio of apartment properties diversified by geography and by investment strategy and by size (typically ranging from $25 to $75 million) in order to manage concentration risk, while driving both current income and capital appreciation throughout the portfolio. Our Partner Network enables us to diversify across multiple markets and multiple strategies efficiently, without the logistical burden and time delay of building operating infrastructure in multiple markets and across multiple investment strategies.

&#160;

Selectively Harvest and Redeploy Capital. On an opportunistic basis and subject to compliance with certain REIT restrictions, we intend to sell properties in cases where we have successfully executed our value creation plans and where we believe the investment has limited additional upside relative to other opportunities, in order to harvest profits and to reinvest proceeds to maximize stockholder value. 

&#160; 

Our IPO and Listing 

&#160; &#160;

In late 2013, following our continuous registered offerings as a non-listed REIT (our &#8220;Continuous Registered Offerings&#8221;), our board decided to register shares of newly authorized Class A common stock that were to be offered in a firmly underwritten public offering (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) by filing a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-192610) with the SEC, on November 27, 2013. On March 28, 2014, the SEC declared the registration statement effective and we announced the pricing of the IPO of 3,448,276 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $14.50 per share for total gross proceeds of $50.0 million. The net proceeds of the IPO were approximately $44.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.

&#160;

In connection with the IPO, shares of our Class A common stock were listed on the NYSE MKT for trading under the symbol &#8220;BRG.&#8221; Pursuant to the second articles of amendment and restatement to our charter filed on March 26, 2014 (&#8220;the Second Charter Agreement&#8221;), each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the listing, including shares sold in our Continuous Registered Offerings, was changed into one-third of a share of each of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock. Following the filing of the Second Charter Amendment, we effected a 2.264881-to-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock, and on March 31, 2014, we effected an additional 1.0045878-to-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock.

&#160;

Subsequent Capital Raising Events 

&#160;

In October 2014, we completed an underwritten follow-on offering (the &#8220;October 2014 Follow-On Offering&#8221;) of 3,035,444 shares of Class A common stock, inclusive of shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters, on October 8, 2014. Net proceeds of the October 2014 Follow-On Offering were approximately $32.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. 

&#160;

In January 2015, we completed an underwritten shelf takedown offering (the &#8220;January 2015 Follow-On Offering&#8221;) from our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200359)(the &#8220;December 2014 Shelf Registration Statement&#8221;) of 4,600,000 shares of Class A common stock, inclusive of shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters, on January 20, 2015. Net proceeds of the January 2015 Follow-On Offering were approximately $53.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs. 

&#160;

On May 22, 2015, we completed an underwritten shelf takedown offering (the &#8220;May 2015 Follow-On Offering&#8221;) of 6,348,000 shares of Class A common stock, inclusive of shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters. Net proceeds of the May 2015 Follow-On Offering were approximately $77.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.

&#160;

On October 21, 2015, we completed an underwritten shelf takedown offering (the &#8220;October 2015 Preferred Stock Offering&#8221;) of 2,875,000 shares of 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;), par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $25.00 per share, inclusive of shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters. Net proceeds of the October 2015 Preferred Stock Offering were approximately $69.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Together, the January 2015 Follow-On Offering, the May 2015 Follow-On Offering and the October 2015 Preferred Stock Offering are referred to as the 2015 Follow-On Offerings. The October 2014 Follow-On Offering, together with the 2015 Follow-On Offerings, are referred to as the Follow-On Offerings.

&#160;

On December 17, 2015, we filed a prospectus supplement to the December 2014 Shelf Registration Statement offering a maximum of 150,000 Units (the &#8220;Original Units&#8221;) consisting of 150,000 shares of Series B redeemable preferred stock (the &#8220;Original Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;) and warrants (the &#8220;Original Warrants&#8221;) to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (liquidation preference $1,000 per share of Original Series B Preferred Stock). On February 22, 2016, our board of directors authorized the termination of the offering of the Original Series B Preferred Stock in order to revise certain terms thereof, and the reclassification of the Original Series B Preferred Stock. On February 23, 2016, we terminated the offering of the Original Series B Preferred Stock, and on February 24, 2016, we filed a new prospectus supplement to the December 2014 Shelf Registration Statement offering a maximum of 150,000 Units (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) consisting of 150,000 shares of the reclassified Series B redeemable preferred stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;) and warrants (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;) to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (liquidation preference $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock). As of February 24, 2016, we were continuing to organize our sales activities for the Series B Preferred Stock and no Units had been sold.

&#160;

&#160;

In conjunction with the completion of the IPO in 2014, we completed a series of related contribution transactions pursuant to which we acquired interests in five apartment properties for an aggregate asset value of $152.3 million (inclusive of Villas at Oak Crest, which is accounted for under the equity method, and Springhouse, in which we already owned an interest and which has been reported as consolidated for the periods presented).

Distribution Policy 

&#160;

We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain, and imposes tax on any taxable income retained by a REIT, including capital gains.

&#160;

To satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to federal income and excise tax, we intend to continue to make regular monthly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to dividends paid, to our stockholders out of assets legally available for such purposes. All future distributions will be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors on a quarterly basis. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our board of directors will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future operating cash flows, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for acquisitions of new properties, general property capital improvements and debt repayments, (iv) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (v) the requirements of Maryland law, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay and (vii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our credit or other agreements.

&#160;

Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from and including the date of original issue or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5 th , April 5 th , July 5 th and October 5 th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2016. From the date of original issue (or from the date of issue of any Series A Preferred Stock issued after October 21, 2015) to, but not including, October 21, 2022, we will pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 8.250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $2.0625 per share). Commencing October 21, 2022, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%.

&#160;

Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of legally available funds, cumulative cash dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock at an annual rate of six percent (6%) of the initial stated value of $1,000 per share (the &#8220;Stated Value&#8221;). Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock will begin accruing on, and will be cumulative from, the date of issuance or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid, payable monthly in arrears on the 5 th day of each month to holders of record on the 25 th day of the prior month. 

&#160;

We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders, or that we will be able to sustain those distributions. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, offering proceeds, borrow funds, sell assets, make a taxable distribution of our equity or debt securities, or reduce such distributions. Our distribution policy enables us to review the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, please see &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160;

Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Environmental 

&#160;

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.

&#160; 

Industry Segment 

&#160;

Our current business consists of investing in and operating multifamily communities. A significant portion of our consolidated net income (loss) is from investments in real estate properties that we own through joint ventures. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment.

&#160;
