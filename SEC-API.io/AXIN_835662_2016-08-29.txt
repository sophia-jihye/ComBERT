Company History 

&#160; 

The registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on December 30, 1987. From 1987 until early in 1990, the registrant was engaged in the business of providing educational products, counseling, seminar programs, and publications such as newsletters to adults aged 30 to 50. The registrant financed its business with private offerings of securities, obtaining shareholder loans, and with an underwritten initial public offering of securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). The registrant registered its common stock with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) during 1988. The registrant&#8217;s business failed in early 1990. The registrant ceased all operating activities during the period from June 1, 1990 to August 31, 2001 and was considered dormant. During this period that the registrant was dormant, the registrant did not file required reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

During 2001, the registrant was reactivated with a business plan of filing all delinquent documents with the Colorado Secretary of State, the SEC, and federal and state tax authorities; and sought to merge with another company which had assets and an active business. The registrant has filed all of such delinquent documents with the Colorado Secretary of State and the federal and state tax authorities, and all reports required under the Exchange Act since 2002 and is now current in reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

During August of 2004, the registrant&#8217;s shareholders approved a plan of quasi-reorganization pursuant to which accounts were restated to eliminate the accumulated deficit and related capital accounts on the registrant&#8217;s balance sheet. This quasi-reorganization was effective on March 1, 2004. On August 3, 2004, the registrant effected a 900-for-1 reverse stock split; and on June 2, 2009, the registrant effected a 3.5-for-1 reverse stock split. All references to the registrant&#8217;s common stock in this Form have been restated to reflect these reverse stock splits. 

&#160; 

On November 9, 2009, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Stock Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Algodon Wines &#38; Luxury Development Group, Inc. or &#8220;AWLD&#8221; (formerly Diversified Private Equity Corporation or &#8220;DPEC&#8221;), a privately-held Delaware corporation, and Kanouff, LLC (&#8220;KLLC&#8221;) and Underwood Family Partners, Ltd. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), of which KLLC and the Partnership were the majority shareholders of the Company (the &#8220;Stock Purchase&#8221;). In connection with the Stock Purchase, AWLD purchased and the Company sold, an aggregate of 43,822,001 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $43,822, or $0.001 per share. In addition, AWLD purchased 200 shares of common stock from KLLC and 200 shares of common stock from the Partnership for a purchase price of $180,000 payable to each selling shareholder, of which $105,000 was paid at closing and $75,000 had previously been paid in connection with a letter of intent and related amendments. 

&#160; 

As of August 29, 2016, there were 45,411,400 shares of the registrant&#8217;s common stock outstanding. 

&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

During each of the years since the registrant was reactivated, the registrant has had no revenue and has had losses approximately equal to the expenditures required to reactivate and comply with filing and reporting obligations. The registrant does not expect any revenue unless and until a business acquisition transaction is completed. Expenditures have been paid by the registrant from capital contributions and loans made to the registrant by entities controlled by the registrant&#8217;s directors. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

On November 9, 2009, we entered into and closed the Stock Purchase Agreement with AWLD, KLLC, and the Partnership. Immediately prior to closing, KLLC and the Partnership were the majority shareholders of the Company, and the Stock Purchase resulted in a change in control of the Company. AWLD is headquartered in New York, NY, and is a virtually integrated company that creates, develops, markets, sells and manages private equity investment opportunities, formerly in the biotechnology industry and currently in non-leveraged global real estate assets located in Argentina. In connection with the Stock Purchase, AWLD purchased, and the Company sold, an aggregate of 43,822,001 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $43,822, or $0.001 per share. In addition, AWLD purchased 200 shares of common stock from KLLC and 200 shares of common stock from the Partnership for a purchase price of $180,000 payable to each selling shareholder, of which $105,000 was paid at closing and $75,000 was previously paid in connection with a letter of intent and related amendments. Immediately following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, there were 45,411,400 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Immediately following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, AWLD owned an aggregate of 43,822,401 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock out of the total of 45,411,400 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the closing, or approximately 96.5% of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares. 

&#160; 

The Stock Purchase Agreement contained post-closing covenants whereby Mercari and AWLD agreed to utilize their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Mercari to (i) remain a Section 12(g) reporting company in compliance with and current in its reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; and (ii) cause all of the assets and business or equity interest of AWLD, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies to be transferred to Mercari and, in connection with such transactions, cause Mercari&#8217;s stock to be distributed by AWLD to AWLD&#8217;s stockholders and the holders of equity interests in the affiliated companies (&#8220;Reorganization Transaction&#8221;). 

&#160; 

AWLD&#8217;s Board of Directors determined that a Reorganization Transaction was no longer commercially reasonable, taking into account all relevant material factors, including without limitation, current economic, financial and market conditions. 

&#160; 

On April 2, 2014, Tim F. Holderbaum submitted his resignation as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company to be effective on May 19, 2014. On April 2, 2014, the Company accepted Mr. Holderbaum&#8217;s resignation as Secretary and Treasurer. On April 16, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mark G. Downey as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, to be effective May 19, 2014. 

&#160; 

On April 11, 2015, Mark G. Downey was terminated as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of Company effective immediately. Mr. Downey&#8217;s termination was primarily based on the Company&#8217;s effort to reduce expenses and reconfigure staff, and not as the result of any disagreement with the Company practices or policies. On April 13, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Maria Echevarria as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, effective immediately.
