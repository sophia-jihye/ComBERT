In 2015 , the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries provided various support functions to the Company&#8217;s retail operations on an integrated, company-wide basis. 

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s bank subsidiary, FDS Bank, provides credit processing, certain collections, customer service and credit marketing services in respect of all credit card accounts that are owned either by Department Stores National Bank (&#8220;DSNB&#8221;), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A., or FDS Bank and that constitute a part of the credit programs of the Company&#8217;s retail operations. 

&#8226; 

Macy&#8217;s Systems and Technology, Inc. (&#8220;MST&#8221;), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, provides operational electronic data processing and management information services to all of the Company&#8217;s operations other than Bluemercury. 

&#8226; 

Macy&#8217;s Merchandising Group, Inc. (&#8220;MMG&#8221;), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiary Macy's Merchandising Group International, LLC., are responsible for the design, development and marketing of Macy&#8217;s private label brands and certain licensed brands. Bloomingdale&#8217;s uses MMG for a small portion of its private label merchandise. The Company believes that its private label merchandise further differentiates its merchandise assortments from those of its competitors and delivers exceptional value to its customers. MMG also offers its services, either directly or indirectly, to unrelated third parties. 

The principal private label brands currently offered by the Company include Alfani, American Rag, Aqua, Bar III, Belgique, Charter Club, Club Room, Epic Threads, first impressions, Giani Bernini, Greg Norman for Tasso Elba, Home Design, Hotel Collection, Hudson Park, Ideology, I-N-C, jenni, JM Collection, John Ashford, Karen Scott, Maison Jules, Martha Stewart Collection, Material Girl, Morgan Taylor, Studio Silver, Style &#38; Co., Sutton Studio, Tasso Elba, Thalia Sodi, the cellar, and Tools of the Trade.

Macy&#8217;s Logistics and Operations (&#8220;Macy&#8217;s Logistics&#8221;), a division of a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, provides warehousing and merchandise distribution services for the Company&#8217;s operations and digital customer fulfillment.

Employees &#32; 

As of January 30, 2016 , the Company had approximately 157,900 regular full-time and part-time employees. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of employees peaks in the holiday season. Approximately 10% of the Company&#8217;s employees as of January 30, 2016 &#32;were represented by unions. Management considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. 

Seasonality &#32; 

The retail business is seasonal in nature with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in the months of November and December. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing in mid-summer in anticipation of the fall merchandising season and increasing substantially prior to the holiday season when the Company carries significantly higher inventory levels. 

Purchasing 

The Company purchases merchandise from many suppliers, no one of which accounted for more than 5% of the Company&#8217;s net purchases during 2015 . The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company considers its relations with its suppliers to be satisfactory. 

Competition 

The retailing industry is intensely competitive. The Company&#8217;s operations compete with many retailing formats, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers&#8217; outlets, online retailers, mail order catalogs and television shopping, among others. The retailers with which the Company competes include Amazon, Bed Bath &#38; Beyond, Belk, Bon Ton, Burlington Coat Factory, Dillard&#8217;s, Gap, J.C. Penney, Kohl&#8217;s, L Brands, Lord &#38; Taylor, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Ross Stores, Saks, Sears, Target, TJ Maxx and Wal-Mart. The Company seeks to attract customers by offering superior selections, obvious value, and distinctive marketing in stores that are located in premier locations, and by providing an exciting shopping environment and superior service through an omnichannel experience. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these bases, or on other bases, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences.
