 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions for the way employees communicate in business. We believe that our innovative, cloud-based approach disrupts the large market for business communications solutions by providing flexible and cost-effective services that support distributed workforces, mobile employees and the proliferation of &#8220;bring-your-own&#8221; communications devices. We enable our customers to have a more productive and dynamic workforce by providing convenient and effective communications, across all their locations, all their employees, and all their devices. 

Traditionally, business communications is comprised of a series of inflexible, expensive, and disparate systems: on-premise hardware based private branch exchanges, or PBX systems, which are still prevalent in businesses today. The emergence of the cloud and the SaaS business model, combined with the proliferation of smart phones and tablets as well as the corresponding new paradigms in user experiences, is enabling a revolution in how people communicate. We believe RingCentral is poised to benefit from this structural shift. RingCentral&#8217;s software cloud communications platform is designed from the ground-up, specifically for today&#8217;s dispersed and mobile workforce. We unify the way employees communicate through mobile and desktop devices, text messaging, audio, video and web conferencing as well as collaborating on projects with document sharing and team messaging from a single, easy-to-use carrier-grade SaaS platform. Further, through our development of application programming interfaces (API&#8217;s), we are integrating our platform with other cloud solutions to better reflect the way we work today. By providing these capabilities in a single platform, we also substantially reduce the time to implement and total cost of ownership for our customers.

We primarily generate revenues from software subscriptions for our cloud-based services. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through adding additional users, upselling current customers to premium subscription editions, and providing additional features and functionality. We market and sell our subscriptions directly, through both our website and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through a network of over 2,500 sales agents and resellers, including AT&#38;T, which we refer to collectively as resellers. In addition, TELUS Communications Company, or TELUS, is a reseller of our cloud solutions in Canada and British Telecom, or BT, is a reseller of our cloud solutions in the United Kingdom. 

Our Solutions 

Our cloud-based business communications solutions provide a single user identity across multiple locations and devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, and allow for communication across multiple channels, including voice, text, team messaging collaboration, HD video for web conferencing and fax. Our proprietary solutions enable a more productive and dynamic workforce, and are architected using industry standards to meet modern business communications requirements, including workforce mobility, &#8220;bring-your-own&#8221; communications device environments and multiple communications methods. 

Our solutions are delivered using a highly availability and scalable infrastructure, and are generally designed for easy self-service activation, provisioning and management with minimal technical expertise or training required. Our solutions scale easily and rapidly, allowing our customers to add new users regardless of where they are located. They are generally affordable, requiring little to no upfront infrastructure hardware costs or ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs commonly associated with on-premise systems and can be integrated with other existing communication systems. RingCentral Office, our flagship offering, is a multi-user, enterprise-grade communications solution. We also offer RingCentral Professional, primarily an inbound call routing subscription with additional text and fax capabilities targeting smaller deployments, and RingCentral Fax, an Internet fax subscription that permits sending and receiving faxes over the Internet. 

We believe that our solutions go beyond the core functionality of existing on-premise communications solutions by providing additional key benefits that address the changing requirements of business to allow business communications using voice, SMS, team messaging, collaboration, fax and HD video web conferencing. The key benefits of our solutions include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Location Independence. Our cloud-based solution is designed to be location independent. We seamlessly connect distributed and mobile users, enabling employees to communicate with a single identity whether working from a central location, a branch office, on the road, or at home. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Device Independence. Our solution is designed to work with a broad range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, enabling businesses to successfully implement a &#8220;bring-your-own&#8221; communications device strategy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Instant Activation; Easy Account Management. Our solutions are designed for rapid deployment and ease of management. Our simple and intuitive graphical user interfaces allow administrators and users to set up and manage their business communications system with little or no IT expertise, training or dedicated staffing. Our solutions work with users&#8217; existing smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones. Additionally, if a customer desires new desk phones, as a convenience, we can also provide pre-configured, Plug&#38;Ring-ready phones that can be easily connected to the customer&#8217;s existing broadband service. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Scalability. Our cloud-based solutions scale easily and efficiently with the growth of our customers. Customers can add use rs, regardless of their location, without having to purchase additional infrastructure hardware or software upgrades. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Lower Cost of Ownership. We believe that our customers experience significantly lower cost of ownership compared to legacy on-premise systems. Using our cloud-based solutions, our customers can avoid the significant upfront costs of infrastructure hardware, software, ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs, and the need for dedicated and trained IT personnel to support these systems. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Seamless and Intuitive Integration with Other Cloud-Based Applications. &#160; Cloud-based applications are proliferating within businesses of all sizes. Integration of these cloud-based business applications with legacy on-premise systems is typically complex and expensive, which limits the ability of businesses to leverage cloud-based applications. Our platform provides seamless and intuitive integration with multiple popular cloud-based business applications such as Office365, Google For Work, Salesforce CRM and Zendesk. 

Our Products 

We currently offer five products: RingCentral Office, RingCentral Professional, RingCentral Fax, RingCentral Contact Center, and Glip by RingCentral. 

&#160;

RingCentral Office. &#160; RingCentral Office, our flagship product, is a multi-location, multi-user, enterprise-grade communications solution that enables employees to communicate via different channels and on multiple devices. This subscription is designed primarily for businesses that require a communications solution, regardless of location, type of device, expertise, size or budget. Businesses are able to seamlessly connect users working in multiple office locations on smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones. We sell RingCentral Office in three editions: Standard, Premium and Enterprise. Our Standard Edition of RingCentral Office includes call management, mobile applications, voice, business SMS, team messaging and collaboration, business analytics and reporting, audio, video, and web conferencing capabilities, and integration with other cloud-based business applications such as Box, Dropbox, Google for Work and Microsoft Office365 and Outlook. Our Premium and Enterprise Editions include the Standard Edition functionality together with additional software integrations with other cloud-based business applications such as Salesforce CRM, Zendesk and Desk.com, high-definition voice, more advanced call routing for our larger customers with multiple business units, and automatic call recording. All editions also vary in the number of included toll-free minutes and number of concurrent video and web conference meeting attendees. RingCentral Office customers also have available to them RingCentral Global Office. 

Key features of RingCentral Office include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cloud-Based Business Communications Solutions. We offer multi-user, multi-extension, cloud-based business communications solutions that do not require installation, configuration, management or maintenance of on-premise hardware and software. Our solutions are instantly activated, and deliver a rich set of functionality across multiple locations and devices. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mobile-Centric Approach. &#160; Our solution includes smartphone and tablet mobile applications that customers can use to set up and manage company, department and user settings from anywhere. Our applications turn iOS and Android smartphones and tablets into business communication devices. Users can change their personal settings instantly and communicate via voice, text, team messaging and collaboration, HD video and web conferencing and fax. Personal mobile devices are fully integrated into the customer&#8217;s cloud-based communication solution, using the company&#8217;s numbers, and displaying one of the company&#8217;s caller ID for calls made through our mobile applications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Easy Set-Up and Control. Our user interfaces have a familiar smartphone touch-screen &#8220;look and feel&#8221; and provide a consistent user experience across smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, making it intuitive and easy for our customers to quickly discover and use our solution across devices. Among other capabilities, administrators can specify and modify company, department, user settings, auto-receptionist settings, call-handling, and routing rules; and add, change, and customize users and departments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Flexible Call Routing. Our solution includes an auto-attendant to easily customize call routing for the entire company, departments, groups, or individual employees. It includes a robust suite of communication management options, including time of day, caller ID, and call queuing, and sophisticated routing rules for complex call handling for the company, departments, groups and individual employees. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Integrated Voice, Text, HD Video and Web Conferencing, and Fax Communications with One Business Number. By eliminating the need for multiple business numbers, users are able to easily control how, when, and where they conduct their business communications through routing logic with one number. Employees can stay connected, thus increasing efficiency, productivity and responsiveness to their customers. Having one business number also enables users to keep personal mobile numbers private. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Cloud-based Business Application Integrations. Our solution seamlessly integrates with other cloud-based business applications such as Salesforce CRM, Google for Work, Box, Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365, Desk.com, and Zendesk. For example, integration with Salesforce CRM brings up customer records immediately based on inbound caller IDs, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency . Additionally, users can easily fax documents directly from their cloud-based storage accounts. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

RingCentral Global Office. Our solution includes RingCentral Global Office, a single global Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solution designed for multinational enterprises that allows these companies to support distributed offices and employees globally with a single cloud solution. With RingCentral Global Office, multinational enterprises can appear local for their regional customers while also acting as one integrated business, with capabilities including local phone numbers, local caller ID, worldwide extension-to-extension dialing, and included minute bundles for international calling. 

RingCentral Professional. Our RingCentral Professional solution provides a subset of our RingCentral Office solution capabilities designed primarily for smaller businesses. RingCentral Professional is principally used as an inbound call routing subscription with text and fax capabilities. 

RingCentral Fax. Our RingCentral Fax solution provides Internet fax capabilities that allow businesses to send and receive fax documents without the need for a fax machine. 

RingCentral Contact Center. &#160; Our RingCentral Contact Center solution provides a cloud based contact center solution that delivers multi-channel capabilities so businesses can allow customers to engage in the manner they prefer. The solution leverages technology from InContact, and has a comprehensive feature set that integrates with RingCentral Office. This enables businesses to be more engaged, and resolve customer issues faster and more effectively. 

Glip by RingCentral. Our Glip by RingCentral team messaging and collaboration solution allows diverse teams to stay connected through multiple modes of communication through an integration with RingCentral Office. In addition to using Glip for team messaging and communications, teams can share tasks, notes, group calendars, and files. Glip is designed for distributed and mobile teams and offers integrations with a number of leading cloud business applications such as Asana, Dropbox, Evernote, JIRA, Github, Google and others. 

Our Customers 

We have a diverse and growing customer base across a wide range of industries, including advertising, consulting, finance, healthcare, legal, real estate, retail and technology. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, AT&#38;T, one of our resellers, accounted for 13% and 12% of our total revenues and 12% and 11% of our software subscription revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, no single customer or reseller accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Traditionally, we have focused our principal efforts on the market for small- and medium-sized businesses, defined by IDC as less than 1,000 employees, in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. In 2014 we began targeting larger customers through our product development and marketing, and sales and support teams, and we will continue to do so in the future. We believe that there are additional growth opportunities in international markets. 

Marketing, Sales and Support 

We use a variety of marketing, sales and support activities to generate and cultivate ongoing customer demand for our subscriptions, acquire new customers, and engage with our existing customers. We sell through both direct and indirect channels. We provide on-boarding implementation support to help our customers set up and configure their newly purchased communications system, as well as ongoing self-service, phone support, online chat support, and training. We also closely track and monitor customer acquisition costs to assess how we are deploying our marketing, sales, and customer support spending. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Marketing. Our marketing efforts include search engine marketing, search engine optimization, affiliates, list buys, shared leads, content leads, appointment setting, radio advertising, online display advertising, billboard advertising, tradeshows and events, and other forms of demand generation. We track and measure our marketing costs closely across all channels so that we can acquire customers in a cost-efficient manner. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Direct Sales. We primarily sell our products and software subscriptions through direct inbound and outbound sales efforts. We have direct sales representatives located in the U.S. and internationally. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Indirect Sales. Our indirect sales channel consists of a network of over 2,500 resellers, including AT&#38;T, TELUS, and BT which help broaden the adoption of our subscriptions without the need for a large direct field sales force. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer Support. While our intuitive and easy-to-use user interface serves to reduce our customers&#8217; need for support, we provide online chat and phone customer support, as well as post-sale implementation support, as an option to help 

&#160;

&#160;

customers configure and use our solution. We track and measure our customer satisfaction and our support costs closely across all channels to provide a high level of customer service in a cost-efficient manner. &#160;

Research and Development 

We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to expanding our leadership position within the cloud-based business communications solutions market. We devote the majority of our research and development resources to software development. Our engineering team has significant experience in various disciplines related to our platform, such as, voice, text, team messaging and collaboration, video and fax processing, mobile application development, IP networking and infrastructure, user experience, security, and robust multi-tenant cloud-based system architecture. 

Our development methodology, in combination with our SaaS delivery model, allows us to provide new and enhanced capabilities on a regular basis. Based on feedback from our customers and prospects and our review of the broader business communications and SaaS markets, we continuously develop new functionality while maintaining and enhancing our existing solution. 

Our research and development expenses were $52.9 million, $44.6 million and $33.4 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Technology and Operations 

Our platform is built on a highly scalable and flexible infrastructure comprised of commercially available hardware and software components. We believe that both hardware and software components of our platform can be replaced, upgraded or added with minimal or no interruption in service. The system is designed to have no single point-of-failure. 

We host our products and serve our customers in North America from two third-party U.S. based data center facilities in San Jose, California and Vienna, Virginia, and we host our products and serve our customers in the United Kingdom from two third-party data center facilities in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Zurich, Switzerland. Our data centers are designed to host mission-critical computer and communications systems with redundant, fault-tolerant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We maintain a security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to our customers&#8217; data. We limit access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. 

We serve North American customers out of two Points of Presence, known as POPs, one in San Jose, California and the other in Vienna, Virginia. RingCentral subscribers are divided into Parts of Data, or PODs, each comprised of two symmetrical, synchronized units. POPs and PODs are redundant with switchover and failover capabilities between POPs. This architecture enables us to deliver our subscriptions in a scalable and reliable manner. We can manage our customer growth by adding additional PODs and POPs into our delivery infrastructure as required. We leverage third-party network service providers, including Level 3 Communications, Inc., Bandwidth.com, Inc., Novatel Wireless, Inc. and AT&#38;T Inc., for network connectivity. We also obtain connectivity and network services in certain regions from our subsidiary, RCLEC, Inc. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 

Our intellectual property portfolio includes 85 issued U.S. patents, which expire between 2026 and 2035. We also have 49 patent applications pending for examination in the U.S. and 17 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are related to U.S. applications. In general our patents and patent applications apply to certain aspects of our SaaS and mobile applications and underlying communications infrastructure. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and software subscriptions. 

&#160;

Competition 

The market for business communications solutions is very large, rapidly evolving, complex, fragmented and defined by changing technology and customer needs. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

subscription features and capabilities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

system reliability, availability and performance; 

&#160;

&#183; 

speed and ease of activation, setup and configuration; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ownership and control of the underlying technology; 

&#160;

&#183; 

integration with mobile devices; 

&#160;

&#183; 

brand awareness and recognition; 

&#160;

&#183; 

simplicity of the pricing model; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

total cost of ownership. 

We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. 

We face competition from a broad range of providers of business communications solutions. Some of these competitors include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Alcatel-Lucent, S.A., Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel Networks Corporation, ShoreTel, Inc., and Siemens Enterprise Networks, LLC, any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud; 

&#160;

&#183; 

software providers such as Microsoft Corporation and Broadsoft, Inc. that generally license their software and may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud, and their resellers including major carriers and cable companies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

established communications providers that resell on-premise hardware, software and hosted solutions, such as AT&#38;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., and Comcast Corporation in the United States, TELUS and others in Canada, and BT and others in the U.K., , all of whom have significantly greater resources than us and do now or may in the future also develop and/or host their own or other solutions through the cloud; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

other cloud companies such as j2 Global, Inc., 8x8, Inc., Intermedia.net, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., Nextiva, Inc., Fuze (formerly Thinking Phone Networks), and Jive Communications, Inc. 

Employees and Contractors

As of December 31, 2015, we had 759 full-time employees, including 209 in research and development, 319 in sales and marketing, 64 in operations, 51 in customer technical support, and 116 in general and administrative. As of such date, we had 601 employees located in the U.S. and 158 internationally, including 124 in China . None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good and we have never experienced any work stoppages. 

&#160;

We also contract with third-party contractors whose employees or subcontractors&#8217; employees perform services for us. We refer to our third-party contractors&#8217; employees and subcontractors&#8217; employees as our contractors. As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,349 of these contractors, including 346 in research and development, 89 in operations, 357 in sales and marketing, 421 in customer technical support, and 136 in general and administrative. As of such date, we had 60 contractors located in the U.S. and 1,289 internationally, including 803 in the Philippines, 463 in Russia and Ukraine, and 23 in other countries. 

Regulatory 

As a provider of Internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund, and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. In addition, we have certified a wholly owned subsidiary as a competitive local exchange carrier in eighteen states and currently intend to obtain certificates for our subsidiary in several additional states. This subsidiary, RCLEC, is subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commissions in states where the subsidiary provides services. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement for our subsidiary to register or seek 

&#160;

certification to provide its services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements. 

As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our subscriptions. Regulatory treatment of Internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our subscriptions in the U.S. In the United Kingdom, for example, our subscriptions are regulated by Ofcom, which, among other things, requires electronic communications providers such as our company to provide all users access to both 112 (EU-mandated) and 999 (U.K.-mandated) emergency service numbers at no charge. Similarly in Canada, our subscriptions are regulated by the CRTC, which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the wireline incumbent carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on the use of our subscriptions in international locations. See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for more information.
