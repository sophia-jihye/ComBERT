History and Development of the Company 

&#160; 

2050 Motors, Inc. has an exclusive license, subject to minimum sales requirements, to import, market and sell in the United States, Puerto Rico, the US Territories and Peru, the &#8220;e-Go&#8221; lightweight carbon fiber all-electric vehicle design and electric light truck, manufactured by Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Aoxin Automobile&#8221;) located in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;). Aoxin Automobile was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Corporation (&#8220;Dongfeng Motor&#8221;), which is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in China, producing over 3.76 million cars and trucks in 2012. Aoxin Automobile was funded by Dongfeng Motor to develop and manufacture a lightweight, super-efficient, carbon fiber e-Go EV electric car (&#8220;e-Go EV&#8221;). Dongfeng Motor, over a five year period, invested a substantial amount of money to develop with the support of Italian engineers a new carbon fiber technology to produce carbon fiber parts at a significantly reduced cost. They also developed a lightweight aluminum racing frame to ultimately create the ultralight weight electric automobile known as the e-Go. 

&#160; 

In 2014, Yancheng Municipal State-Owned Asset Investment Group, Co. Ltd. (YMSIG), an investment and property development company founded by the Yancheng Municipal Government, purchased Aoxin Automobile from Dongfeng Motor, Co. Ltd. YMSIG has made major investments in Aoxin, which funded on a fast track schedule the completion of the e-Go automobile manufacturing facility that culminated in a grand opening ceremony on January 20, 2015. 

&#160; 

The e-Go EV is a unique lightweight carbon fiber electric vehicle built on an aluminum frame. It will be the only production line electric vehicle with a carbon fiber body manufactured by a new process that uses robotics to produce parts, which significantly reduces the production time and cost of carbon fiber components. The carbon fiber composite material is five times stronger than steel, and one third the weight. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the exclusive license agreement signed with Aoxin Automobile, in order to maintain exclusive rights for the United States (USA), the Company is required to purchase and sell a certain amount of e-Go EV model vehicles per year for a certain period of time starting from the completion of the requirements established by the United States Department of Transportation&#8217;s (US DOT) protocols for the e-Go EV model. The required amount of vehicles that the company needs to sell per year are as follows: Year one-2,000 vehicles; Year 2-6,000 vehicles; Year 3-12,000 vehicles; Year 4-24,000 vehicles and Year 5-48,000 vehicles.

&#160; 

The exclusive license contract between 2050 Motors and Aoxin Automobile requires that 2050 Motors complete US crash testing according to US Department of Transportation (&#8220;US DOT&#8221;) safety standards. 2050 Motors has entered into negotiations with the Calspan Corporation (&#8220;Calspan&#8221;). Calspan is committed to the evolution of safety in the air and on the ground, and has assisted in developing new aircraft; training world-class test pilots; performing ground-breaking automobile accident research; and contributing to safety innovations on the ground and in the air over its 70-year history. Calspan has performed over 40,000 sled test operations for aircraft and 2,500 full-scale crash tests conducted on behalf of the US DOT. 

&#160; 

Two demonstration vehicles were received from Aoxin in the fourth quarter of 2015. One of the demonstration vehicles was showcased to the American public at the William Carr Gallery in Las Vegas, Nevada. This vehicle will remain for public viewing at the gallery until April 30, 2016. 2050 Motors intends to eventually crash test eight (8) e-Go EV vehicles by the end of 2016. However, before this is done, design of the airbags must also be completed by Aoxin Automobile. Aoxin is currently designing an airbag system for the e-Go EV however 2050 Motors cannot predict at this time whether the airbag system will suffice for the US market and/or may require additional airbags for successful crash testing. In addition, Aoxin Automobile has stated that the e-Go EV will be equipped with US DOT approved parts and equipment; these are, windshield, tires, breaking system, etc. 2050 Motors does not know at the present time if all the equipment on the e-Go EV will be DOT compliant, and 2050 Motors may or may not have to re-equip the parts, if any, either in China or the United States.

&#160; 

During the year 2013, both the engineers in the United States and in China collaborated on many aspects of the e-Go EV to meet or surpass the US standards. These modifications have been incorporated into the e-Go EV. One of these modifications was to specifically address a new crash test which is not yet required in the United States. This test, created by the leading insurance industry group IIHS, is called the overlap test which insurance companies are trying to adopt into the standard automobile crash test program. The crash test consists of a vehicle to be submitted under new safety standards for front-end collisions in which 25% of the front end, on the driver&#8217;s side, strikes a 5-foot-tall barrier at 40 mph. The overlap test has proven to be very difficult for present automobiles on the road to pass. In fact, thirteen automobiles produced by the top end manufacturers such as Mercedes, Audi, etc., have either failed or done very poorly in this crash test sequence. 

&#160; 

2050 Motors intends to import all vehicles completely fabricated and assembled in China from Aoxin Automobile. 2050 Motors will market the e-Go EV vehicles in designated markets and is not expected to need any raw materials, components or equipment, except spare parts which will be supplied by Aoxin Automobile. However, the e-Go EV and all of its parts and equipment must be DOT approved. After the demonstration vehicles are delivered to the USA, some of the existing parts of the e-Go EV may or may not meet DOT specifications. Aoxin Automobile has made every effort to build the e-Go EV according to American standards. However, there is no certainty that all the parts will be DOT approved. 2050 Motors may elect to secure replacement parts here in the USA or in China for installation either in the United States or in China, if required. 

&#160; 

2050 Motors intends to initially sell the e-Go EV to a network of customers primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. 2050 Motors plans to establish a service and parts center, which would be separate from the Showroom. The Showroom facility will be at an area with high volume of people in Las Vegas, where visitors to the city can directly view the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may also elect to sell the e-Go EV at selected distributors in the Las Vegas Area, which have already provided letters of interest to sell our vehicles. 2050 Motors&#8217; initial plan is not to sell the vehicle outside of the Las Vegas vicinity, consisting of an area within a radius of 100 miles. In the metropolitan area of Las Vegas the population is approximately 1.9 million people. This is the Company&#8217;s current marketing plan in order to effectively market to and support people that work and/or live in Las Vegas. 

&#160; 

2050 Motors is a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out our business plan or achieve any revenues or profitability. 2050 Motors was established in October 2012 and it has not generated any revenues nor have we realized a profit from our operations to date, and there is little likelihood that we will generate any revenues or realize any profits in the short term. Any profitability in the future from its business will be dependent upon the successful marketing and sales of the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may not be able to successfully carry out its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will ever achieve any revenues or profitability. Accordingly, its prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business, especially one in the automobile industry, and therefore it is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk. 

&#160; 

We are completely dependent on Aoxin Automobile to supply us with the e-Go EV and other trucks and automobiles and parts and components thereto. The inability of Aoxin Automobile to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver such vehicles and parts at prices and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in business conditions, global financial instability, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect Aoxin Automobile&#8217;s ability to deliver vehicles and/or parts on a timely basis and cause material adverse consequences to 2050 Motors. 

&#160; 

2050 Motors has signed an exclusive Agreement with Aoxin Automobile for the sale of these vehicles in the United States. Phase I. Phase II will involve assembly of these vehicles in the United States, creating hundreds of American jobs after all State and Federal Standards and requirements have been met. Phase III, assembly and manufacturing of the complete vehicle in the United States, will occur after an established market is created in Phase I and Phase II, creating upwards of a thousand US jobs for each manufacturing facility. 

&#160; 

Research by Aoxin Automobile over the past five years developed this advanced all-electric vehicle. The e-Go EV is a five passenger sedan which weighs only 1,450 lbs with its battery pack included. It will be the first vehicle of this advanced type to be sold in the price range of less than $35,000. 

&#160; 

The body components are built out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third its weight constructed over a strong ultralight aluminum frame chassis and race car suspension. This ensures that the vehicle will be the safest and strongest ever built for the consumer market. It will also be the most efficient vehicle ever built, capable of achieving 150+ miles to the gallon energy equivalent.
