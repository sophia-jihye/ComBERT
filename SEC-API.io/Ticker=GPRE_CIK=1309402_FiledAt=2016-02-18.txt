&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Green Plains is an Iowa corporation that was founded in June 2004 . We are a Fortune 1000, vertically integrated ethanol producer, marketer and distributor focused on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and risk management strategy. We have operations throughout the ethanol value chain, beginning upstream with grain handling and storage, continuing through ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil production and ending downstream with our marketing and distribution services . We believe owning and operating assets throughout the ethanol value chain enables us to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, differentiating us from companies focused only on ethanol production. 

&#160; 

We group our business activities into four operating segments to manage performance : 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production se gment includes 14 ethanol plants in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. At capacity, w e expect to process approximately 430 million bushels of corn per year and produce approximately 1.2 billion gallons of ethanol, 3.4 million tons of distillers grains and 275 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil , making us the fourth largest ethanol producer in North America. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Agribusiness. Our agribusiness segment includes grain procurement and storage capacity of approximately 5 8 . 6 million bushels and a cattle feedlot operation with the capacity to support 70,000 head of cattle. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Marketing and Distribution. Our marketing and distribution segment markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethan ol for a third-party producer and buy and sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Partnership. Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership&#8217;s assets include 30 ethanol storage facilities, 8 fuel terminal facilities and approximately 2,500 leased railcars. 

Risk Management and Hedging Activities 

&#160; 

Our profitability is highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, corn and natural gas. Since market price fluctuations among these commodities are not always correlated, ethanol production may be unprofitable at times. We use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to monitor real-time operating price risk exposure at each of our plants to secure favorable margins , when available, or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. Our multiple businesses and revenue streams also help to diversify our operations and profitability. 

&#160; 

We use forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil production or buy some of the corn or natural gas we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas , ethanol and other commodities . The financial impact of these activities depends on price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver those commodities. We do not speculate on general price movements by taking significant unhedged positions on commodities. 

&#160; 

Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying commodity and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We are focused on managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams. Our competitive strengths include: 

&#160; 

Disciplined Risk Management . Risk management is our core competency and we use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to maintain a disciplined approach. Our internally developed operating margin management system allows us to monitor real-time commodity price risk exposure at each of our plants and focus on locking in favorable margins or temporarily reducing production levels during periods of compressed margins. 

&#160; 

Acquisition and Integration Capabilities . We have the ability to acquire assets that create synergies and enhance our ability to mitigate risks. Our balance sheet allows us to be opportunistic in that process. Since inception, we built or acquired 14 ethanol plants and installed , or are in the process of installing at the Hopewell plant, corn oil extraction technology at each of our plants to generate incremental returns. In addition, we purchased or built &#160; a grain handling and stor age business, a cattle feedlot operation, and te rminal and distribution facilities . Successful integration of these operations has enhanced our overall returns. 

&#160; 

Operational Excellence . Our plants are staffed by experienced industry personnel who share operational knowledge. We focus on making incremental operational improvements to enhance performance using real-time production data and control systems to monitor our plants and optimize performance. Our operational expertise provides us a cost advantage over most of our competitors and helps us improve the operating margins of acquired facilities. 

&#160; 

Vertical Integration . Our vertically integrated platform reduces commodity and operational risk and increases pricing visibility and influence in key markets. Combined, our ethanol production, agribusiness, marketing and distribution, and partnership segments provide efficiencies which extend across the ethanol value chain. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Proven Management Team . Our senior manage ment team averages more than 25 years of commodity risk management and related industry experience. We have specific expertise across all of our businesses, including plant operations and management, commodity markets and risk management , and ethanol marketing and distribution. Our management team&#8217;s level of operati onal and financial expertise is essential to successfully executing our business strategies. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply due to factors described below driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence goals and national security concerns: 

&#183; 

Emissions Reduction . In the 1990&#8217;s, federal law required the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline to reduce vehicle emissions in cities with unhealthy levels of air pollution, on a seasonal or year-round basis. Oxygenated gasoline is used to meet separate federal and state air emission standards. At the time, these oxygenates included ethanol and MTBE. However, the U.S. refining industry has since abandoned the use of MTBE, making ethanol the primary clean air oxygenate used. 

&#183; 

Octane Enhancer . Ethanol has an octane value of 113 and is the primary additive used by refiners to increase octane levels, producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades, to improve engine performance. According to the EIA, refiners are producing more conventional blendstocks for oxygenate blending, or CBOB, which is an 84 octane sub-grade gasoline which requires e thanol or another octane source to meet minimum octan e requirements for the U.S. gasoline market. CBOB represented approximately 80% of total conventional gasoline sold in 2015. 

&#183; 

Fuel Stock Extender . Ethanol is a valuable blend component used by U.S. refiners to extend fuel supply. According to the EIA, ethanol as a component of the domestic gasoline supply grew from 1.4% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2015, replacing the need for approximately 732 million barrels of oil in 2015. 

&#183; 

E15 Blending Waiver . Through a series of decisions beginning in October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver which permitted the use of E15 in model year 2001 and newer passenger vehicles, including cars, sport utility vehicles and light pickup trucks. In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale and use of E15 and in July 201 2, the nation&#8217;s first retail E15 was sold. On January 5, 2016, there were 189 retail fuel stations in 23 states offering E15 to consumers. 

&#183; 

Mandated Use of Renewable Fuels . The growth in domestic ethanol use has been supported by legislative requirements. Under the provisions of the EISA, the RFS II was established increasing the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with motor gasoline. In November 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.5 0 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

&#183; 

Net Ethanol Exports . Prior to 2010, the United States had a long history as a net importer of ethanol. In 2010, according to the USDA , the United States became the largest exporter of ethanol to world markets and lowest-cost producer, surpassing Brazil. According to the EIA, U.S. ethanol exports, net of imports, were approximately 730 million gallons in 2015 and 750 million gallons in 2014. 

&#160; 

In light of our industry&#8217;s environment, we intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies: 

&#160; 

Grow Organically. We seek expansion projects that leverage our assets&#8217; location and potential production capacity by maximizing operational capabilities or increasing grain storage capacity . We believe owning grain storage at our near our plants allows us to develop relationships with local producers and originate corn more effectively at a lower average cost. Since most of our plants are located in close proximity of our competitors in the Midwest, we believe this provides a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

Acquire Strategic Assets. We seek acquisitions that allow us to apply our specialized knowledge, existing processes and expandable infrastructure as a competitive advantage in select agricultural and energy markets. We maintain a disciplined evaluation process in pursuit of strategic assets, taking into consideration rigorous design, engineering, financial and geographic criteria, to ensure the assets will generate favorable returns. For our recently formed subsidiary, Green Plains Partners, our strategy is to acquire additional assets that can be offered to the partnership to generate incremental distributable cash flow. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Conduct Safe, Reliable, Efficient Operations and Improve Operational Efficiency. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and employ an extensive production control system at each plant to continuously monitor performance. We use the performance data to develop strategies that can be applied across our platform. In addition, we research operational processes that may enhance our efficiency by increasing yields, lowering processing cost per gallon and growing production volumes. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

We are disciplined in evaluating potential acquisitions for growth. Ethanol plants must meet rigorous design, engineering, valuation and geographic criteria to be considered. The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2015. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC. 

&#160; 

On October 2 3 , 2015, we a cquired an ethanol production facility located in Hopewell, Virginia for approximately $18.6 million , including liabilities assumed of approximately $0. 4 &#160; million. The dry mill ethanol plant&#8217;s production capacity is approximat ely 60 mmgy. &#160; W e resumed ethanol production &#160; at the plant on February 8, 2016 and c orn oil processing is expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

On November 12, 2015, we acquired Hereford Renewable Energy, LLC located in Hereford , Texas, for approximately $78.8 milli on for the ethanol plant assets, as well as working capital acquired or assumed of approximately $19.4 million. The &#160; purchase includes an ethanol plant with production capacity of approximat ely 100 mmgy , a corn oil extraction system , working capital and other related assets. 

&#160; 

As part of our Phase I ethanol production capacity ex pansion program, we &#160; added 35 mmgy of production capacity at a cost of $29.6 million through Decem ber 31, 2015 . We anticipate adding up to 50 mmgy of production capacity over the next 12 months. The total cost of the Phase I expansion is estimated to be approximately $49 .0 million. 

&#160; 

On November 4, 2015, the partnership announced plans to form a joint venture, as a 50% partner, to build an ethanol unit train terminal in Maumelle, Arkansas. The terminal will be capable of unloading 110-car unit trains in less than 24 hours and initially include storage for approximately 4.2 mmg of ethanol. The project, which will allow ethanol to be delivered more efficiently into Little Rock and surrounding markets, is expected to cost approximately $12 million and be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2016, the partnership acquired the storage and transportation assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from us for an initial consideration of $62.5 million. T he partnership used its revolving credit facility and cash on hand to fund the purchase of the assets. The acquired assets include three ethanol storage tanks that support the plants&#8217; combined expected production capacity of approximately 160 mmgy and 224 leased railcars with capacity of approximately 6.7 mmg. The partnership amended the storage and throughput agreement, increasing the minimum volume commitment to 246.5 mmg per calendar quarter. The partnership also amended the rail transportation services agreement, increasing the minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitme nt to 76 . 3 mmg. 

&#160; 

Initial Public Offering of Subsidiary 

&#160; 

We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to provide fuel storage and transportation services. We expect the partnership to be our primary downstream logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2015, the partnership completed its IPO. A total of 11,500,000 common units, representing limited partner interests, were sold to the public for $15.00 per common unit. The partnership received net proceeds of $157.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring fees and offering expenses, which it used to make a distribution of $155.3 million to us and pay $0.9 million in origination fees under its new $100.0 million revolving credit facility. The partnership retained the remaining $1. 3 million for general purposes. 

&#160; 

We now own a 62.5% limited partner interest consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units, a 2.0% general partner interest in the partnership and all of the partnership&#8217;s incentive distribution rights . The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

During the subordination period, which is described in the partnership agreement, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive distributions until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. If the partnership does not pay distributions on the subordinated units, the subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Each subordinated unit will convert into one common unit at the end of the subordination period. 

&#160; 

In conjunction with the IPO, we contributed our downstream ethanol transportation and storage assets to the partnership, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

27 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 12 ethanol production plants, 

&#183; 

8 fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and approximately 

&#183; 

2,210 leased rail cars and other transportation assets. 

&#160; 

A substantial portion of the partnership&#8217;s revenue is derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with our subsidiary, Green Plains Trade, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

10-year storage and throughput agreement, 

&#183; 

6-year rail transportation services agreement, and 

&#183; 

1-year trucking transportation agreement. 

&#160; 

The partnership also assumed various terminal services agreements, including a 2.5-year agreem ent for the Birmingham, Alabama unit train terminal. The partnership&#8217;s storage and throughput agreement and some of the terminal services agreements, including the Birmingham terminal services agreement, are supported by minimum volume commitments. The rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. 

&#160; 

We also have agreements with the partnership that establish fees for general and administrative services, and operational and maintenance services. These transactions are eliminated when we consolidate our financial results. 

&#160; 

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Ethanol Production Segment 

&#160; 

Industry Overview. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is a colorless liquid produced by fermenting carbohydrates found in a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, and other cellulosic matte r found in plants. M ost of the ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because it contains large quantities of carbohydrates that convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass, can be handled efficiently and is in greater supply than other grains. One bushel, or 56 pounds, of corn, produces approximately 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 16.5 pounds of distillers grains and 0.6 pounds of corn oil. Outside of the Unites States, sugarcane is the primary feedstock used in ethanol production. 

&#160; 

Ethanol is a significant component of the biofuels industry, which includes all transportation fuels derived from renewable biological materials. Biofuels are an excellent oxygenate and source of octanes. When added to petroleum-based transportation fuels, oxygenates reduce &#160; vehicle emissions. Ethanol is the most economical oxygenate and source of octanes available on the market and its production costs are competitive with gasoline. 

&#160; 

The global ethanol industry has grown significantly over the past decade due to ethanol&#8217;s environmental and economic benefits. Approximately 30 countries including the EU, which i s regulated by a single policy with specific national targets for each country, either mandate or offer incentives for blending ethanol and biodiesel with motor fuels. These policies are motivated by the desire to reduce pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on foreign oil. Annual reported ethanol prod uction worldwide has increased from approximately 5.0 billion gallons in 2001 to 24.6 billion gallons in 2014, and from 1.8 billion gallons in 2001 to 14.8 billion gallons in 2015 in the United Stat es, according to the EIA. The United States and Brazil are the two largest producers and exporters of ethanol in the world. In 2015, ethanol comprised approximately 10% of the U.S. gasoline market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Ethanol Plants. We operate 14 dry mill ethanol production plants, located in eight states, that produce ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil:

We constructed these four plants; all other ethanol plants were acquired. 

(2) 

The Hopewell plant resumed ethanol production on February 8, 2016. 

&#160; 

The majority of o ur plants are equipp ed with industry-leading ICM or Delta-T ethanol processing technology. Our years of experience building, acquiring and operating these technologies provides us with a deep understanding of how to effectively and efficiently manage both systems for maximum performance. All of our plants are adjacent to major rail lines. 

&#160; 

Corn Feedstock and Ethanol Production. Our plants use corn as feedstock in a dry mill ethanol production process. Each of our plants requires approximately 20 million to 40 million bushels of corn annually, depending on its production capacity. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations driven by a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs, freight costs and global demand. Ethanol producers are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to customers since ethanol competes with other fuels. 

&#160; 

Our corn supply is obtained primarily from local markets by our agribusiness segment and subsequently provided to our ethan ol production segment. We use cash and forward purchase contracts with grain producers and elevators to buy corn. At ten of our ethanol plants, we maintain direct relationships with local farmers, grain elevators and cooperatives, which serve as our primary sources of grain feedstock. Most farmers in the area where these plants are located store corn in their own storage facilities. This allows us to purchase much of the corn needed to supply our plants directly from farmers throughout the year. At four of our ethanol plants, we contract with third-party grain originators to supply the corn necessary for ethanol production. These contracts terminate between October 2016 and November 2023. Each of our plants is also situated on rail lines or has other logistical solutions to access corn supplies from other regions of the country should local supplies become insufficient. 

&#160; 

Corn is received at the plant by truck or rail then weighed and unloaded into a receiving building. Storage bins are used to inventory grain that is passed through a scalper to remove rocks and debris prior to processing. The corn is then transported to a hammer mill where it is ground into coarse flour and conveyed into a slurry tank for enzymatic processing. Water, heat and enzymes are added to convert the complex starch molecules into simpler carbohydrates. The slurry is heated to reduce the potential of microbial contamination and pumped in to a liquefaction tank where additional enzymes are added. Next, the grain slurry is pumped into fermenters, where yeast, enzymes, and nutrients are ad ded and the batch fermentation process is started. A beer column, within the distillation system, separates the alcohol from the spent grain mash. The alcohol is dehydrated to 200-proof alcohol and either pumped in to a holding tank and blended with approximately two percent denaturant as it is pumped into finished product storage tanks , or marketed as undenatured ethanol. 

&#160; 

Distillers Grains. The spent grain mash is pumped from the beer column into a decanter-type centrifuge for dewatering. The water, or thin stillage, is pumped from the centrifuge in to an evaporator, where it is dried into a thick syrup. The solids, or wet cake, that exit the centrifuge are conveyed to the dryer system and dried at varying temperatures to produce distillers 

&#160;

grains. Syrup might be reapplied to the wet cake prior to drying &#160; to provid e additional nutrients. Distillers grains, the principal co-product of the ethanol production process, are used as high-protein, high-energy animal feed and marketed to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries. 

&#160; 

We can produce three forms of distillers grains, depending on the number of times the solids are passed through the dryer system: 

&#183; 

w et distillers grains, which contain approximately 65% to 70% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three days and is therefore sold only to dairies or feedlots within the immediate vicinity , 

&#183; 

m odified wet distillers grains, which is dried further to approximately 50% to 55% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three weeks and are marketed to regional dairies and feedlots , and 

&#183; 

d ried distillers grains, which have been dried more extensively to approximately 10% to 12% moisture, have an almost indefinite shelf life and may be stored, sold and shipped to any market . 

&#160; 

Corn Oil. Corn oil systems extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately before the production of distillers grains. Corn oil is produced by processing the syrup and evaporated thin stillage t hrough a decanter-style, or disk- stack , centrifuge. The centrifuges separate the relatively light corn oil from the heavier components of the syrup, eliminating the need for significant retention time. We extract approximately 0.7 pounds of corn oil per bushel of corn used to produce ethanol. Industrial uses for corn oil include feedstock for biodiesel, livestock feed additives, rubber substitutes, rust preventatives, inks, textiles, soaps and insecticides. &#160; The syrup is blend ed into wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains. 

&#160; 

Utilities . The production of ethanol requires significant amounts of natural gas, electricity and water. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas . Depending on production parameters, our ethanol plants use approx imately 22,000 to 33,000 BTUs of natural gas per gallon of production. We have service agreements for the natural gas we need and pay tariff fees to providers that transport the gas through pipelines to our plants. 

&#160; 

Electricity . Our plants require between 0.5 and 1.2 kilowatt hours of electricity per gallon of production. Local utilities supply the necessary electricity to all of our ethanol plants. 

&#160; 

Water . While some of our plants satisfy a majority of their water requirements from wells located on their respective properties, each plant also obtains drinkable water from local municipal water sources. Each facility operates a filtration system to purify the well water that is used for its operations. Local municipalities supply all of the necessary water for our plants that do not have onsite wells. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled in the production process. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Agribusiness Segment 

&#160; 

Our agribusiness segment facilities include five grain elevators in four states with combined grain storage capacity of approximately 11. 6 m illion bushels, a cattle feedlot operation with the capacity to support 70,000 head of cattle and 2.8 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and grain storage at our ethanol plants of approximately 44.2 million bushels, detailed in the following table :

We buy bulk grain, primarily corn and soybeans, from area producers, and provide grain drying and storage services to those producers. We buy cattle from producers and order buyers, the majority of which are from K ansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. The grain is used as feedstock for our ethanol plants or sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers. The cattle are sold to meat processors. Bulk grain and cattle commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of grain and cattle, as well as grain and cattle held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times. 

&#160; 

Seasonality is present within our agribusiness operations. The fall harvest period typically results in higher handling margins and stronger financial results during the fourth quarter of each year. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution Segment 

&#160; 

Through Green Plains Trade, w e market the ethanol we produce and a third-party produce s to local, regional, national and international customers. We also purchase ethanol from independent producers for pricing arbitrage. To achieve the best price for the ethanol we market, we sell to various markets under sales agreements w ith integrated energy companies; retailers, traders and resellers in the United States and buyers for export to Brazil, Canada, Europe and other international markets. Under these agreements, ethanol is priced under fixed and indexed pricing arrangements. 

&#160; 

We market wet, modified wet and dried distillers grains to local markets and dried distillers grains to local, national and international markets. The bulk of our demand is for deliveries to geographic regions that do not have significant local corn or distillers grains production. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our markets can be further segmented by geographic region and livestock industry. Most of our modified wet distillers grains are sold to midwestern feedlot markets. Our dried distillers grains are shipped to feedlots and poultry markets, as well as Texas and West Coast rail markets. A substantial amount of dried distillers grains are shipped by barge and rail to regional and national markets. Some of our distillers grains are shipped by truck to dairy, beef, and poultry operations in the eastern United States. We also ship by railcar to Eastern and Southeastern feed mills, poultry and dairy operations, and domestic trade companies. Dried distillers grains are also sold to exporters for shipme nt to international markets. Our largest export markets in 2015 included Vietnam, Thailand, Korea and Mexico . Access to diversified markets allows us to sell product to customers offering the highest net price. 

&#160; 

Our corn oil is sold primarily to biodiesel manufactures and, to a lesser extent, feedlot and poultry markets. We transport our corn oil by truck to locations in a close proximity to our ethanol plants primarily in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. We also transport corn oil by rail to national markets as well as to exporters for shipment to international markets. 

&#160; 

Our railcar fleet for the marketing and distribution segment consists of approximately 900 leased hopper cars for the transportation of distillers grains and approximately 100 leased tank cars for the transportation of corn oil. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years. &#160; 

&#160; 

Partnership Segment 

&#160; 

Our partnership segment provides fuel storage and transporta tion services through its (i) 30 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 14 ethanol production plants, (ii) eight fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and (iii) a leased railcar fleet and other transportation assets. &#160; 

&#160; 

Transportation and Delivery. Most ethanol plants are situated near major highways or rail lines to ensure efficient movement. We distribute ethanol by moving product from our etha nol plants to bulk terminals by r ailcar or truck. We also manage the logistics and transportation requirements of our customers to improve our fleet&#8217;s efficiency and reduce operating costs. &#160; 

&#160; 

De liveries within 150 miles of the partnership&#8217;s fuel terminal facilities and our plants are generally transported by truck. Deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads, allowing our plants to ship product throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

To meet the challenge of marketing ethanol and distillers grains to diverse market segments, several of our plants are capable of handling more than 150 railcars. Some of our locations have large loop tracks with unit train loading capabilities for both ethanol and dried distillers grains and spurs to connect the loop to the mainline or allow the movement and storage of railcars on site. 

&#160; 

The partnership&#8217;s railcar fleet consists of approximately 2, 5 00 leased tank cars for the transportation of ethanol. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years. &#160; 

&#160; 

We seek to optimize the partnership&#8217;s rail car assets and will transport products other than ethanol and distillers grains depending on market opportunities and have used a portion of our railcar fleet to transport crude oil for third parties and to lease railcars to other users. 

&#160; 

Terminal and Distribution Services. Ethanol is transported from the partnership&#8217;s terminals to third-party terminal racks where it is blended with gasoline and transferred to the loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. The partnership own s and operate s fuel holding tanks and terminals, and provide terminal services and logistics solutions to markets that do not have efficient access to renewable fuels. The partnership operate s fuel terminals at one owned and seven leased locations in seven states with a combined storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg and throughput capacity of approximately 822 mmgy . We also have 30 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 14 ethanol production plants with a combined storage capacity of approximately 31.8 million gallons and throughput capacity of approximately 1.7 bgy .

Our Competition 

&#160; 

Domestic Ethanol Competitors 

&#160; 

We compete with other domestic ethanol producers. According to E thanol Producer m agazine, there were 216 ethanol-producing plants in the United States capable of producing 15.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually as of December 31, 2015. The industry does not typically operate at 100% o f capacity. Historical annual production rates to total plant capacity averages between the high 80 percent to low 90 percent range. The three largest ethanol producers by capacity in North America are: Archer Daniels Midland Company, POET and Valero Energy Corporation. We are the fourth largest producer by capacity, followed by Flint Hills Resources. The top five producers&#8217; annual production capacit y ranges between approximately 8 00 mmgy and 1,800 mmgy. 

&#160; 

In addition, o ur competitors include plants owned by farmers, oil refiners and retail fuel operators. These competitors may continue to operate their plants even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations. 

&#160; 

Demand for corn from ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists in all areas and regions in which we operate. At December 31, 2015, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and Tennessee had a total of 111 operational ethanol plants, according to Ethanol Producer m agazine. Iowa and Nebraska have the largest concentration of operational plants, including 42 primarily in the northern and central Iowa and 26 in Nebraska. 

&#160; 

Foreign Ethanol Competitors 

&#160; 

We also complete globally with production from other countries. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States. Brazil&#8217;s ethanol production is made from sugarcane and, depending on feedstock prices, may be less expensive to produce than ethanol made from corn. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for 

&#160;

obligated parties to meet this standard. Any significant additional ethanol production capacity could create excess supply in world markets, resulting in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. 

&#160; 

Other Competition 

&#160; 

Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Ethanol production technologies also continue to evolve. We expect changes to occur primarily in the area of ethanol made from other sources of biomass, such as switch grass or fast-growing poplar trees. Since all of our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, adapting our plants for a different feedstock or process system would require additional capital investments and retooling. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Government Ethanol Programs and Policies 

&#160; 

Demand for cleaner, more sustainable transportation fuel is growing worldwide. Growth in ethanol demand has been driven by policies, adopted by more than 30 countries including the EU, which is regulated by a single policy with specific national targets for each country, calling for increased ethanol in motor fuel. Ethanol has become a crucial component of the global fuel supply as an economical oxygenate and source of octanes. 

&#160; 

In an effort to reduce the United States&#8217; dependence on foreign oil, federal and state governments enacted numerous policies, incentives and subsidies to encourage use of domestically produced alternative fuels. While the ethanol industry has benefited significantly as a result, the need for economic incentives may diminish as ethanol continues to gain acceptance as a primary fuel and fuel extender. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under R FS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. 

&#160; 

RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. RFS II increased the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with transportation fuel, mandating a minimum of 12.0 billion gallons of corn-based renewable fuel in 2010 and increasing that requirement by 600 million gallons each year to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. 

&#160; 

The EPA also has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions are met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or (2) implementation of the requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. During the third quarter of 2012, several waiver requests were filed with the EPA due to drought conditions, which were subsequently denied. &#160; 

&#160; 

Several amendments to the Energy Policy Modernization Act were introduced in the U.S. Senate that were removed from consideration in early February 2016, including amendments to repeal RFS II, eliminate the corn ethanol mandate in RFS II and prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from using Commodity Credit Corporation or other funds to construct blender pumps. It is not known if a vote on the numerous amendments to the EPMA or senate passage of the EPMA will take place. &#160; 

&#160; 

In November 2013, the EPA released its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the 2014 Renewable Fuel Standard, seeking comment on a range of total renewable fuel volumes and proposing a level within the range of 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billion gallons of corn-derived renewable fuel. The proposal included a variety of approaches for setting the 2014 standard and a number of production and consumption ranges of biofuels covered by RFS II to address two constraints of RFS II: (1) the volume limitation s of ethanol given the practical constraints of vehicles that can use higher ethanol blends, and (2) the industry&#8217;s ability to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November 2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program before the end of the year. &#160; 

&#160; 

On June 10, 2015, the EPA proposed volume targets for conventional ethanol of 13.25 billion gallons, 13.4 0 billion gallons and 14.0 0 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. On November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final 

&#160;

volume requirements for conventional ethanol that were hi gher than levels proposed in June of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.5 0 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

&#160; 

On January 6, 2015, H.R. 21 was introduced to provide a comprehensive assessment of the scientific and technical research on the implications of mid-level ethanol blends, seeking to eliminate the waiver granted by the EPA allowing E15 in 2001 and newer cars and light trucks. On January 21, 2015, H.R. 434 was introduced, seeking to modify the Clean Air Act by limiting or removing the authority of the EPA to grant waivers for higher blends of ethanol in the U.S. gasoline supply and repeal existing waivers that the EPA previously granted. On February 4, 2015, H.R.704 was introduced to limit ethanol blends greater than 10% in the U.S. fuel supply and repeal the renewable fuel standard. 

&#160; 

CAFE was first enacted by Congress in 1975 to reduce energy consumption by increasing the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. CAF E has helped the ethanol industry by encouraging the use of E85. CAF E provides a 54% efficiency bonus to flexible-fuel vehicles running on E85. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are 17.4 million flexible fuel vehicles on U.S. roads today. E85 is sold at mor e than 3,000 fuel stations in 47 states. 

&#160; 

In April 2013, the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 1696 to extend the publicly traded partnership ownership structure to renewable energy projects, including ethanol production. The legislation was proposed to provide a more level financing system and tax burden for renewable energy equal to fossil energy projects. H.R. 1696 did not advance out of committee during the 113th Congress and its co-sponsors have not re-introduced the bill. 

&#160; 

In addition to these federal standards, many states have taken steps to encourage ethanol consumption including tax credits, mandated blend rates and subsidies. 

&#160; 

In July 2010, President Obama signed the Reform Act to improve transparency and accountability in the derivative markets. The Reform Act increases the regulatory authority of the CFTC regarding over-the-counter derivatives; however, there is uncertainty remaining on several issues related to market clearing , market participants and capital requirements. Although only some of the issues have been addressed, we do not anticipate any material impact to our risk management strategy. 

&#160; 

In January 2012, the Domestic Alternative Fuels Act of 2012 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and re-introduced in March 2013 as H.R. 1214 to protect consumers who unintentionally use an alternative fuel that is not approved for use by the automobile manufacturer. Some automobile manufacturers have stated that any damage resulting from misfueling is not covered under warranty. In June 2013, the American Fuel Protection Act of 2013, or H.R. 2267, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives to make the United States exclusively liable for damages resulting from, or aggravated by, the inclusion of ethanol in transportation fuel. Both bills failed to advance out of congressional committee and were not enacted into law. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Regulation 

&#160; 

Our ethanol production and agribusiness activities are subject to environmental and other regulations. We obtain environmental permits to construct and operate our ethanol plants. 

&#160; 

Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 

&#160; 

While our plants our grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS II mandate, expansion above these levels will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement. This may require us to obtain additio nal permits, achieve the EPA&#8217;s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. 

&#160; 

CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS in November 2012, and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The U. S. ethanol industry relies heavily on tank cars to deliver its product to market. As of January 1, 2016, the company leases approximately 2,600 tank cars, including 2,500 leased by o ur partnership to transport ethanol . In July 2014, the DOT proposed new regulations to improve the transportation of flammable materials by rail, which it finalized on May 1, 2015. The Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. 

&#160; 

Parts of our business are regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Our agribusiness operations are subject to government regulation and regulation by private sector assoc iations. Our production levels are indirectly affected by f ederal government programs, which include the USDA, acreage control and price support programs. In addition, the grain we sell must conform to official grade standards imposed by the USDA. Other examples of government policies that may impact our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos. 

&#160; 

In September 2015 , in response to FSMA, the FDA issued rules for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for food for a nimals. The rules require FDA- registered food facilities to address safety conce rns for sourcing, manufacturing and shipping food products through food safety programs and plans , which includes conducti ng hazard analyses, developing risk-based preventative controls and monitoring, and addressing intentional adulteration, recalls, sanitary transportation and supplier verification. &#160; While we are still reviewing the regulation, we may need additional resources to comply with the new requirements since our distillers grains are used as feed for animals. Our cattle feedlot operation &#160; is included under the FDA&#8217;s definition of &#8220;farm&#8221; and is exempt from the FSMA requirements. 

&#160; 

We also employ maintenance and operations personnel at each of our ethanol plants. In addition to the attention we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations of our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 

&#160; 

BioProcess Algae Joint Venture 

&#160; 

We are a majority owner of the BioProcess Algae joint venture that was formed in 2008. The joint venture is focused on developing technology to grow and harvest algae in commercially viable quantities, using the carbon dioxide that is created as part of the ethanol production process. Through multiple stages of expansion, BioProcess Algae constructed a five-acre algae farm next to our Shenandoah, Iowa ethanol plant and has operated its Grower Harvesters&#8482; bioreactors since 2011. The joint venture continues to take critical steps towards commercialization, including verifying growth rates, energy balances, capital requirements and operating expenses of the technology. &#160; In 2015, we narrowed our focus on human nutrition, concentrating on protein value and EPA omega-3 fatty acids, and acquired a second production location , located in Texas , to further support our research and development efforts. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2015, we had approximately 995 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, including 163 employees at our corporate office in Omaha, Nebraska.
