 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a Delaware corporation which owns and manages certain operating subsidiaries and investments, anchored by a core position in property and casualty reinsurance and insurance. We were initially incorporated in 1929, were subsequently incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the State of Delaware and, in December 1986, we succeeded to the business of our parent company, Alleghany Corporation. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary AIHL and its subsidiaries, we are engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. AIHL&#146;s insurance operations are principally conducted by its subsidiaries RSUI, CapSpecialty and PacificComp. CapSpecialty has been a subsidiary of AIHL since January 2002, RSUI has been a subsidiary of AIHL since July 2003 and PacificComp has been a subsidiary of AIHL since July 2007. AIHL Re, a captive reinsurance company which provides reinsurance to Alleghany&#146;s insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates, has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alleghany since its formation in May 2006. Our reinsurance operations commenced on March 6, 2012 when we consummated a merger with TransRe, and TransRe became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our public equity investments, including those held by TransRe&#146;s and AIHL&#146;s operating subsidiaries, are managed primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary Roundwood. 

Although our primary sources of revenues and earnings are our reinsurance and insurance operations and investments, we also manage, source, execute and monitor certain private capital investments primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Capital. Alleghany Capital&#146;s private capital investments are included in corporate activities for segment reporting purposes and include: (i) SORC, an exploration and production company focused on enhanced oil recovery, headquartered in Golden, Colorado; (ii) Bourn &#38; Koch, a manufacturer and remanufacturer/retrofitter of precision machine tools and supplier of replacement parts, headquartered in Rockford, Illinois; (iii) Kentucky Trailer, a manufacturer of custom trailers and truck bodies for the moving and storage industry and other markets, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky; (iv) IPS, a technical service provider focused on the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, headquartered in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, acquired on October 31, 2015 for $106.3 million; (v) an approximately 40 percent equity interest in ORX Exploration, Inc., or &#147;ORX,&#148; a regional oil and gas exploration and production company, headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana; and (vi) a 30 percent equity interest in Jazwares, LLC, or &#147;Jazwares,&#148; a toy and consumer electronics company, headquartered in Sunrise, Florida, which interest was acquired on July 31, 2014 for $60.3 million. In addition, we own and manage properties in the Sacramento, California region through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Properties. 

We owned a minority stake in Homesite Group Incorporated, or &#147;Homesite,&#148; a national, full-service, mono-line provider of homeowners insurance, until its sale to American Family Insurance Company, a Wisconsin-based mutual insurance company, on December 31, 2013. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $22.8 billion and total stockholders&#146; equity attributable to Alleghany stockholders of $7.6 billion. 

Our principal executive offices are located in leased office space at 7 Times Square Tower, New York, New York 10036, and our telephone number is (212) 752-1356.

Segment Information 

Our segments are reported in a manner consistent with the way management evaluates the businesses. As such, we classify our business into two reportable segments &#150; reinsurance and insurance. In addition, reinsurance and insurance underwriting activities are evaluated separately from investment and corporate activities. The primary components of corporate activities are Alleghany Properties, SORC, Bourn &#38; Koch, our investments in Homesite (prior to its sale on December 31, 2013) and ORX and other activities at the parent level. Beginning August 30, 2013, July 31, 2014 and October 31, 2015, corporate activities also include the operating results of Kentucky Trailer, our investment in Jazwares and the operating results of IPS, respectively. See below and Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; of this Form 10-K for an analysis of our underwriting results by segment and corporate activities, and Part II, Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Consolidated Results of Operations.&#148; 

Reinsurance Segment 

General . The reinsurance segment consists of property and casualty reinsurance operations conducted by TransRe&#146;s reinsurance operating subsidiaries. 

TransRe, through its principal wholly-owned subsidiaries Transatlantic Reinsurance Company, or &#147;TRC,&#148; TransRe London Ltd., or &#147;TRL,&#148; and TransRe Zurich Ltd., or &#147;TRZ,&#148; offers reinsurance capacity to reinsurance and insurance companies for property and casualty products. These products are distributed through brokers and on a direct basis in both the domestic and foreign markets. TransRe is headquartered in New York, New York with five other locations in the U.S. and has operations worldwide, including: Africa, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, five locations in Asia, three locations in Central and South America, and seven locations in the U.K. and Europe. TRC is licensed, accredited or authorized or can serve as a reinsurer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico and Guam. TRC is also licensed in Bermuda, Canada, Japan, the U.K., the Dominican Republic, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#146;s Republic of China, Germany, Australia and Singapore. In addition, TRL is licensed as a reinsurer in the U.K. and TRZ is licensed as a reinsurer in Switzerland and Dubai. 

The reinsurance segment is reported by two major product lines, &#147;property&#148; and &#147;casualty &#38; other.&#148; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Property . TransRe&#146;s principal lines of business within property include fire, allied lines, auto physical damage and homeowners multiple peril lines (which include property catastrophe risks). In 2015, property reinsurance accounted for approximately 32 percent of TransRe&#146;s gross premiums written. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Casualty &#38; other . TransRe&#146;s principal lines of business within casualty &#38; other include liability (including directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability, errors and omissions liability and general liability), medical malpractice, ocean marine and aviation, auto liability (including non-standard risks), accident and health, surety and credit. In 2015, casualty &#38; other reinsurance accounted for approximately 68 percent of TransRe&#146;s gross premiums written. Reinsurance contracts are generally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. TransRe offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis. Treaty reinsurance is a contractual arrangement that provides for the automatic reinsuring of all or a portion of a specified class of risk underwritten by the ceding company. Facultative reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks. Rather than agreeing to reinsure all or a portion of a class of risk, the reinsurer separately rates and underwrites each risk. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased for risks not covered by treaty reinsurance or for individual risks covered by reinsurance treaties that are in need of capacity beyond that provided by such treaties. 

A ceding company&#146;s reinsurance program may involve pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis. TransRe provides pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance for most major lines of 

&#160;

business. Under pro rata reinsurance (also referred to as proportional or quota share reinsurance), the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion, and such proportional sharing of losses may be subject to a predetermined limit. As pro rata business is a proportional sharing of premiums and losses between ceding company and reinsurer, generally the underwriting reinsurance results of such business more closely reflect the underwriting results of the business ceded than do the results of excess-of-loss business. In pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission, which is generally based on the ceding company&#146;s cost of obtaining the business being reinsured, such as brokers&#146; and agents&#146; commissions, local taxes and administrative expenses. Under excess-of-loss reinsurance (also referred to as non-proportional reinsurance), the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company for all or a portion of the losses in excess of a predetermined amount, usually up to a predetermined limit. Premiums paid by the ceding company to the reinsurer for excess-of-loss coverage are generally not proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. Often there is no ceding commission on excess-of-loss reinsurance and therefore the pricing mechanism used by reinsurers in those instances is a rate applicable to premiums of the individual policy or policies subject to the reinsurance agreement. Both pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. 

As of December 31, 2015, the statutory surplus of TRC was $4.8 billion, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, or &#147;SAP,&#148; and the consolidated equity of TransRe was $5.2 billion, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or &#147;GAAP.&#148; 

Distribution. TransRe provides property and casualty reinsurance capacity through brokers as well as directly to insurance and reinsurance companies in both the domestic and foreign markets. In 2015, approximately 83 percent of TransRe&#146;s gross premiums written were written through brokers with the balance written directly. In the reinsurance brokerage industry, brokers are engaged by the ceding companies to place reinsurance on their behalf. In 2015, companies controlled by Aon plc, Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Group Holdings, plc, were TransRe&#146;s largest brokerage sources of business, accounting for approximately 26 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of gross premiums written. These three international brokers dominate the reinsurance brokerage industry. Due to the substantial percentages of premiums written through these brokers, the loss of business from any one of them could have a material adverse effect on TransRe&#146;s business. 

Underwriting. TransRe&#146;s underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among TransRe&#146;s underwriters, actuaries and claims staff, as appropriate. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with TransRe&#146;s underwriting guidelines and objectives, and most treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses conducted by TransRe. TransRe&#146;s actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered. Property catastrophe exposed treaties are generally evaluated using industry standard models. These models are used as a guide for risk assessment and are continually updated. TransRe also frequently conducts underwriting and claims audits at the offices of a ceding company before and after entering into major treaties, because reinsurers, including TransRe, do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and, consequently, are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding company. Such dependence subjects TransRe, and reinsurers in general, to the possibility that the ceding companies have not adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and, therefore, that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate the reinsurer for the risk assumed. 

TransRe often seeks to lead treaty arrangements. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and takes the initiative in negotiating price, terms and conditions. TransRe believes that this strategy enables it to influence more effectively the terms and conditions of the treaties in which it participates. When TransRe does not lead a treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty. TransRe may decline any treaty business offered to it based upon its assessment of all relevant factors. Such factors include type and level of risk assumed; actuarial and underwriting judgment with respect to rate adequacy; various treaty terms; prior and anticipated loss experience (including exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes) on the treaty; prior business experience with the ceding company; overall financial position; operating results; ratings from credit rating agencies of the ceding company; and social, legal, regulatory, environmental and general economic conditions affecting the risks assumed or the ceding company. 

&#160;

Ratings . TRC, TRL and TRZ are rated &#147;A+&#148; by Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services, or &#147;S&#38;P,&#148; and A (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company, Inc., or &#147;A.M. Best,&#148; and TRC is rated A1 by Moody&#146;s Investors Service Inc., or &#147;Moody&#146;s,&#148; independent organizations that analyze the insurance industry and the financial positions of reinsurance and insurance companies. Additional information regarding ratings and the risks related to ratings from ratings agencies can be found on pages 57 and 58 of this Form 10-K. 

Insurance Segment 

The insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance operations conducted by AIHL through its insurance operating subsidiaries RSUI, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia; CapSpecialty, headquartered in Middleton, Wisconsin; and PacificComp, headquartered in Westlake Village, California. AIHL Re, our Vermont-domiciled captive reinsurance company, provides reinsurance to our insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates. Unless we state otherwise, references to AIHL include the operations of RSUI, CapSpecialty, PacificComp and AIHL Re. 

In 2015, property insurance accounted for approximately 39 percent, and casualty insurance accounted for approximately 61 percent, of AIHL&#146;s gross premiums written. 

RSUI 

General. RSUI, which includes the operations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries RSUI Indemnity Company, or &#147;RIC,&#148; Landmark American Insurance Company, or &#147;Landmark,&#148; and Covington Specialty Insurance Company, or &#147;Covington,&#148; underwrites specialty insurance coverages in the property, umbrella/excess liability, general liability, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability and professional liability lines of business. RSUI also writes a modest amount of reinsurance business on an assumed basis, which is included in the insurance segment. 

The market for specialty insurance coverages differs significantly from the market for standard insurance coverages. The specialty market provides coverage for hard-to-place risks that generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of the standard market which provides coverage for largely uniform and relatively predictable exposures and which is highly regulated with respect to rates and forms. 

RSUI writes specialty business on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable from the admitted insurance markets of a state. Non-admitted insurance is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by insureds&#146; direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. 

RSUI writes specialty business in the admitted specialty market primarily through RIC, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, in the 50 states and the District of Columbia where RIC is licensed and subject to state form and rate regulations. Most of the risks in the admitted specialty market are unique and hard-to-place in the standard market, but must remain with an admitted insurance company for regulatory and/or marketing reasons. As an admitted carrier, RIC is subject to more state regulation than a non-admitted carrier, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. 

RSUI writes business on an approved, non-admitted basis primarily through Landmark, an Oklahoma-domiciled insurer. Landmark, as a non-admitted company, is not subject to state form and rate regulations and thus has more flexibility in its rates and coverages for specialized or hard-to-place risks. This typically results in coverages that are more restrictive and expensive than coverages written by a standard insurance company. As of December 31, 2015, Landmark was approved to write business on a non-admitted basis in 49 states. 

Covington, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, was formed in September 2007 to, among other things, support non-admitted business written primarily by RSUI&#146;s binding authority department, which writes small, specialized coverages pursuant to underwriting authority arrangements with managing general agents. 

&#160;

Pursuant to quota share arrangements, effective as of January 1, 2009, Landmark and Covington cede 90 percent of all their respective premiums and losses, gross of third-party reinsurance, to RIC. 

As of December 31, 2015, the statutory surplus of RIC was approximately $1.5 billion, the statutory surplus of Landmark was $228.7 million, the statutory surplus of Covington was $50.0 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP, and the consolidated equity of RSUI was $1.6 billion, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Distribution. As of December 31, 2015, RSUI conducted its insurance business through approximately 125 independent wholesale insurance brokers located throughout the U.S. and 29 managing general agents. RSUI&#146;s wholesale brokers are appointed on an individual basis based on management&#146;s appraisal of expertise, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent, and the size and experience of the agency, and only specific locations of a wholesale broker&#146;s operations may be appointed to distribute RSUI&#146;s products. Producer agreements which stipulate premium collection, payment terms and commission arrangements are in place with each wholesale broker. No wholesale broker holds underwriting, claims or reinsurance authority. RSUI has entered into underwriting authority arrangements with 29 managing general agents for small, specialized coverages. RSUI&#146;s top five producing wholesale brokers accounted for approximately 64 percent of gross premiums written by RSUI in 2015. RSUI&#146;s top two producing wholesale brokers, CRC Insurance Services, Inc. and AmWINS Group, Inc., accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 35 percent of AIHL&#146;s gross premiums written in 2015. 

Underwriting. RSUI&#146;s underwriting philosophy is based on handling only product lines in which its underwriters have underwriting expertise. RSUI generally focuses on higher severity, lower frequency specialty risks that can be effectively &#147;desk underwritten&#148; without the need for inspection or engineering reviews. RSUI tracks underwriting results for each of its underwriters and believes that the underwriting systems and applications it has in place facilitate efficient underwriting and high productivity levels. Underwriting authority is delegated on a &#147;top-down&#148; basis ultimately to individual underwriters based on experience and expertise. This authority is in writing and addresses maximum limits, excluded classes and coverages and premium size referral. Referral to a product line manager is required for risks exceeding an underwriter&#146;s authority. 

Ratings. RIC is rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best. Landmark and Covington are rated A+ (Superior) on a reinsured basis by A.M. Best, all three companies are rated &#147;A&#148; by S&#38;P, and on January 27, 2016, Moody&#146;s upgraded RIC and Landmark to A2 from A3. 

CapSpecialty 

General. CapSpecialty, primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Capitol Indemnity Corporation, or &#147;CIC,&#148; Capitol Specialty Insurance Corporation, or &#147;CSIC,&#148; and Platte River Insurance Company, or &#147;Platte River,&#148; operates in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. CapSpecialty also includes the operations and results of Professional Risk Management Services, Inc., which was acquired from TransRe effective January 1, 2014. 

CIC conducts its property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis throughout the country. CIC also writes surety products such as commercial surety bonds and contract surety bonds on a national basis. Commercial surety bonds include all surety bonds other than contract surety bonds and cover obligations typically required by law or regulation, such as licenses and permits. CIC offers contract surety bonds in the non-construction segment of the market which secure performance under supply, service and maintenance contracts. 

CSIC conducts substantially all of its business on an approved, non-admitted basis nationally and writes primarily specialty lines of property and casualty insurance, including the professional lines of business. 

Platte River is licensed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and operates in conjunction with CIC primarily providing surety products and offering pricing flexibility in those jurisdictions where both CIC and Platte River are licensed. 

Effective January 1, 2014, CapSpecialty was recapitalized pursuant to a series of transactions which included the exchange by AIHL of its common stock in CapSpecialty for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock carrying a seven percent preference, or the &#147;Preferred Stock,&#148; and the subsequent sale by AIHL to TransRe of 

&#160;

24.9 percent of the Preferred Stock for a cash purchase price based on CapSpecialty&#146;s December 31, 2013 GAAP book value. At the same time, CapSpecialty reserved shares of restricted common stock, or the &#147;Restricted Stock,&#148; which are subordinate to the Preferred Stock, for issuance to the management of CapSpecialty pursuant to a restricted stock plan. To the extent all shares of Restricted Stock are vested and issued, the Restricted Stock will represent 20 percent of the value of CapSpecialty in excess of the Preferred Stock and its cumulative preference. 

In the third quarter of 2015, AIHL Re and CapSpecialty (specifically, the insurance subsidiaries of CapSpecialty) entered into an intercompany reinsurance contract, effective July 1, 2015, pursuant to which AIHL Re will provide CapSpecialty with coverage primarily for adverse development on net loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses, or &#147;LAE,&#148; for accident years 2014 and prior in excess of its carried reserves at June 30, 2015. AIHL Re&#146;s commitments are intended to cover the statutory collateral requirements at CapSpecialty, if and when necessary, and AIHL Re&#146;s obligations are subject to an aggregate limit of $50.0 million. See Note 5(e) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; of this Form 10-K for additional detail on the reinsurance contract. 

As of December 31, 2015, the statutory surplus of CIC was $225.5 million, which included the statutory surplus of CSIC of $53.8 million and the statutory surplus of Platte River of $42.2 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP. As of December 31, 2015, the consolidated equity of CapSpecialty was $312.6 million, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Distribution. CapSpecialty conducts its insurance business through independent wholesale brokerage and retail agents and general insurance agents located throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, CapSpecialty had approximately 137 independent wholesale brokerage and retail agents and 69 general agents licensed to write property and casualty and surety coverages, approximately 116 agents specializing in professional liability coverages and approximately 279 independent agents licensed only to write surety coverages. The general agents write very little surety business and have full quoting and binding authority within the parameters of their agency contracts with respect to the property and casualty business that they write. Certain independent agents have binding authority for specific business owner policy products, including property and liability coverages, and non-contract surety products. No agent of CapSpecialty had writings in excess of 4.9 percent of CapSpecialty&#146;s gross premiums written in 2015. 

Underwriting. Elements of CapSpecialty&#146;s underwriting process include prudent risk selection, appropriate pricing and coverage customization. All accounts are reviewed on an individual basis to determine underwriting acceptability. CapSpecialty is a subscriber to the Insurance Service Organization, or &#147;ISO,&#148; and the Surety and Fidelity Association of America, or &#147;SFAA,&#148; insurance reference resources recognized by the insurance industry. CapSpecialty&#146;s underwriting procedures, rates and contractual coverage obligations are based on procedures and data developed by the ISO for property and casualty lines and by the SFAA for surety lines. Underwriting acceptability is determined by type of business, claims experience, length of time in business and business experience, age and condition of premises occupied and financial stability. Information is obtained from, among other sources, agent applications, financial reports and on-site loss control surveys. If an account does not meet pre-determined acceptability parameters, coverage is declined. If an in-force policy becomes unprofitable due to extraordinary claims activity or inadequate premium levels, a non-renewal notice is issued in accordance with individual state statutes and rules. 

Ratings. CIC, CSIC and Platte River are rated A (Excellent) on a reinsured basis by A.M. Best. 

PacificComp 

General. Prior to June 2009, PacificComp&#146;s main business was workers&#146; compensation insurance, which was conducted on a direct basis through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pacific Compensation Insurance Company, or &#147;PCIC.&#148; In June 2009, PacificComp determined that it was unable to write business at rates it deemed adequate due to the state of the California workers&#146; compensation market. As a result, PacificComp ceased soliciting new or renewal business on a direct basis commencing August 1, 2009, and took corresponding 

&#160;

expense reduction steps, including staff reductions. During the 2009 third quarter, PacificComp sold the renewal rights of its directly placed workers&#146; compensation insurance policies and certain other assets and rights to an independent insurance brokerage. As part of a strategic repositioning effort, effective April 12, 2010, PacificComp took steps to emerge as a writer, through PCIC, of workers&#146; compensation insurance distributed through independent insurance brokers. PacificComp began writing a modest amount of new business through brokers during 2011. This business has increased since 2011, reflecting PacificComp&#146;s distribution initiatives and increased market acceptance of PacificComp&#146;s product offerings. PCIC is currently licensed in California and six additional states. 

In the second quarter of 2013, AIHL Re and PCIC entered into an intercompany reinsurance contract, effective January 1, 2013, pursuant to which AIHL Re provides PCIC with coverage for adverse development on net loss and allocated LAE in excess of PCIC&#146;s carried reserves at December 31, 2012 and accident year stop-loss coverage for any net losses and allocated LAE in excess of 75.0 percent of net premiums earned for PCIC for accident years 2013 through 2017. AIHL Re&#146;s commitments also are intended to cover the statutory collateral requirements at PCIC, if and when necessary. AIHL Re&#146;s obligations are subject to an aggregate limit of $100.0 million. See Note 5(e) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; of this Form 10-K for additional detail on the reinsurance contract. 

As of December 31, 2015, the statutory surplus of PCIC was $87.1 million, as determined in accordance with SAP, and the consolidated equity of PacificComp was $94.1 million, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Rating. PCIC is rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best. 

Reserves 

Each of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries establishes reserves on its balance sheet for unpaid loss and LAE related to its property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts. The reserves for loss and LAE represent management&#146;s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The process of estimating these reserves is inherently difficult and involves a considerable degree of judgment, especially in view of changing legal and economic environments that impact the development of loss reserves. Therefore, quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations and managerial judgment. In addition, conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. See Part II, Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; for additional detail on our critical accounting estimates. 

The following table shows changes in historical net loss and LAE reserves for our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries for each year since 2005. 

The first line of the upper portion of the table shows the net reserves as of December 31 of each of the indicated years, representing the estimated amounts of net outstanding loss and LAE for claims arising during that year and in all prior years that are unpaid, including losses that have been incurred but not yet reported, or &#147;IBNR,&#148; to our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The upper (paid) portion of the table shows the cumulative net amounts paid as of December 31 of successive years with respect to the net reserve liability for each year. 

The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded net reserves for each year based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about claims for individual years. In evaluating the information in the table, it should be noted that a reserve amount reported in any period includes the effect of any subsequent change in such reserve amount. For example, if a loss was first reserved in 2006 at $100,000 and was determined in 2015 to be $150,000, the $50,000 deficiency would be included in the Cumulative (Deficiency) Redundancy row shown below for the year 2006. 

Conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past may not be indicative of future developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

Asbestos-Related Illness and Environmental Impairment Reserves 

Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries&#146; reserves for loss and LAE include amounts for risks relating to asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment. The reserves carried for such claims, including the IBNR portion, are based upon known facts and current law at the respective balance sheet dates. However, significant uncertainty exists in determining the amount of ultimate liability for asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment losses, particularly for those occurring in 1985 and prior, which prior to the Commutation Agreement, as defined below, represented the majority of TransRe&#146;s asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment reserves. This uncertainty is due to inconsistent and changing court resolutions and judicial interpretations with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages, among other reasons. Further, possible future changes in statutes, laws, regulations, theories of liability and other factors could have a material effect on these liabilities and, accordingly, future earnings. Although we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves, which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, may be necessary in the future, we believe that our asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment reserves are adequate as of December 31, 2015. 

On November 30, 2015, TransRe entered into a commutation and release agreement with AIG Property Casualty, Inc., National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc. with respect to certain reinsurance contracts, or the &#147;Commutation Agreement,&#148; including contracts covering asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment liabilities for 1986 and prior years, or the &#147;Commuted A&#38;E Liabilities.&#148; Pursuant to the Commutation Agreement, TransRe made a settlement payment of $400.0 million in 2015 to terminate certain liabilities and obligations, including for the Commuted A&#38;E Liabilities, which eliminated the vast majority of its asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment loss and LAE reserves. As a result of the Commutation Agreement, TransRe incurred $38.2 million ($24.8 million after-tax) of unfavorable prior accident year development in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, gross and net loss and LAE reserves for asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment liabilities were as follows:

&#160; As of December 31, 2015, the reserves for asbestos-related illness liabilities were approximately eight times the average paid claims for the prior three year period, compared with 12 times as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the reserves for environmental impairment liabilities were approximately 5 times the average paid claims for the prior three year period, compared with ten times as of December 31, 2014. The December 31, 2015 figures were adjusted for the Commutation Agreement.

(1) Paid losses include commutations and legal settlements as well as regular paid losses. Amounts for 2015 include amounts paid by TransRe pursuant to the Commutation Agreement for the Commuted A&#38;E Liabilities. Catastrophe Risk Management 

The business of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries exposes them to losses from various catastrophe events. In a catastrophe event, losses from many insureds across multiple lines of business may result directly or indirectly from such single occurrence. The extent of losses caused by catastrophes is a function of the amount and type of insured exposure in the area affected by the event, as well as the severity of the event, potentially mitigated by any reinsurance coverage purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries take certain measures to mitigate the impact of catastrophe events through various means including considering catastrophe risks in their underwriting and pricing decisions, purchasing reinsurance, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and managing exposure in key geographic zones and product lines that are prone to catastrophe events. 

&#160;

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, other windstorms, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to materially and adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, a major terrorist event, the bankruptcy of a major company, or a marine or an aviation disaster, could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 

We evaluate catastrophe events and assess the probability of occurrence and magnitude through the use of industry recognized models and other techniques. In addition, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries use modeled loss scenarios and internal analyses to set risk retention levels and help structure their reinsurance programs in an effort to ensure that the aggregate amount of catastrophe exposures conform to established risk tolerances and fit within the existing exposure portfolio. We supplement these models by judgmentally interpreting and adjusting when appropriate the modeled output and by monitoring the exposure risks of our operations. There is no single standard methodology to project possible losses from catastrophe exposures. Further, there are no industry standard assumptions used in projecting these losses, and the form and quality of the data obtained, including data obtained from insureds and ceding companies, and used in these models are not uniformly compatible with the data requirements of all models. Therefore, the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Finally, these modeled losses may not be comparable with estimates made by other companies. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries also use reinsurance to further limit their exposure to catastrophes, as is discussed in more detail under &#147;Reinsurance Protection&#148; below. 

Reinsurance Protection 

Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite in order to reduce the effect of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, manage capacity, protect capital resources, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and enable them to increase gross premium writings and risk capacity without requiring additional capital. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance and retrocessional coverages from highly-rated third-party reinsurers. If the assuming reinsurers are unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the applicable reinsurance agreements, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries would remain liable for such reinsurance portion not paid by these reinsurers. As such, funds, trust agreements and letters of credit are held to collateralize a portion of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries&#146; reinsurance recoverables, and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite or assume with multiple reinsurance programs. 

To a limited extent, TransRe enters into retrocession arrangements, including property catastrophe retrocession arrangements, in order to reduce the effect of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns and increase gross premium writings and risk capacity without requiring additional capital. 

RSUI reinsures its property lines of business through a program consisting of surplus share treaties, facultative placements, per risk and catastrophe excess-of-loss treaties. RSUI&#146;s catastrophe reinsurance program (which covers catastrophe risks including, among others, windstorms and earthquakes) and per risk reinsurance program run on an annual basis from May 1 to the following April 30 and portions expired on April 30, 2015. 

RSUI&#146;s catastrophe reinsurance program covers catastrophe risks including, among others, windstorms and earthquakes. Portions of the catastrophe reinsurance program include multi-year terms, some of which were entered into in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the catastrophe reinsurance program consisted of three layers, with the first two layers placed on May 1, 2015 and the third layer placed on May 1, 2014. The catastrophe reinsurance program provides coverage for $600.0 million of losses in excess of a $200.0 million net retention after application of surplus share treaties and facultative reinsurance. The first layer provides coverage for $300.0 million of losses, subject to a 5.0 percent co-participation by RSUI in excess of $200.0 million, the second layer provides coverage for $100.0 million of losses in excess of $500.0 million, with no co-participation by RSUI, and the third layer provides coverage for $200.0 million of losses in excess of $600.0 million, with no co-participation by RSUI. The first and second layers of coverage include expiration terms as follows: 34.0 percent 

&#160;

of coverage limits will expire on April 30, 2016; 33.0 percent of coverage limits will expire on April 30, 2017; and 33.0 percent of coverage limits will expire on April 30, 2018. The third layer of coverage will expire on April 30, 2017. 

In addition, RSUI&#146;s property per risk reinsurance program runs on an annual basis from May 1 to the following April 30 and thus expired on April 30, 2015. On May 1, 2015, the property per risk program was renewed and will expire on April 30, 2016. For the 2015 to 2016 period, RSUI&#146;s property per risk reinsurance program provides coverage for $90.0 million of losses, subject to a 10.0 percent co-participation by RSUI, in excess of a $10.0 million net retention per risk after application of surplus share treaties and facultative reinsurance. 

With respect to potential losses arising from acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as extended and amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which we collectively refer to as the &#147;Terrorism Act,&#148; established a program to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry in order to meet the needs of commercial insurance policyholders for coverages against losses due to certain acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Act fixes the insurer deductible at 20 percent of an insurer&#146;s direct earned premium of the preceding calendar year and the federal share of compensation at 85 percent of insured losses that exceed insurer deductibles, but only until January 1, 2016, at which time the federal share shall decrease by 1 percentage point per calendar year until equal to 80 percent. The Terrorism Act is administered by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. 

The Terrorism Act applies to foreign or domestic acts of terrorism occurring within the U.S. (including in the U.S. territorial sea and the Outer Continental Shelf), at U.S. missions abroad or on U.S. flag vessels or aircraft. In return for requiring insurers writing certain lines of property and casualty insurance to offer coverage to commercial insurance policyholders against specified acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Act requires the U.S. federal government to reimburse such insurers for the federal share (initially set at 85 percent, as described above) of insured losses during a program year resulting from such acts of terrorism above a statutorily-defined deductible. In addition, federal reimbursement will only be paid under the Terrorism Act if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from the covered act of terrorism exceed $100.0 million for insured losses occurring in 2015, but no payment will be made for any portion of aggregate industry insured losses that exceeds $100.0 billion in 2015. The $100.0 million threshold gradually increases to $200.0 million by 2020. 

The coverage provided by the Terrorism Act does not apply to reinsurers. In general, TransRe does not provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act, but it is nonetheless exposed to potential losses from both certified and uncertified acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere. In addition, TransRe offers terrorism-specific treaty coverages to ceding companies and terrorism risk pools outside of the United States on a limited basis. With respect to other lines of business, TransRe assumes terrorism risk in marine, aviation and other casualty treaties after careful underwriting consideration and, in many cases, with limitations. Potential losses from acts of terrorism could be material depending on the nature and location of the act. 

Approximately 3 percent of all policies and approximately 13 percent of property policies written by RSUI in 2015 contained coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI uses various underwriting strategies to mitigate its exposure to terrorism losses. In addition, its casualty reinsurance programs provide coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI&#146;s property reinsurance programs provide coverage only for domestic acts of terrorism and, as a result, RSUI is liable for losses under property policies that provide coverage for foreign acts of terrorism, subject to potential Terrorism Act reimbursement. 

We have established a Reinsurance Security Committee, which includes certain of our officers and the chief financial officers of each of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, who meet to track, analyze and manage the use of reinsurance by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The Reinsurance Security Committee considers and oversees the limits on the maximum amount of unsecured reinsurance recoverables that should be outstanding from any particular reinsurer, the lines of business that should be ceded to a particular reinsurer and, where applicable, the types of collateral that should be posted by reinsurers. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had total reinsurance recoverables of $1,249.9 million, consisting of $1,169.3 million of ceded outstanding loss and LAE and $80.6 million of recoverables on paid losses. The reinsurance purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries does not relieve them from their obligations to their policyholders and cedants, and therefore, the financial strength of their reinsurers is important. Approximately 95 percent of our reinsurance recoverables balance as of December 31, 2015 was due from reinsurers having an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Excellent) or higher. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as of December 31, 2015. Information related to concentration of reinsurance recoverables can be found in Part II, Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Reinsurance Recoverables&#148; of this Form 10-K and Note 5(b) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; of this Form 10-K. Information regarding the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries with respect to their use of reinsurance can be found on pages 56 and 57 of this Form 10-K. 

Competition 

The reinsurance and insurance industry is highly competitive, and industry consolidation has created an even more competitive business environment. Competition in the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the company, premiums charged, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written. 

Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers and insurers in their selected lines of business, including regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, government-owned or subsidized facilities, European underwriting syndicates and diversified financial services companies. In our reinsurance segment, TransRe&#146;s property and casualty businesses compete on a worldwide basis. In our insurance segment, RSUI&#146;s property and casualty businesses, and CapSpecialty&#146;s admitted property and casualty businesses and surety and non-admitted specialty businesses, compete on a national basis, and PacificComp&#146;s workers&#146; compensation insurance business competes primarily in California. Some of these competitors have significantly more premiums, capital and resources than our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. 

In addition to competition from the reinsurance industry, TransRe faces competition from the capital markets, as well as some traditional reinsurers, which from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as collateralized reinsurance, reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds and various derivatives, such as swaps and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Hedge funds may also provide reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry. 

A discussion of the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries due to competition within, and the cyclicality of, the reinsurance and insurance business can be found on pages 55 and 56 of this Form 10-K.

General 

Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies, although the degree and type of regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We expect the scope and extent of regulation globally, as well as regulatory oversight generally, to continue to increase. 

U.S. Regulation 

Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they are licensed to conduct business. The extent of this regulation varies, but state insurance laws and regulations generally govern the market conduct and financial condition of reinsurers and insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentrations of permissible investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy. In addition, state insurance laws and regulations govern the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling, and require the approval of nearly all rates, policy forms and related materials for lines of insurance. We anticipate that U.S jurisdictions will make some movement towards a harmonized regulatory environment at the state level through solvency modernization efforts. 

Through state &#147;credit for reinsurance&#148; laws, our reinsurance companies are indirectly subject to the effects of regulatory requirements imposed by the states in which their ceding insurers are domiciled and/or licensed. In general, an insurer that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed, accredited, authorized or approved by the state in which the insurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to take a credit on its statutory financial statements in an aggregate amount equal to all of the reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and the liabilities for unearned premiums and loss and LAE reserves ceded to the reinsurer, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, certain states allow credit to be taken for the amount ceded to a non-U.S. reinsurer domiciled in a country recognized as a &#147;qualified jurisdiction&#148; (based upon an assessment of the strength of such jurisdiction&#146;s supervisory structure) that is designated by the state as a &#147;certified reinsurer.&#148; In such instances the ceding company is permitted to take a credit on its statutory financial statements in an aggregate amount equal to all of the reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and the liabilities for unearned premiums and loss and LAE reserves ceded to the reinsurer, subject to certain limitations provided the reinsurer posts acceptable security in an amount that varies in proportion to the reinsurer&#146;s ratings (A.M. Best, S&#38;P, Moody&#146;s and/or Fitch Ratings Inc.). Finally, for reinsurance ceded to reinsurers that are not licensed, accredited, authorized, approved or certified in the ceding company&#146;s jurisdiction, the reinsurer must agree to post 100 percent qualified security, either in the form of a deposit, trust or letter of credit, in order that the ceding insurer be allowed to take full 

&#160;

credit on its statutory financial statements in an aggregate amount equal to all or a portion of the reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and the liabilities for unearned premiums and loss and LAE reserves ceded to such reinsurers. 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation. As an insurance holding company, we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws enacted in those states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or where they conduct business. These laws generally require an insurance holding company and its reinsurer and insurer subsidiaries to register with their respective insurance regulators and to file with those regulators certain reports, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, including dividends and distributions, and general business operations. The insurance holding company laws of some states, including with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions, may be more restrictive than the insurance holding company laws of other states. 

Under the insurance holding company laws and regulations, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may not pay an &#147;extraordinary&#148; dividend or distribution, or pay a dividend except out of earned surplus, without the approval of state insurance regulators. In general, an &#147;extraordinary&#148; dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater (or, in some jurisdictions, the lesser) of (i) 10 percent of the insurer&#146;s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year, and (ii) the adjusted statutory net investment income during the prior calendar year. 

In addition, insurance holding company laws and regulations to which we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject generally require prior notification and approval or non-disapproval by the applicable insurance regulators of certain other significant transactions, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements between an insurer subsidiary, on the one hand, and its holding company or other subsidiaries of the holding company, on the other hand. 

The insurance holding company laws and regulations of the states in which our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled also generally require that, before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of a reinsurer or an insurer domiciled in the state, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurer&#146;s domiciliary state insurance regulator. The state insurance regulators are required to consider various factors, including the financial strength of the acquirer, the integrity and management experience of the acquirer&#146;s board of directors and executive officers, and the acquirer&#146;s plans for the future operations of the reinsurer or insurer. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, &#147;control&#148; over a reinsurer or an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of that reinsurer or insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of the ultimate controlling person&#146;s common stock. 

The acquisition of control laws described above may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. 

NAIC Solvency Modernization Initiative. During the past few years, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the &#147;NAIC,&#148; engaged in a Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance regulatory framework regarding solvency issues, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and credit for reinsurance. As part of this initiative, in December 2010, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, or the &#147;Amended Model Act and Regulation.&#148; The Amended Model Act and Regulation introduces, among other things, the concept of &#147;enterprise&#148; risk within an insurance holding company system. The Amended Model Act and Regulation imposes more extensive informational requirements on the ultimate controlling person of the reinsurer or insurer with the purpose of protecting such reinsurer or insurer from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person of the reinsurer or insurer that identifies the material risks within the insurance holding company system 

&#160;

that could pose enterprise risk to the reinsurer or insurer. The Amended Model Act and Regulation must be adopted by the individual states, and specifically the states in which our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, for the new requirements to apply. It is not clear when all U.S. states will adopt these changes; however, the Amended Model Act and Regulation must be adopted by an individual state in order for the new requirements to apply to reinsurers and insurers domiciled in that state. As of December 31, 2015, most U.S. states had adopted such legislation, including most of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Because the NAIC has identified certain provisions of the Amended Model Act and Regulation which will be required to be adopted by the states in order for them to maintain NAIC accreditation, it is expected that the Amended Model Act and Regulation will be adopted in full or substantial part by all or almost all states during 2016. 

Risk Management and ORSA. In September 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Model Act, or the &#147;ORSA Model Act.&#148; The ORSA Model Act requires reinsurers and insurers that exceed specified premium thresholds to maintain a framework for managing the risks associated with their entire holding company group, including non-insurance companies. In addition, at least annually, the reinsurer or insurer must prepare a summary report, or the &#147;ORSA Report,&#148; regarding its internal assessment of risk management and capital adequacy for the entire holding company group. The ORSA Report will be filed, on a confidential basis, with the insurance holding company group&#146;s lead regulator and made available to other domiciliary regulators within the holding company group. The first filing under the ORSA Model Act occurred in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the ORSA Model Act has been adopted in approximately 36 states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, and legislation was pending or under consideration in several other states. Because the NAIC is seeking to require that the provisions of the ORSA Model Act be adopted by the states in order for them to maintain their NAIC accreditation, the ORSA Model Act is expected to be adopted in full or substantial part by all or most of the states over the next several years. 

Corporate Governance . The NAIC continues to adopt new model laws and regulations that began as part of the NAIC&#146;s Solvency Modernization Initiative. In November 2014, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation, which, following enactment at the state level, will require insurers and reinsurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices. 

Group Supervision and Group Capital. In response to international developments, the NAIC has begun the process of establishing procedures for the supervision of domestic and international insurance groups, including those groups with both insurance and non-insurance entities. In December 2014, the NAIC also adopted further amendments to the Amended Model Act and Regulation, which, following enactment at the state level, would authorize U.S. regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. The NAIC previously designated certain states as the group supervisor for all reporting domestic insurance groups. Additionally, the NAIC is in the early stages of developing a standard set of guidelines for the calculation of group capital requirements to supplement the current entity based capital standards. While it is early in the process, it is anticipated that the new requirements will incorporate existing risk-based capital requirements, or the &#147;RBC,&#148; which is used in the U.S. (discussed in further detail below). 

Rates and Policy Forms. Our insurance companies&#146; policy forms and various premium rates and rates for property or casualty or surety insurance policies are subject to regulation in every state in which they conduct business. In many states, rates and policy forms must be filed with the applicable insurance regulator prior to their use, and in some states, rates and forms must be affirmatively approved by the applicable insurance regulator prior to use. 

The rates and coverage terms of reinsurance agreements with non-affiliates are generally not subject to regulation by any governmental authority. As a practical matter, however, the rates charged by primary insurers and the policy terms of primary insurance agreements may affect the rates charged and the policy terms under associated reinsurance agreements. 

&#160;

Market Conduct Examinations. The insurance laws and regulations to which our insurance companies are subject govern their marketplace activities, affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaint and claims handling. These provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations. Such insurance laws and regulations also govern the licensing of insurance companies and agents and regulate trade practices. 

Periodic Financial Reporting and Risk-Based Capital. Reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. are required to report their financial condition and results of operations in accordance with SAP prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the NAIC. State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial examinations of reinsurers and insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for permissible types and amounts of investments and require minimum capital and surplus levels. These statutory capital and surplus requirements include RBC rules promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in a reinsurance or an insurance company&#146;s business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, a company&#146;s RBC requirements are calculated and compared with its total adjusted capital to determine whether the company may be undercapitalized, and whether regulatory intervention is warranted. As of December 31, 2015, the total adjusted capital of our U.S. domiciled reinsurance and insurance companies exceeded the minimum levels required under RBC rules, and each had excess capacity to write additional premiums in relation to these requirements. Specifically, as of December 31, 2015, the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements was not significant in relation to our actual statutory capital and surplus. 

The NAIC annually calculates certain statutory financial ratios for most reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. These calculations are known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or &#147;IRIS,&#148; ratios. There presently are thirteen IRIS ratios, with each ratio having an established &#147;usual range&#148; of results. The IRIS ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio falling outside the usual range is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. The NAIC reports the ratios to state insurance departments who may then contact a company if four or more of its ratios fall outside the NAIC&#146;s usual ranges. Based upon calculations as of December 31, 2015, PCIC had four of its ratios falling outside the NAIC&#146;s usual ranges, due primarily to PCIC&#146;s premium growth and underwriting loss. 

Guarantee Associations and Similar Arrangements. Certain U.S. insurance companies are required under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Our U.S. insurance companies also are required to participate in various involuntary pools, principally involving workers&#146; compensation and windstorms. 

Statutory Accounting Principles. State insurance regulators have developed SAP as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurers. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer&#146;s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, SAP focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of an insurer at financial reporting dates in accordance with applicable insurance laws and regulations in the state in which such insurer is domiciled. SAP determines, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries and thus determines, in part, the amount of funds they have available to pay as dividends. 

GAAP is concerned with a company&#146;s solvency, but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management&#146;s stewardship of assets than does SAP. Due 

&#160;

to differences in methodology between SAP and GAAP, the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. 

The NAIC has indicated it will consider policy positions regarding the new International Financial Reporting Standard, or &#147;IFRS,&#148; and its inclusion or exclusion from the U.S. framework of insurance solvency regulation and on the regulatory impacts of non-regulatory uses of statutory financial statements after completion of the insurance contracts joint project of the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the &#147;FASB,&#148; and the SEC has made a decision regarding IFRS as a U.S. accounting standard for public companies. The potential outcomes identified by the NAIC include but are not limited to the replacement of SAP with GAAP with statutory adjustments or adoption of IFRS without adjustments. We will continue to monitor these developments and the impact they may have on our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. 

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. As discussed in more detail under &#147;Reinsurance Protection&#148; above, the Terrorism Act established a federal assistance program to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims arising from terrorism-related losses and regulates the terms of insurance relating to the terrorism coverage provided by our insurance companies. 

On July 21, 2010, President Barack H. Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act.&#148; The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations. In addition to introducing sweeping reform of the U.S. financial services industry, the Dodd-Frank Act adopts certain changes to U.S. insurance regulation in general, and to non-admitted insurance and reinsurance in particular. While the Dodd-Frank Act does not result in the federal regulation of insurance, it does establish federal measures that will impact the reinsurance and insurance business and preempt certain state insurance measures. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act incorporates the Non-Admitted and Reinsurance Reform Act, or the &#147;NRRA,&#148; which became effective on July 21, 2011. Among other things, the NRRA established national uniform standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurance (and also sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance). In particular, the NRRA gives regulators in the state where an insurer is domiciled exclusive authority to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance transactions, and regulators in a ceding insurer&#146;s state of domicile are given the sole responsibility for regulating the balance sheet credit that the ceding insurer may take for reinsurance recoverables. At the present time, it is unclear what effect the NRRA changes specific to non-admitted insurance and reinsurance will have on our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, and there is still significant uncertainty as to how these and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented in practice. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or &#147;FSOC,&#148; to identify and respond to risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and to promote market discipline. FSOC is authorized to designate a nonbank financial company as &#147;systemically significant&#148; if its material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the U.S. In 2013, FSOC designated three nonbank financial companies, including two insurance groups, as systemically significant and, in 2014, FSOC designated a third insurance group as systemically significant. Those designated entities will be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as well as enhanced prudential standards, including stress tests, liquidity requirements, annual resolution plans or &#147;living wills,&#148; and enhanced public disclosures. FSOC&#146;s potential recommendation of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our insurance and reinsurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office, or the &#147;FIO,&#148; within the U.S. Department of Treasury, which is designed to promote national coordination within the insurance sector and which has the authority, in part, to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of reinsurers and insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system. Although the FIO is intended principally to exercise a monitoring and information 

&#160;

gathering role, it does have the authority to enter into &#147;Covered Agreements&#148; with regulatory authorities outside the U.S. with respect to certain agreements with foreign governments regarding the supervision and regulation of the global reinsurance and insurance markets. In implementing such international agreements, the FIO has the authority to preempt state law if it is determined that state law is inconsistent with the agreement and treats a non-U.S. reinsurer or insurer less favorably than a U.S. reinsurer or insurer. 

On November 20, 2015 the FIO and the U.S. Trade Representative formally notified the U.S. Congress of their intent to initiate negotiation of a covered agreement with the European Union, or the &#147;EU,&#148; between the U.S. and the EU. The notification stated that the negotiations will &#147;seek to address the following prudential measures: (1) obtain treatment of the U.S. insurance regulatory system by the EU as &#147;equivalent&#148;; (2) obtain recognition by the EU of the integrated state and federal insurance regulatory and oversight system in the U.S. with respect to group supervision; (3) facilitate the exchange of confidential regulatory information between lead supervisors across national borders; (4) afford nationally uniform treatment of EU-based reinsurers operating in the U.S., including with respect to collateral requirements; and (5) obtain permanent equivalent treatment for the solvency regime in the U.S. and applicable to insurance and reinsurance undertakings.&#148; The exact timing for commencement of negotiations has not been publicized. In December 2013, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FIO released a report regarding the modernization and improvement of the U.S. insurance regulatory system. While noting that the current state-based system of insurance regulation is inherently limited in its ability to regulate uniformly and efficiently, the report expresses the FIO&#146;s view that, in the short term, U.S. insurance regulation can be modernized and improved by a combination of steps to be taken by the states in order to increase consistency and transparency of regulation, and certain federal actions, particularly directed to representing U.S. interests in discussions and proceedings with foreign regulators concerning global insurance issues. However, the report also cautions that if the states do not act expeditiously to regulate matters on a more consistent and cooperative basis, there will be a greater role for federal regulation. 

In December 2014, FIO delivered its report to the U.S. Congress describing the global reinsurance market and its critical role in supporting the U.S. insurance system. The report does not assess whether reinsurance or any particular reinsurer could be systemically important. However, the report notes the importance of the global reinsurance market to U.S. reinsurers. It is possible FIO will, in the future, issue recommendations in respect of the reinsurance market that would, if enacted, potentially impact negatively our business. 

The Dodd-Frank Act gave federal agencies significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated multiple studies and reports for the U.S. Congress, including the FIO reports described above, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act or any related additional legislation, the additional costs resulting from compliance with such regulations or legislation or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. 

In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives currently under consideration may significantly affect our reinsurance and insurance business in a variety of ways. These measures include, among other things, tort reform, consumer privacy requirements and proposals for the establishment of state or federal catastrophe funds. The impact of Super Storm Sandy, which caused widespread property damage and flooding to large areas of the East Coast and the Northeastern U.S. in October 2012, has resulted in increased calls for state and federal legislative and regulatory intervention in the reinsurance and insurance business, especially in catastrophe prone areas. We are not able to assess the impact that any such future legislative or regulatory changes may have upon our reinsurance and insurance business. 

International Regulation 

General. TransRe is regulated in various foreign jurisdictions where it conducts business. In certain jurisdictions, TransRe operates through branches or representative offices of TRC and in other jurisdictions, TransRe has local reinsurance or insurance subsidiaries. TransRe&#146;s subsidiaries TRL in the U.K. and TRZ in Switzerland comprise the largest component of TransRe&#146;s international operations. 

&#160;

The extent of the regulation varies by foreign jurisdiction, but generally governs licensing requirements, solvency, currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves and amount and type of local investments. International operations and assets held abroad may be materially and adversely affected by economic, political and other developments in foreign countries, including possible changes in foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, unexpected financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose and potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, as well as by the consequences of international hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. Further, regulations governing technical reserves and remittance of balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. 

U.K. Regulation. Prior to December 2013, TransRe&#146;s operations in the U.K. were conducted through a branch of TRC. Since December 2013, TransRe&#146;s operations in the U.K. have been conducted by TRL and TRC&#146;s branch operations in the U.K. TRL and TRC&#146;s branch operations in the U.K. are supervised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority, or the &#147;PRA,&#148; which is responsible, among other things, for regulating the solvency of insurance and reinsurance companies, and the Financial Conduct Authority, or the &#147;FCA,&#148; which is responsible, among other things, for regulating market conduct. The PRA and FCA have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated entity, including the power to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of its rules by authorized firms and approved persons. TRL and TRC&#146;s branch operations in the U.K. are required to maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of the business conducted in accordance with PRA and FCA rules. The calculation of the margin of solvency depends on the type and amount of reinsurance business written. 

Swiss Regulation . TRZ is licensed to carry on reinsurance business in Switzerland. As a result, TRZ is required to comply with the Federal Insurance Supervision Act, the Federal Insurance Supervision Ordinance and the regulations and guidance issued by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or &#147;FINMA.&#148; Some of the significant aspects of the Swiss regulatory framework include complying with capital and solvency, corporate governance, risk management and internal control requirements. In addition, TRZ is subject to annual reporting requirements enacted by FINMA. 

Branch Regulation. TRC operates in a number of other jurisdictions through a series of foreign branches, including branches in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#146;s Republic of China, the U.K., Switzerland and Singapore, and TRZ operates in Dubai through a branch. As a result, TRC and TRZ are required, among other things, to meet local licensing, reserve, currency, investment and capital requirements for these branches. 

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives . Within the EU, the EU Reinsurance Directive of November 2005, or the &#147;Reinsurance Directive,&#148; requires EU member states, or &#147;Member States,&#148; to adopt common standards for authorizing and supervising reinsurance companies that are head-quartered in a Member State. TRC operates within the EU as a &#147;Third Country Reinsurer&#148; under the Reinsurance Directive through a series of foreign branches and on a cross-border basis. Each branch of TRC in the EU is separately authorized by the relevant regulator in the Member State in which it is established. Currently, TRC continues to conduct business within the EU through its foreign branches with no significant impact on its operations. However, TransRe could be materially and adversely affected by rules adopted by a Member State relating to Third Country Reinsurers. For example, TRC may be required to post additional collateral in EU countries or may need to consider restructuring its business in order to comply with the rules adopted in EU countries relating to Third Country Reinsurers. Since 2013, TransRe has been working to mitigate the risks associated with being a Third Country Reinsurer by migrating business originating in the EU from TransRe branches to TRL. 

In addition to the Reinsurance Directive, an EU directive known as &#147;Solvency II&#148; was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2009. Solvency II is a fundamental revision to the current European regulatory regime that seeks to enhance transparency and risk management and encourages a proactive approach to 

&#160;

company solvency. It is built on a risk-based approach to setting capital requirements for reinsurers and insurers. The implementation of Solvency II is dependent upon the adoption of a second directive, known as Omnibus II, the purpose of which is to provide for transitional arrangements for the introduction of the new regulatory regime, and to facilitate the adoption of rules for the implementation of the principles set out in Solvency II. After several delays, Omnibus II was adopted in March 2014 and Solvency II became effective as of January 1, 2016. TransRe could be materially impacted by the implementation of Solvency II depending on the costs associated with implementation by each EU country, any increased capitalization requirements and any costs associated with adjustments to TransRe&#146;s corporate operating structure. The implementation of Solvency II could also materially impact Alleghany on a group-wide basis, since Solvency II affects the calculation of the solvency of international groups which, like Alleghany, conduct reinsurance and insurance operations both inside and outside of the EU. 

In Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, People&#146;s Republic of China and India, emerging markets where TransRe underwrites business on a cross-border basis, local regulations have recently been adopted that may operate to limit, restrict or increase the costs of TransRe&#146;s access to these markets. If this trend continues to spread to other jurisdictions, TransRe&#146;s ability to operate globally may be materially and adversely affected. 

In addition to regulation within the U.S., by the EU and by the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. where TransRe operates, we may be affected by regulatory policies adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, or the &#147;IAIS.&#148; Regulators in more than 200 jurisdictions and approximately 140 countries, representing both established and emerging markets, are working with the IAIS to consider changes to reinsurer and insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system, including non-insurance companies. Current IAIS initiatives include development of a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or &#147;ComFrame,&#148; which has been in progress since 2010. ComFrame is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for internationally active insurance groups, or &#147;IAIGs,&#148; and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. A fourth draft of ComFrame was published during 2014, to be followed by field testing. Since the field testing is expected to result in further modifications to ComFrame, IAIS currently anticipates that ComFrame will be adopted in 2018 and implemented in 2019. In October 2013, IAIS announced that it intends to develop a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard which will be included within ComFrame. When adopted and implemented, ComFrame may impose additional and duplicative supervisory and regulatory costs on our reinsurance and insurance companies. 

Regulatory Convergence 

Regulators within and outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the regulation of multinational insurers by conducting a supervisory college. A supervisory college, as defined by the IAIS, is &#147;a forum for cooperation and communication between the involved supervisors established for the fundamental purpose of facilitating the effectiveness of supervision of entities which belong to an insurance group; facilitating both the supervisor of the group as a whole on a group-wide basis and improving the legal entity supervision of the entities within the insurance group.&#148; We are continuing to assess the impact, if any, such coordination may have on insurance regulation and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. 

Corporate Activities 

Parent Company Operations 

At the parent level, we seek out attractive investment opportunities, including strategic investments in operating companies, delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers at the operating business level, set goals for our operating businesses, assist managers in the achievement of these goals, define risk parameters and appropriate incentives for our operating businesses, and monitor progress against their long-term objectives. 

Roundwood. Our public equity investments, including those held by TransRe&#146;s and AIHL&#146;s operating subsidiaries, are managed primarily by our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Roundwood. For a discussion of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries&#146; investment results, see pages 95 and 96 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Alleghany Capital. We manage, source, execute and monitor our private capital investments, which include SORC, Bourn &#38; Koch, Kentucky Trailer and IPS, primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Capital. Alleghany Capital&#146;s private capital investments include:
