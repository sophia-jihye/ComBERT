BUSINESS 

The Company 

We are a self-administered REIT active in premier office submarkets along the West Coast. We own, develop, acquire and manage real estate assets, consisting primarily of Class A properties in the coastal regions of Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego County, the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Seattle, which we believe have strategic advantages and strong barriers to entry. Class A real estate encompasses attractive and efficient buildings of high quality that are attractive to tenants, are well-designed and constructed with above-average material, workmanship and finishes and are well-maintained and managed. We own our interests in all of our properties through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. We qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). 

Our stabilized portfolio of operating properties was comprised of the following office properties at December 31, 2015 :

% 

Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently under construction or committed for construction, &#8220;lease-up&#8221; properties, real estate assets held for sale and undeveloped land. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we stabilized a development project consisting of two &#32;office buildings encompassing 108,517 &#32;rentable square feet in Hollywood, California, and a development project consisting of two &#160; office buildings encompassing &#32; 339,987 &#160; rentable square feet in Redwood City, California. These projects were included in our stabilized portfolio as of December 31, 2015 . We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define &#8220;lease-up&#8221; properties as properties we recently developed or redeveloped that have not yet reached 95% occupancy and are within one year following cessation of major construction activities. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had one office development project in the &#8220;lease-up&#8221; phase. We also had four &#32;operating properties and one &#32;land parcel classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , the following properties were excluded from our stabilized portfolio:

See Note 4 &#8220;Dispositions and Real Estate Assets Held for Sale&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 

Our stabilized portfolio also excludes our near-term and future development pipeline, which as of December 31, 2015 , was comprised of ten &#32;potential development sites, representing approximately 99 &#32;gross acres of undeveloped land on which we believe we have the potential to develop over 5.0 million &#32;square feet of office space, depending upon economic conditions. 

As of December 31, 2015 , all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of twelve office properties and one &#32;future development project located in the state of Washington. All of our properties and development projects are 100% owned, excluding two office properties owned by Redwood City Partners, LLC, a consolidated subsidiary, and an undeveloped land parcel 

&#32;5 

held at a qualified intermediary for potential future transactions that are intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (&#8220;Section 1031 Exchanges&#8221;) to defer taxable gains on dispositions for federal and state income tax purposes, which have been consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see Note 2 &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). 

We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership of which we owned a 98.1% &#32; common general partnership interest as of &#32; December 31, 2015 . The remaining 1.9% &#32;common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our executive officers and directors. Kilroy Realty Finance, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Finance Partnership and owns a 1.0% &#32;common general partnership interest. The Operating Partnership owns the remaining 99.0% &#32;common limited partnership interest. We conduct substantially all of our development activities through Kilroy Services, LLC (&#8220;KSLLC&#8221;), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. With the exception of the Operating Partnership, Redwood City Partners LLC, all of the Company's subsidiaries are wholly owned.

Business and Growth Strategies 

Growth Strategies . We believe that a number of factors and strategies will enable us to continue to achieve our objectives of long-term sustainable growth in Net Operating Income (defined below) and FFO (defined below) as well as maximization of long-term stockholder value. These factors and strategies include: 

&#8226; 

the quality, geographic location, physical characteristics and operating sustainability of our properties; 

&#8226; 

our ability to efficiently manage our assets as a low cost provider of commercial real estate through our seasoned management team possessing core capabilities in all aspects of real estate ownership, including property management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, and construction and development management; 

&#8226; 

our access to development, redevelopment, acquisition and leasing opportunities as a result of our extensive experience and significant working relationships with major West Coast property owners, corporate tenants, municipalities and landowners given our over 65-year presence in the West Coast markets; 

&#8226; 

our active development program and our extensive future development pipeline of undeveloped land sites (see &#8220;Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Information on Leases Commenced and Executed&#8221; for additional information pertaining to the Company&#8217;s in-process, near-term and future development pipeline); 

&#8226; 

our capital recycling program (see &#8220;Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership&#8221; for additional information pertaining to the Company&#8217;s capital recycling program and related 2015 and 2016 property and land dispositions); 

&#8226; 

our ability to capitalize on inflection points in a real estate cycle to add quality assets to our portfolio at substantial discounts to long-term value, through either acquisition, development or redevelopment; and 

&#8226; 

our strong financial position that has and will continue to allow us to pursue attractive acquisition and development and redevelopment opportunities. 

&#8220;Net Operating Income&#8221; is defined as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, real estate taxes, provision for bad debts and ground leases) before depreciation. &#8220;FFO&#8221; is funds from operations as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (&#8220;NAREIT&#8221;). See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures: Funds From Operations&#8221; for a reconciliation of these measures to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) net income available to common stockholders. 

Operating Strategies . We focus on enhancing long-term growth in Net Operating Income and FFO from our properties by: 

&#8226; 

maximizing cash flow from our properties through active leasing, early renewals and effective property management; 

&#8226; 

structuring leases to maximize returns; 

&#8226; 

managing portfolio credit risk through effective underwriting, including the use of credit enhancements and interests in collateral to mitigate portfolio credit risk; 

&#8226; 

managing operating expenses through the efficient use of internal property management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, and construction and development management functions; 

&#32;7 

&#8226; 

maintaining and developing long-term relationships with a diverse tenant base; 

&#8226; 

managing our properties to offer the maximum degree of utility and operational efficiency to tenants. We offer tenant sustainability programs focused on helping our tenants reduce their energy and water consumption and increase their recycling diversion rates. We also incorporate green lease language into all of our new full-service gross leases, which align tenant and landlord interests on energy, water, and waste efficiency and were honored in 2014 to be part of the inaugural class of Green Lease Leaders, the Institute for Market Transformation's program to encourage green leasing in real estate. 100% of our new full-service gross leases also contain a cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital; 

&#8226; 

building our current development projects to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (&#8220;LEED&#8221;) specifications. All of our development projects are now designed to achieve LEED certification, either LEED Platinum or Gold; 

&#8226; 

actively pursuing LEED certification for over 1.9 million &#32;square feet of office space under construction. During the past few years we have significantly enhanced the sustainability profile of our portfolio, ending 2015 &#32;with 47% of our properties LEED certified and 64% of eligible properties ENERGY STAR certified. During 2015, the Company was recognized for our sustainability efforts with multiple industry leadership awards, including NAREIT&#8217;s 2015 Office Leader in the Light Award and ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award. The company was also recognized by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark as the North American leader in sustainability for the second year in a row, and was ranked first among 155 North American participants across all asset types; 

&#8226; 

continuing to effectively manage capital improvements to enhance our properties&#8217; competitive advantages in their respective markets and improve the efficiency of building systems; 

&#8226; 

enhancing our management team with individuals who have extensive regional experience and are highly knowledgeable in their respective markets; and 

&#8226; 

attracting and retaining motivated employees by providing financial and other incentives to meet our operating and financial goals. 

Development and Redevelopment Strategies . We and our predecessors have developed office properties primarily located in California since 1947. As of December 31, 2015 , our near-term and future development pipeline was comprised of ten &#32;potential development sites, representing approximately 99 &#32;gross acres of undeveloped land on which we believe we have the potential to develop over 5.0 million &#32;square feet of office space, depending upon economic conditions. Our strategy with respect to development is to: 

&#8226; 

maintain a disciplined approach by commencing development when appropriate based on market conditions, favoring pre-leasing, developing in stages or phasing, and cost control; 

&#8226; 

be the premier provider of modern and collaborative office buildings on the West Coast with focus on design and environment; 

&#8226; 

reinvest capital from dispositions of selective assets into new state-of-the-market development and acquisition assets with higher cash flow and rates of return; 

&#8226; 

execute on our development projects under construction and our near-term and future development pipeline, including expanding entitlements; and 

&#8226; 

evaluate redevelopment opportunities in supply-constrained markets because such efforts generally achieve similar returns to new development with reduced entitlement risk and shorter construction periods. 

Redevelopment opportunities are those projects in which we spend significant development and construction costs on existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return 

&#32;8 

on the property. We may engage in the additional development or redevelopment of office properties when market conditions support a favorable risk-adjusted return on such development or redevelopment. We expect that our significant working relationships with tenants, municipalities and landowners on the West Coast will give us further access to development and redevelopment opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop or redevelop any of our properties or that we will have access to additional development or redevelopment opportunities. 

Acquisition Strategies. We believe we are well positioned to acquire properties and development and redevelopment opportunities as the result of our extensive experience, strong financial position and ability to access capital. We continue to actively monitor our target markets and to evaluate the acquisition of value add office properties and development and redevelopment opportunities that add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth and that: 

&#8226; 

provide attractive yields and significant potential for growth in cash flow from property operations; 

&#8226; 

present growth opportunities in our existing or other strategic markets; and 

&#8226; 

demonstrate the potential for improved performance through intensive management, repositioning and leasing that should result in increased occupancy and rental revenues. 

Financing Strategies . Our financing policies and objectives are determined by our board of directors. Our goal is to limit our dependence on leverage and maintain a conservative ratio of debt-to-total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2015 , our total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was 26.7% , and our total debt and liquidation value of our preferred equity as a percentage of total market capitalization was 29.1% , &#32;both of which were calculated based on the quoted closing price per share of the Company&#8217;s common stock of $63.28 &#32; on December 31, 2015 &#32;(see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company &#8212;Capitalization&#8221; for additional information). Our financing strategies include: 

&#8226; 

maintaining financial flexibility, including a low secured to unsecured debt ratio, to maximize our ability to access a variety of both public and private capital sources; 

&#8226; 

maintaining a staggered debt maturity schedule in which the maturity dates of our debt are spread over several years to limit risk exposure at any particular point in the capital and credit market cycles; 

&#8226; 

completing financing in advance of the need for capital; and 

&#8226; 

managing interest rate exposure by generally maintaining a greater amount of fixed-rate debt as compared to variable-rate debt. 

We utilize multiple sources of capital, including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, proceeds from the issuance of public or private debt or equity securities and other bank and/or institutional borrowings and dispositions of selective assets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital as needed on terms favorable to us or at all. See the discussion under the caption &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Significant Tenants 

As of December 31, 2015 , our 15 largest tenants in terms of annualized base rental revenues represented approximately 36.9% &#32; of our total annualized base rental revenues, defined as annualized monthly contractual rents from existing tenants as of December 31, 2015 . Annualized base rental revenue includes the impact of straight-lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following: amortization of deferred revenue related tenant-funded tenant improvements, amortization of above/below market rents, amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases and expense reimbursement revenue. 

&#32;9 

For further information on our 15 largest tenants and the composition of our tenant base, see &#8220;Item 2. Properties &#8212;Significant Tenants.&#8221; 

Competition 

We compete with several developers, owners, operators and acquirers of office, undeveloped land and other commercial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Segment and Geographic Financial Information 

During 2015 and 2014, we had one reportable segment, our office properties segment. For information about our office property revenues and long-lived assets and other financial information, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Results of Operations.&#8221; 

As of December 31, 2015 , all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of twelve office properties and one future development project located in the state of Washington. All of our properties and development projects are 100% owned, excluding two office properties owned by Redwood City Partners, LLC, a consolidated subsidiary, and an undeveloped land parcel held at a qualified intermediary for potential future Section 1031 Exchanges, which have been consolidated for financial reporting purposes as variable interest entities (see Note 2 &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 232 people through the Operating Partnership, KSLLC, and Kilroy Realty TRS, Inc. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 

Environmental Regulations and Potential Liabilities 

Government Regulation Relating to the Environment. Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties, and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us. 

&#160; 

Existing conditions at some of our properties . Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all of our properties. We generally obtain these assessments prior to the acquisition of a property and may later update them as required for subsequent financing of the property or as requested by a tenant. Site assessments are generally performed to American Society for Testing and Materials standards then-existing for Phase I site assessments and typically include a historical review, a public records review, a visual inspection of the surveyed site, and the issuance of a written report. These assessments do not generally include any soil samplings or subsurface investigations; however, if a Phase 1 does recommend that soil samples be taken or other subsurface investigations take place, we generally perform such recommended actions. Depending on the age of the property, the Phase I may have included an assessment of asbestos-containing materials or a separate hazardous materials survey may have been conducted. For properties where asbestos-containing materials were identified or suspected, an operations and maintenance plan was generally prepared and implemented. 

Historical operations at or near some of our properties, including the presence of underground or above ground storage tanks, may have caused soil or groundwater contamination. In some instances, the prior owners of the affected properties conducted remediation of known contamination in the soils on our properties. Although we may be required to conduct further clean-up of the soil at these properties (see Note 16 &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our ground lease obligations), we are not aware of any such condition, liability, or concern by any other means that would give rise to material environmental liability. However, our assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns; there may be material environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns 

&#32;10 

that arose at a property after the review was completed; future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability; and environmental conditions at our properties may be affected in the future by tenants, third parties, or the condition of land or operations near our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks. We cannot be certain that costs of future environmental compliance will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 

Use of hazardous materials by some of our tenants . Some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations may subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. We generally require our tenants in their leases to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 , other than routine cleaning materials, approximately 5-8% of our tenants handled hazardous substances and/or wastes on approximately 1-3% of the aggregate square footage of our properties as part of their routine operations. These tenants are primarily involved in the life sciences business. The hazardous substances and wastes are primarily comprised of diesel fuel for emergency generators and small quantities of lab and light manufacturing chemicals including, but not limited to, alcohol, ammonia, carbon dioxide, cryogenic gases, dichlorophenol, methane, naturalyte acid, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and oxygen which are routinely used by life science companies. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties, and management does not believe that on-going activities by our tenants will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters . Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation, or disposal of certain hazardous or toxic substances present or released on our properties. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for, or even knew of, the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may have substantial costs, and the presence or release of hazardous substances on a property could result in governmental clean-up actions, personal injury actions, or similar claims by private plaintiffs. 

Potential environmental liabilities may exceed our environmental insurance coverage limits, transactional indemnities or holdbacks . We carry what we believe to be commercially reasonable environmental insurance. Our environmental insurance policies are subject to various terms, conditions and exclusions. Similarly, in connection with some transactions we obtain environmental indemnities and holdbacks that may not be honored by the indemnitors, may be less than the resulting liabilities or may otherwise fail to address the liabilities adequately. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage or transactional indemnities will be sufficient or that our liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.
