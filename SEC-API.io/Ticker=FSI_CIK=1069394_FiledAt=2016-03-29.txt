 Item 1. &#160; Description of Business 

&#160;

We were incorporated as Flexible Solutions Ltd., a British Columbia corporation on January 26, 1991. On May 12, 1998, we merged Flexible Solutions Ltd. into Flexible Solutions International, Inc., a Nevada corporation. In connection with this merger, we issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock to the former shareholders of Flexible Solutions Ltd. in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Flexible Solutions Ltd. 

In June 2004 we purchased 52 U.S. and 139 International patents, as well as a 56,780 sq. ft. manufacturing plant near Chicago, Illinois from the bankruptcy estate of Donlar Corporation (&#8220;Donlar&#8221;) for $6.15 million. The patents we acquired from Donlar relate to water-soluble chemicals (&#8220;TPAs&#8221;) which prevent corrosion and scaling in water pipes used in the petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries. TPAs are also used to enhance fertilizers and improve crop yields and as additives for household laundry detergents, consumer care products and pesticides. 

We operate through a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries which are mentioned in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this report. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to our business include the operations of these subsidiaries.

Our Products 

HEATSAVR&#174;/ECOSAVR 

Our studies indicate that approximately 70% of the energy lost from a swimming pool occurs through water evaporation. HEATSAVR&#174; is a chemical product for use in swimming pools and spas that forms a thin, transparent layer on the water&#8217;s surface. The transparent layer slows the evaporation of water, allowing the water to retain a higher temperature for a longer period of time and thereby reducing the energy required to maintain the desired temperature of the water. We have received reports from our commercial customers documenting energy savings of between $2,400 to $6,000 per year when using HEATSAVR&#174;. 

ECOSAVR&#174; is a patented, disposable dispenser designed for the residential pool and spa market. ECOSAVR&#174; is made of molded plastic in the form of a ten-inch long colorful fish that is filled with enough HEATSAVR&#174; to cover the surface of a 400 sq. ft. swimming pool for about one month. The HEATSAVR&#174; solution inside the ECOSAVR&#174; escapes into the water and rises to the surface to form a transparent layer on the water&#8217;s surface. Once the ECOSAVR&#174; is empty the dispenser is removed and replaced. 

In outdoor pools, the HEATSAVR&#174; also provides convenience compared to pool blankets. Pool blankets are plastic covers which are cut to the size and shape of the surface of the pool or spa. Pool blankets float on the surface and, like the HEATSAVR&#174;, reduce energy costs by inhibiting water evaporation. However, it is often inconvenient to use conventional pool blankets because a pool blanket must be removed and stored before the pool can be used. Pool blankets do not provide any energy savings when not on the pool. Conversely, HEATSAVR&#174; eliminates the need to install, remove and store the blanket and works 24 hours a day. In addition, the use of HEATSAVR&#174; in an indoor pool results in even greater energy savings since indoor pool locations use energy not only to heat the pool water, but also to air condition the pool environment. By slowing the transfer of heat and water vapor from the pool to the atmosphere of the pool enclosure, less energy is required to maintain a pool at the desired temperature and there is a reduced load on the air-conditioning system. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

HEATSAVR&#174; retails for between $250 and $300 per four gallon case in the United States. ECOSAVR&#174; has a suggested retail price of $13.00 in the United States. We market our HEATSAVR&#174; and ECOSAVR&#174; products to homeowners with swimming pools and spas as well as operators of swimming pools and spas in hotels, motels, schools, and municipal and private recreational facilities. 

We also manufacture and sell products which automatically dispense HEATSAVR&#174; into commercial size swimming pools or spas at the rate of one ounce per 400 sq. ft. of water surface per day. 

We have 18 non-exclusive distributorships in Canada and the United States for the sale of bulk HEATSAVR&#174; (without the ECOSAVR&#174; dispenser) and exclusive distributorships in Australia, Chile, Korea, Argentina, South Africa, Taiwan, and parts of Eastern and Western Europe. We support our distributors and seek additional market opportunities by annually attending the major pool industry trade shows in the United States. We also advertise in trade magazines and maintain a website which has information about our products. 

WATERSAVR&#174; 

This product utilizes our HEATSAVR technology to reduce water evaporation in reservoirs, potable water storage tanks, livestock watering ponds, aqueducts, canals and irrigation ditches. WATERSAVR may also be used for lawn and turf care and potted and bedding plants. 

WATERSAVR&#174; is sold in granulated form and can be applied by hand, by fully automated scheduled metering, or by an automatic dispenser.

TPAs (thermal polyaspartate biopolymers) 

TPAs for Oilfields . TPAs are used to reduce scale and corrosion in various &#8220;topside&#8221; water systems. They are used in place of traditional phosphate and other products when biodegradability is required by environmental regulations. We have the ability to custom manufacture TPAs depending on the specific water conditions associated with any oil well. 

TPAs for the Agricultural Industry . TPAs have the ability to reduce fertilizer crystallization before, during and after application and can also prevent crystal formation between fertilizer and minerals present in the soil. Once crystallized, fertilizer and soil minerals are not able to provide plant nourishment. As a result, in select conditions the use of TPAs either blended with fertilizer or applied directly to crops can increase yields significantly. TPAs are designated for crop nutrient management programs and should not be confused with crop protection and pesticides or other agricultural chemical applications. Depending on the application, TPA products are marketed under a variety of brands including Amisorb, LYNX, MAGNET, AmGro and VOLT. Markets of significance include potatoes, sugar beets, cotton, tomatoes, almonds and other high value per acre crops. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

TPAs for Irrigation . The crystallization prevention ability of TPAs can also be useful in select irrigation conditions. By reducing calcium carbonate scale propagation, TPAs can prevent early plugging of drip irrigation ports, reduce maintenance costs and lengthen the life of equipment. TPAs compete with acid type scale removers, but have the advantage of a positive yield effect on the plant, as well as an easier deployment formulation with liquid fertilizers when used as part of a &#8220;fertigation&#8221; program. Our TPAs for drip irrigation scale prevention are at an early stage of commercialization and will be marketed and sold through the same channels as TPAs used by the agricultural industry. 

TPAs for Detergent . In detergents, TPAs are a biodegradable substitute for poly-acrylic acid. In select markets, the use of this substitute outweighs the added cost of TPAs, which has allowed for the continued growth of this TPA product line. However, to increase penetration of this market beyond specialty detergent manufacturers, we will need to decrease the cost of this product or wait for legislative intervention regarding biodegradability of detergent components. In the meantime, we are researching various methods to reduce production costs. 

TPAs for Personal Care Products . TPAs can also be used in shampoo and cosmetic products for increased hydration that improves the feel of the core product to consumers. TPA&#8217;s may also be used as an additive to toothpaste with the documented effect of reducing decay bacteria adhesion to tooth enamel and presumed reduction in total decay. We do not currently sell TPAs for use in personal care products.

Competition 

HEATSAVR&#174; and ECOSAVR&#8482; 

Although we are aware of two other companies that manufacture products that compete with HEATSAVR&#174; and ECOSAVR&#174;, we believe our products are more effective and safer. We maintain fair pricing equal to or lower than our competitors and protect our intellectual property carefully. Our products are expected to maintain or increase market share in the competitive pool market. 

HEATSAVR&#174; also competes with plastic pool blanket products. However, we believe that HEATSAVR&#174; is more effective and convenient than pool blankets. 

WATERSAVR&#174; 

Ultimate Products (Aust) Pty Ltd. of Australia has a product called Aquatain that directly competes with WATERSAVR&#174;. We believe our WATERSAVR&#174; product is superior for the following reasons: it is safer, much less expensive and has much better test data. Aquatain has not expended the capital to test for environmental effects on insects and other aquatic life whereas WATERSAVR&#174; has recognized third party environmental safety documentation. 

&#160;

As water conservation is an important priority throughout the world, numerous researchers are working to develop solutions that may compete with, or be superior to, WATERSAVR. 

TPAs 

Our TPA products have direct competition with Lanxess AG (spun out of Bayer AG), a German manufacturer of TPAs, which uses a patented process different from ours. We have cross-licensed each other&#8217;s processes and either company can use either process for the term of the patents involved. We believe that Lanxess has approximately the same production capacity and product costs as we do. We believe that we can compete effectively with Lanxess by offering excellent customer service in oilfield sales, superior distributor support in the agricultural marketplace and flexibility due to our relative size. In addition, we intend to continue to seek market niches that are not the primary targets of Lanxess. 

Our TPA products face indirect competition from other chemicals in every market in which we are active. For purposes of oilfield scale prevention, phosphonates, phosphates and molibdonates provide the same effect. For crop enhancement, increased fertilizer levels or reduced concentrations can serve as a substitute for TPAs. In irrigation scale control, acid washes are our prime competitor. In detergent, poly-acrylic acid is most often used due to price advantage. Notwithstanding the above, we believe our competitive advantages include: 

&#9679; 

Biodegradability compared to competing oil field chemicals; 

&#9679; 

Cost-effectiveness for crop enhancement compared to increased fertilizer use; 

&#9679; 

Environmental considerations, ease of formulation and increased crop yield opportunities in irrigation scale markets; and 

&#9679; 

Biodegradability compared to poly-acrylic acid for detergents. 

Manufacturing 

Our HEATSAVR&#174; and ECOSAVR&#174; products and dispensers are made from chemicals, plastic and other materials and parts that are readily available from multiple suppliers. We have never experienced any shortage in the availability of raw materials and parts for these products and we do not have any long term supply contracts for any of these items. We manufacture these products in our plant in Taber, Alberta, Canada. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our WATERSAVR&#174; products are manufactured by a third party. We are not required to purchase any minimum quantity of this product. 

Our 56,780 sq. ft. facility in Peru, Illinois manufactures our TPA products. Raw materials for TPA production are sourced from various manufacturers throughout the world and we believe they are available in sufficient quantities for any increase in sales. Raw materials are, however, derived from crude oil and are subject to price fluctuations related to world oil prices. 

In November 2007, we purchased a building and 3.3 acres of land in Taber, Alberta, Canada. The price paid was CDN$1,325,000 and was financed by cash of $660,000 and an interest free mortgage that was paid in June 2008. The building has been renovated and can be used for various industrial purposes. It was operated as a fermentation facility for the production of aspartic acid, a key ingredient in TPAs. Aspartic acid made in Taber was then shipped to our plant in Illinois for finishing. In February 2014 we suspended production of aspartic acid at our Taber plant. The suspension was due to the fact that since construction of the plant began in 2008, economic conditions in Alberta and worldwide have changed significantly. In particular, plant operating costs have risen and the price of aspartic acid derived from oil is less than forecast. The future use of the facility has not been determined. 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

HEATSAVR&#174; and ECOSAVR &#174; 

Chemical products for use in swimming pools are covered by a variety of governmental regulations in all countries where we sell these products. These regulations cover packaging, labeling, and product safety. We believe our products are in compliance with these regulations. 

WATERSAVR&#174; 

Our WATERSAVR&#174; product is subject to regulation in most countries, particularly for agricultural and drinking water uses. We do not anticipate that governmental regulations will be an impediment to marketing WATERSAVR&#174; because the components in WATERSAVR&#174; have historically been used in agriculture for many years for other purposes. Nevertheless, we will need to obtain approval to sell WATERSAVR&#174; in the United States for agricultural and drinking water uses. We have received National Sanitation Foundation approval for the use of WATERSAVR&#174; in drinking water in the United States. 

TPAs 

In the oil field and agricultural markets we have received government approval for all TPAs currently sold. In the detergent market, there are currently no regulatory requirements for use of TPAs in detergent formulations. For personal care products such as shampoo and toothpaste, there are various regulatory bodies, including the National Sanitation Foundation and the United States Food and Drug Administration, which regulate TPA use. If we begin to market our TPA products for personal care use, we will need to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Proprietary Rights 

Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademarks, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We currently hold many U.S. and International patents which expire at various dates up to 2032. We also have applied to extend some of these patents to other countries where we operate. There can be no assurance that our foreign patent applications will be granted or that any issued patent will be upheld as valid or prevent the development of competitive products, which may be equivalent to or superior to our products. We have not received any claims alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, but there can be no assurance that we may not be subject to such claims in the future. 

Research and Development 

We spent $95,265 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $134,981 during year ended December 31, 2014 on research and development. This work relates primarily to the development of our water and energy conservation products, as well as new research in connection with our TPA products. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 we had 29 employees, including one officer, ten sales and customer support personnel, and eighteen manufacturing personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages to date.
