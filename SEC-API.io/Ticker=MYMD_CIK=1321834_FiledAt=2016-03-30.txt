Overview 

&#160; 

Akers Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;Akers,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) develops, manufactures, and supplies rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products designed to bring health-related information directly to the patient or clinician in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Akers believes it has advanced the science of diagnostics through the development of several innovative proprietary platform technologies that provide product development flexibility. 

&#160; 

All of Akers&#8217; rapid, single-use tests are performed in vitro (outside the body) and are designed to enhance patient well-being and reduce total outcome costs of healthcare. The Company&#8217;s current product offerings and pipeline products focus on delivering diagnostic assistance in a wide variety of healthcare fields/specialties, including cardiology/emergency medicine, metabolism/nutrition, diabetes, respiratory diseases and infectious diseases detection, as well as for on and off-the-job alcohol safety initiatives. 

&#160; 

Akers believes that low-cost, unit-use testing not only saves time and money, but allows for more frequent, near-patient testing which may save lives. We believe that Akers&#8217; FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic tests help facilitate targeted diagnoses and real-time treatment. We also believe that Akers&#8217; rapid diagnostic tests surpass most other current diagnostic products with their flexibility, speed, ease-of-use, readability, low cost and accuracy. In minutes, detection of disease states and medical conditions can be performed on single-patient specimens, without sacrificing accuracy. 

&#160; 

We believe the use of rapid tests, which can be performed at the point-of-care when and where the patient is being consulted, can result in immediate diagnostic decisions and subsequent treatment regimens and is an important development in the practice of medicine. Point-of-care testing addresses today&#8217;s challenges in the healthcare industry, such as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; cost pressures/efficiency of healthcare delivery; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; need for easy to use, accurate at-home tests for individuals to monitor their personal health and wellness; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; need for affordable mass screening tests for key infectious diseases, cardiac conditions, and metabolic markers; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; public health needs in developing countries lacking basic health infrastructure. 

&#160; 

Recently, the Company has developed tests for non-medical use within the health and wellness industry. These tests will monitor general markers of health and wellness as they relate to diet, nutrition and exercise programs.

Market Overview 

&#160; 

Worldwide, healthcare professionals use laboratory tests to support their clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions. According to a MarketsandMarkets report, In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Market (Applications, End-users &#38; Types) Trends &#38; Global Forecasts (Major &#38; Emerging Markets &#8212; G7, Japan &#38; BRIC) (2011 &#8211; 2016) , published in January 2012 (the &#8220;IVD Market Report&#8221;), the use of such tests continues to grow as a result of increased patient awareness, patient self-testing, and the aging baby boomer population across the globe. Other major drivers for the growth of the in vitro diagnostic (&#8220;IVD&#8221;) industry is a rise in the number of diseases like respiratory and hospital-acquired infections and a rise in the chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Both an increasing understanding of the molecular processes underlying many disease states and the opportunity for clinicians to quickly incorporate that targeted information into treatment decisions (e.g. companion testing). According to an article published on in vitro diagnostics by Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry (&#8220;MDDI&#8221;) online in March 2013, in the past, the in vitro diagnostics industry has focused on developing tests that require significant time, skill, and often costly, specialized equipment. Patient specimens often had to be collected remotely and processed in a central laboratory with test results sent to a physician at a later date. This general protocol is not particularly well-adapted to the practice of medicine in a cost-effective, timely manner. The pressures on public health budgets and falling profits among third party payors such as insurers, necessitates an alternative approach to disease management. Moreover, the implementation of &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; in the United States mandates that tens of millions of additional people receive cost-effective healthcare. This reality has changed the American healthcare landscape as evidenced by the steady growth of the retail health clinic and urgent care center markets. 

&#160; 

According to the IVD Market Report, outside of the United States, socialized medicine and/or a general atmosphere of cost-containment and healthcare efficiency are driving the need for diagnostic testing solutions that are fast, affordable, accurate, simple-to-perform and help enable early diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions or provide an assessment of a person&#8217;s health status. 

&#160; 

Akers designed its products based on single-use assay platforms with straightforward test procedures that can be completed in minutes. In the healthcare setting, the Company&#8217;s clinical laboratory products can be utilized near or at the point-of-care and do not require the use of expensive equipment or a highly trained or specialized staff. As a result, an individual&#8217;s current health status can immediately be incorporated into diagnostic and treatment decisions, improving the overall efficiency of the healthcare experience in the eyes of the patient, and ultimately the payor. In addition, in the developing world, the portability and ease-of-use of such point-of-care tests can serve to drastically improve the level of disease screening and subsequent patient care. We believe the benefits of our technology platforms are therefore well-suited to the diagnostic demands of third world countries that seek to deliver modern medical diagnosis in the midst of primitive infrastructures. In addition, some of our products have received FDA clearance for over-the-counter use and others that do not fall within the oversight of regulatory authorities have the added benefit of being self-tests that deliver personal health information on-demand. Akers believes that the products that emerge from its technology platforms address the needs of the evolving healthcare delivery system that is moving patient care closer to or in the home. 

&#160; 

In a June 6, 2013 article, &#8220; Global In Vitro Diagnostics Markets Outpace Pharma Industry Growth&#8221; by Frost &#38; Sullivan estimated the global IVD market was $45 billion, with forecasted revenue expected to reach $64 billion in 2017. While the U.S. and Western Europe are the largest IVD markets, the Asian-Pacific region and Eastern Europe are projected to be the fastest growing by Frost &#38; Sullivan. The Company&#8217;s main presence is in the United States, but recently executed joint venture, distribution and licensing agreements have initiated Akers&#8217; strategic move to the China and European Union marketplaces. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; strategy is to target carefully chosen, high margin market segments within the diagnostics industry where existing tests do not effectively fulfill clinical requirements, or an emerging, unfulfilled need has been identified. The Company seeks to develop tests for applications based on their ability to compliment a particular treatment, lifestyle or testing regimen that requires a time and cost-efficient diagnostic alternative or solution. Akers utilizes its existing platform technologies to internally develop its new products as the Company&#8217;s proprietary methods. 

&#160; 

Akers has established and will continue to pursue distribution relationships with high volume, medical and health &#38; wellness product marketers to maximize its revenue potential, and to be a worldwide competitor in specialized markets within the diagnostics industry. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Akers has developed and continues to develop key strategic relationships with established companies with well-trained technical sales forces and strong distribution networks in the following key market segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Clinical Laboratories; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Physicians&#8217; Office and Urgent Care Clinics; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Retail; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Nutraceutical Suppliers; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Military/Government. &#160;

The Company plans to target other attractive markets such as aid organizations with purchasing power for rapid infectious disease tests and other biotechnology companies or pharmaceutical manufacturers that may require companion tests to promote patient compliance with a medication regimen or facilitate initial screenings to qualify patients for a particular therapy. 

&#160; 

Technology Overview 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; proprietary platform technologies merge scientific innovation with user-friendly formats to deliver cost-effective and time-efficient testing and sample preparation solutions where and when they are needed. 

&#160; 

Testing Platform Technologies 

&#160; 

MPC Biosensor Technology 

&#160; 

MicroParticle Catalyzed Biosensor (&#8220;MPC Biosensor&#8221;) Technology permits the rapid identification of medical conditions through biomarkers in exhaled breath. These products contain microparticles that change color when a subject has a positive test result. The microparticles are coated with recently discovered agents that both decrease the time to result and provide a more defined color change when appropriate. MPC Biosensor-based products are packaged in small, disposable cartridges through which test subjects can easily blow for several seconds. In the United States, the MPC Biosensor Technology is protected by three United States patents pending, covering all MPC Biosensor products such as BreathScan and the Breath PulmoHealth &#8220;Check&#8221; suite of products. Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; has one US and one international patent granted. In addition, Akers also holds three US, three Australian and three European Community Design patents for Color Comparison Card technology that users can utilize to interpret detector results. 

&#160; 

Particle ImmunoFiltration Assay (PIFA&#174;) Technology 

&#160; 

PIFA&#174; technology is an accurate, rapid, immunoassay ( a procedure for detecting or measuring specific proteins or other substances through their properties as antigens or antibodies ) method based on the selective filtration of dyed microparticles coated with antigen or antibody. The microparticles are combined with a test sample (whole blood, serum, urine or saliva) within a self-contained device. If a patient tests positive for the antibody or antigen, a binding event will occur and the dyed microparticles will be trapped by a filter within the device. As a result, the test window will be void of any color. Conversely, if the patient tests negative, the dyed microparticles will flow freely into the test window. Akers&#8217; PIFA&#174; Technology is currently protected by United States patent (5,827,749) covering all PIFA tests such as Heparin, Malaria and Chlamydia. Specific to the PIFA Heparin tests, the Company has one international Patent (JP 4,931,821) granted in force, and three patent applications pending (one US and two international). 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

SMC Technology 

&#160; 

Synthetic Macrocycle Complex (&#8220;SMC&#8221;) Technology is a colorimetric testing methodology that pairs a proprietary reagent ( a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions) with a hand-held, photometric reader that determines the quantitative level of a therapeutic drug in a patient&#8217;s blood sample. The technology also permits the use of whole blood samples collected from a simple finger stick, making products that use this technology extremely flexible within the healthcare delivery system. 

&#160; 

Rapid Enzymatic Assay 

&#160; 

Rapid Enzymatic Assay (&#8220;REA&#8221;) technology enables the rapid detection of metabolites in blood and urine in assay formats that are easy-to-use and deliver quantitative or semi-quantitative results. Products that employ REA technology are primarily intended for pharmaceutical, nutritional and over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) markets. Akers has three United States patents (8,808,639; 8,003,061; 8,425,859) for this technology covering our Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221; test, along with one US patent application pending. 

&#160; 

minDNA TM Technology 

&#160; 

minDNA TM technology facilitates the analysis of DNA, in one minute, by a hand-held photometric reader. A mixture consisting of a patient&#8217;s whole blood specimen and a disposable reagent is exposed to the minDNAnalyzer, a digital hand-held reflectance photometer. These assays can be utilized at the point of care setting by non-clinical laboratory personnel using finger stick blood samples, or in the laboratory using EDTA whole blood specimens obtained through venous blood draws. This technology can be applied to the development of rapid white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count assays that can monitor side effects of certain psychiatric and oncology drugs. 

&#160; 

Sample Preparation Technology 

&#160; 

Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; Rapid Blood Cell Separation (&#8220;Separator&#8221;) Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT&#174;, further accelerates the rate at which a test result is obtained as the often-required sample preparation step is abbreviated drastically. Conventional methods of blood cell separation are labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically involving blood collection and laboratory personnel, as well as electrically-powered centrifuges and other specialized equipment. The disposable Separator device requires only a small-volume blood sample obtained from a time and cost-efficient finger stick procedure or through a venous blood draw. Akers has obtained the appropriate US FDA regulatory clearances for seraSTAT&#174; as a stand-alone device and the technology is currently integrated into PIFA PLUSS PF4 devices, and will be utilized in the infectious disease products currently under development. The seraSTAT&#174; Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology is currently protected by two United States patents (7,896,167; 8,097,171) and one international patent (JP 4,885,134), with two additional international patent applications pending. 

&#160; 

Product Portfolio 

&#160; 

Akers is positioned as a provider of rapid diagnostic solutions that encompass the totality of the point-of-care testing process, from sample preparation to immediate test result. In addition, we believe we are a pioneer in disposable breath condensate technology, a testing format that has significant potential given the variety of wellness- and disease-predicting biomarkers present in an exhaled breath sample. 

&#160; 

At present, Akers&#8217; commercialized and emerging product portfolio incorporates four of the Company&#8217;s six proprietary platform testing technologies: PIFA&#174;, MPC Biosensor, REA and Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology. Directly below, is a discussion of the products within our current and emerging portfolio that will be segmented by platform. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Akers designed its products based on single-use assay platforms with straightforward test procedures that can be completed in minutes. In the U.S. some of the Company&#8217;s clinical laboratory products and those with medical intended uses generally require &#8220;prescription use&#8221; Federal Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) 510(k) clearance prior to product marketing given that they will be ordered or used by medical practitioners in the course of his or her professional practice. Despite this categorization, Akers&#8217; professional use products are still designed for ease of use, can be utilized near or at the point-of-care, and do not require the use of expensive equipment or a highly trained or specialized staff. As a result, an individual&#8217;s current health status can rapidly be incorporated into diagnostic and treatment decisions, improving the overall efficiency of the healthcare experience in the eyes of the patient, and ultimately the payer. In addition, in the developing world, the portability and ease-of-use of such point-of-care tests can serve to drastically improve the level of disease screening and subsequent patient care. We believe the benefits of our technology platforms are therefore well-suited to the diagnostic demands of countries in the developing world that seek to deliver modern medical diagnosis in the midst of primitive infrastructures. In addition, some of our products have received FDA 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) use. Other self-tests deliver personal health information of a non-medical nature, on-demand, and are not FDA regulated; these products are still manufactured in compliance with its ISO 13485 quality management system (&#8220;QMS-Compliant&#8221;). Akers believes that all its technology platforms and products address the needs of the evolving healthcare delivery system that is moving patient care closer to or in the home. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth our marketed and current pipeline products, identifies the appropriate &#8220;prescription use&#8221; or &#8220;OTC&#8221; designation and whether the required clearance has been obtained or is still needed prior to product marketing.

&#160; 

MPC Biosensor Technology 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s MPC Biosensor breath condensate testing platform forms the basis of a number of Akers&#8217; marketed and pipeline products. 

&#160; 

Breath Alcohol Franchise 

&#160; 

BreathScan&#174; originated the disposable breath alcohol detector category and was the first single-use breathalyzer to obtain the FDA 510(k) clearance in 2006 for Over-the-Counter use required to facilitate sales to US consumers; CE certification is not required to market the product in the EU given that BreathScan&#174; results are not used to diagnose any medical conditions. However, the Company has received certification under the French Standard, NF X 20-702 which defines the specifications that chemical breath alcohol detectors must meet in order to be sold to consumers in France. In addition, the Company&#8217;s breath alcohol detector technology was granted an Australian Standard certification trademark, which cleared the commercial pathway for product sales in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s disposable breath alcohol detectors are available in .02%, .04%, .05% and .08% blood alcohol concentrations (&#8220;BACs&#8221;) and provide users with a test result in two minutes. If the crystals in the interior of the device change from yellow to aqua, the user has tested positive for the specific alcohol level. Should the crystals remain yellow, the result is negative. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s proprietary breath alcohol detection technology is paired with the quantitative precision of an electronic analyzer in the BreathScan&#174; PRO alcohol detection system. As with all BreathScan&#174; products, the test subject exhales into a specially calibrated, BreathScan&#174; PRO detector. The testing coordinator then inserts the used detector into the BreathScan&#174; PRO Digital Analyzer. After two minutes, the Analyzer&#8217;s sophisticated optics calculate the subject&#8217;s BAC; the detectable range spans from 0.00% to 1.50% BAC. Unlike other electronic breathalyzers, BreathScan&#174; PRO never requires recalibration so it is in &#8220;ready&#8221; mode at all times. In 2011, the Company received FDA over-the-counter clearance for the system, providing a commercialization path in the U.S. for use by trained professionals, including those in civil and military law enforcement, and the general public; in addition, the CE-Mark was affixed to the alcohol detection system for professional use. Unlike the aforementioned BreathScan&#174; disposable detectors, BreathScan&#174; PRO is required to have a CE-Mark as the system includes an electronic component, namely the digital analyzer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Since the appropriate regulatory clearances have been obtained in the United States and other major markets requiring specific certifications for specific devices (i.e. France and Australia for the Company&#8217;s single-use detectors for these products), the Company does not anticipate needing to fund additional clinical trials to facilitate or initiate product marketing in other international regions thus far. 

&#160; 

Other Emerging MPC Platform Products 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s MPC Biosensor technology is being applied to the development of products that serve the nutraceutical and weight loss marketplaces. As a category, these disposable screening tests are exempt from FDA 510(k) premarket clearances. Biomarkers related to various metabolic processes can be measured in breath condensate. As a result, Akers has used its proprietary, easy-to-use platform to design disposable breath tubes that measure ketone (acid) production associated with fat-burning (METRON&#174; and KetoChek) and oxidative stress levels that relate to cellular damage and the development of many preventable diseases (OxiChek). The Company believes that personalized health and wellness - and eventually personalized medicine &#8211; will become an increasingly significant market. The Company is positioning its tests for weight loss and oxidative stress for this market by designing a more consumer-focused reagent device, and linking this device to an application for smartphones and tablets that can not only produce a result, but also track progress over time. Initial marketing activities have commenced for these products and the Company is preparing for commercialization. The Company is currently assessing distribution opportunities with companies specializing in weight loss and/or mass distribution through health-related multilevel marketing organizations. Since devices with claims related to weight loss or nutrition are exempt from FDA oversight, a clinical program to support 510(k) submission is not required for any of these products. Given the non-medical intended use, the Company does not believe products will be required to hold a CE-mark prior to marketing in the EU. 

&#160; 

Akers is continuing its clinical development of the Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; disposable breath tube for the diagnosis of ketoacidosis in diabetics. Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; is being designed to provide real-time information that allows diabetics to determine if they have a more severe level of ketone (acid) build up in their body that can cause a life-threatening medical emergency called ketoacidosis. The estimated 28.5 million Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetics worldwide are at particular risk for ketoacidosis and require routine monitoring of their ketone levels. To date, the medical industry relies on blood and urine-based ketone testing methods, which are invasive and/or inconvenient. Since breath and blood ketone levels are closely correlated, the Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; is designed to offer healthcare professionals and their patients a convenient, accurate method, which can be completed anytime, anywhere, to quickly determine if an individual&#8217;s ketone level is approaching a dangerous threshold requiring medical attention. Since this product requires FDA 510(k) clearance, the Company continues to develop its technical file and complete required clinical studies to complete the regulatory submission. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company is also devoting resources to the research and development of the Breath PulmoHealth &#8220;Check&#8221; suite of assays. These disposable detectors are being designed to signal the detection of various biomarkers related to pulmonary health, namely asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (&#8220;COPD&#8221;) and lung cancer, through convenient, rapid analysis of an individual&#8217;s breath sample. Akers has chosen to target this trio of conditions due to their significant impact on global health: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; over 300 million people worldwide are living with asthma and up to 18% of a country&#8217;s population are undiagnosed asthmatics; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 210 million individuals are being treated for COPD but each of the 1 billion smokers worldwide are at risk for the disease; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; more than 1.6 million people worldwide receive the diagnosis of lung cancer annually with many more victims expected as 80% of all lung cancers can be attributed to smoking. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Akers believes these statistics suggest that pulmonary conditions are under-diagnosed and under-treated and will continue to pose a chronic strain on worldwide public health. Currently, diagnostic methods used for the detection of lung-related diseases and illnesses are often costly as specialized medical personnel must facilitate analysis and testing, and radiologic exams or invasive surgical procedures may be required. While Akers does not presume Breath PulmoHealth &#8220;Check&#8221; products to be replacements for such tests in all markets, it does however have ambitions for the devices to become effective, highly cost-efficient, primary screening tools. Their ease-of-use, portability and non-invasive nature provide healthcare professionals and public health officials with a testing platform that can be deployed in high volume, and even in regions of the developing world. At present, the Company&#8217;s primary development efforts are focused on configuring the clinical dossier for the asthma product. 

&#160; 

The Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; and the Breath PulmoHealth &#8220;Check&#8221; suite of products will require the development of individual clinical trial programs to facilitate eventual FDA 510(k) submissions. The Company has self-certified Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; as being in compliance with CE requirements in the EU, and intends to pursue the same designation for each product in the Breath PulmoHealth &#8220;Check&#8221; trio once the appropriate technical file is assembled. 

&#160; 

MPC Biosensor technology is currently protected by one United States patents (8,871,521).

The core products marketed under the PIFA&#174; platform are the PIFA&#174; Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay, PIFA PLUSS&#174; PF4, and a variety of rapid Infectious Disease screening tests which target markets in the developing world. 

&#160; 

PIFA&#174; Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay and PIFA PLUSS&#174; PF4 remain the only FDA-cleared rapid manual assays that quickly determine if a patient being treated with the blood thinner Heparin may be developing a drug allergy. This clinical syndrome, referred to as Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (&#8220;HIT&#8221;), reverses the Heparin&#8217;s intended therapeutic effect and transforms it into a clotting agent. According to &#8220; Current Concepts Review: Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia&#8221; , published by Foot and Ankle International in 2008 (the &#8220;HIT Report&#8221;), patients with HIT are at risk of developing limb- and life-threatening complications, so the timely test result provided by Akers&#8217; Heparin/PF4 devices is paramount to effective clinical decision making. In the U.S. alone, approximately 12 million patients are exposed to Heparin annually and 1% to 5% of those patients receive a HIT diagnosis. The largest at-risk populations are patients undergoing major cardiac or orthopedic surgical procedures. It is estimated that up to 50% of cardiac surgery patients develop HIT-antibodies. Given the size of the aging baby boomer market segment and the prevalence of cardiac disease, surgeries within this category is expected to increase, as would the potential demand for the Company&#8217;s convenient, rapid tests. 

&#160; 

The PIFA&#174; Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay improves the standard of care in HIT-testing with its result delivered in less than five minutes after the patient sample has been prepared. Traditional methods required the use of expensive equipment, specialized laboratory personnel and approximately four hours of technician time to complete the 20+ assay test procedure in-house, Clinicians were subjected to a 24-to-72 hour turnaround time if the HIT-antibody determination was outsourced to a reference laboratory. Especially in the latter scenario, the patient information obtained is retrospective in nature as the HIT-antibody result cannot be factored into time-sensitive diagnostic and treatment decisions. The Company has also introduced PIFA PLUSS PF4 to U.S. hospitals to further improve the rate at which healthcare professionals can obtain a HIT-antibody result. 

&#160; 

This PIFA&#174; line extension merges the ease-of-use of the PIFA testing platform with Akers&#8217; recently patented Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT&#174;. The marriage of these two technologies condenses the sample preparation and analysis procedures as the precise micro-volume of a seraSTAT&#174; -prepared patient specimen is delivered directly into the PIFA&#174; cassette for immediate testing. This eliminates an additional one-hour of sample processing time and the need for healthcare personnel to have access to a centrifuge to separate the liquid fraction of blood from the cellular fraction. As a result, HIT-testing can be initiated and completed at or near the point-of-care, especially in emergency and critical care departments where time-efficient diagnostic results can drastically improve patient outcomes.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Since the appropriate regulatory clearances have been obtained in the United States for these products, the Company does not anticipate needing to fund additional clinical trials to facilitate product marketing domestically. In addition, the current technical file that has been assembled for seraSTAT&#174; and PIFA PLUSS PF4&#174; will also be used to support Akers&#8217; CE-marking self-certification process to initiate product sales in the EU; the PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay is already CE-marked. The Company&#8217;s strategy in foreign jurisdictions that may require additional clinical trials to support regulatory clearance, as is the case in China, is to partner with a distributor that will fund the required clinical program in exchange for some degree of marketing exclusivity. 

&#160; 

Other PIFA&#174; Platform Assays in development 

&#160; 

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, &#8220; Emerging Infectious Diseases: a 10-Year Perspective from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, volume 11, Number 4 &#8212; April 2005&#8221;, infectious diseases account for more than 15 million deaths annually. That equates to one in every two deaths in developing countries. Given that more than 80% of the world&#8217;s population lives in the 100-plus developing countries, the need for infectious disease screening tests and effective treatment options has global implications. The expansive geographies combined with underdeveloped, underfunded healthcare infrastructures make rapid, single-use, portable devices that do not require special instrumentation, key to any infectious disease-containment solution. 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; PIFA&#174; technology provides a testing format that meets the aforementioned criteria. The Company can quickly apply the PIFA PLUSS&#174; methodology to its infectious disease testing products to further consolidate the test result turn-around time and eliminate the need for any specialized sample preparation personnel or equipment which are usually not at the disposal of healthcare professionals in remote locations. To date, the Company&#8217;s custom reagent work has focused on a variety of infectious diseases, markers of cardiovascular disease, and blood typing tests including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Chlamydia &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Malaria &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Dengue Fever &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Troponin I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ABOD Battlefield Blood Transfusion Card 

&#160; 

REA Technology 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221; test is initiated with an easy-to-obtain finger stick blood sample, and provides users with an estimate of both their total and high density lipoprotein (&#8220;HDL&#8221;) cholesterol levels, and by a simple calculation, approximates their low density lipoprotein (&#8220;LDL&#8221;) level. We believe that there is global demand for this category of disposable tests given healthcare trends that identify cardiovascular disease, and related risk factors like high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure. These complications are particularly on the rise in developing nations that have gained access to the dietary habits of the west. In fact, studies reported by Middle East Health Magazine recently conducted in various medical centers throughout Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (&#8220;UAE&#8221;) categorized the cardiovascular health risk as being on the edge of a potentially serious epidemic. In addition, the research revealed that half the subjects were undiagnosed prior to participating in the study that may be indicative of insufficient healthcare resources. This regional case study has global application as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and access to healthcare remains a challenge to much of the aggregate population. This drives home the need for rapid, straightforward screening tests that are easily accessible to individuals for routine monitoring. 

&#160; 

Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221; has the appropriate U.S. FDA market clearances and is also CE-marked for sale in the European Union for professional use. At present, the Company&#8217;s Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221; business strategy is to focus on distribution activities in countries within the developing world. Once Akers completes an assessment of opportunities within the region, it intends to determine if additional clinical data outside of the robust technical file assembled to support FDA-clearance and CE-certification will be required for product marketing. 

&#160; 

The REA Technology is currently protected by three United States patents (8,808,639; 8,003,061; 8,425,859).

Sample Preparation Technology 

&#160; 

Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology 

&#160; 

In addition to the Company&#8217;s testing platforms, Akers&#8217; recently patented Rapid Blood Cell Separation (&#8220;Separator&#8221;) Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT&#174;, further accelerates the rate at which a test result is obtained as the often-required sample preparation step is abbreviated drastically. Conventional methods of blood cell separation are labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically involving blood collection and laboratory personnel, as well as electrically-powered centrifuges and other specialized equipment. The Separator device requires only a small-volume blood sample obtained from a time- and cost-efficient finger stick procedure. 

&#160; 

The required micro-volume specimen of serum or plasma is immediately extracted and introduced into a rapid assay device for real-time analysis. The savings afforded by the Separator device can be measured in time and cost given its quick turn-around-time and straightforward, easy-to-master procedure. 

&#160; 

Since the appropriate regulatory clearances have been obtained in the United States for seraSTAT&#174; as a stand-alone device, the Company does not anticipate needing to fund additional clinical trials to expand product marketing domestically. Currently, seraSTAT&#174; is integrated into PIFA PLUSS PF4 devices, and will be utilized in the infectious disease products currently under development. Akers may consider partnerships with other medical device companies, functioning as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;), as the benefits of the seraSTAT&#174; Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology can be integrated into other assay platforms. Also, the current technical file that has been assembled for seraSTAT&#174; will be used to support Akers&#8217; CE-marking self-certification process to initiate product sales in the EU. The Company&#8217;s strategy in foreign jurisdictions that may require additional clinical trials to support regulatory clearance is to partner with a distributor that will fund the required clinical program in exchange for some degree of marketing exclusivity. 

&#160; 

The seraSTAT&#174; Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technologies currently protected by two United States patents (7,896,167; 8,097,171) and one international patent (JP 4,885,134). 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competitors of Akers include other companies developing and marketing rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices and companies with dedicated laboratory instruments and/or automated test systems. We face intense competition from companies with dominant market positions within the in vitro diagnostic testing market such as Abbott, ACON Laboratories, Inc., Alere, Diagnostica Stago, SA., Immucor, Inc., OraSure Technologies, Inc., and Quidel Corporation. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the primary criteria for determining competitiveness within the rapid point-of-care sector are cost, ease-of-use, speed, readability, accuracy and flexibility. The time required by Akers to develop a working prototype test ready for clinical trials typically ranges from eight to twelve weeks from inception. We believe that competitors&#8217; laboratory tests normally require at least a year to develop to a similar point. 

&#160; 

However, our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be better able to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; respond to new technologies or technical standards; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; devote resources to the development, production, promotion, support and sale of products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; acquire other companies to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines; &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; react to changing customer requirements and expectations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; manufacture, market and sell products; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; deliver a broad range of competitive products at lower prices. &#160; 

Our principal competitors are able to leverage their broader product portfolios and dominant market positions in some segments by, for example, bundling their products into specially priced packages that create strong financial incentives for their customers to purchase their products. These practices may negate savings customers would gain from buying select products from Akers and may deter such customers from buying Akers&#8217; products. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. 

&#160; 

How we Generate Revenue 

&#160; 

The majority of our revenue comes from selling rapid, screening and testing products, largely through our distribution networks. Some of our assays are used in the clinical laboratory to ultimately help healthcare professionals to diagnose a medical condition or complication that may require treatment. Other products can be sold over-the-counter, to the general public, to help assess an individual&#8217;s status as it relates to his/her blood alcohol or cholesterol level, to help monitor his/her progress on a specific wellness regimen, and/or to screen for a biomarker that may be indicative of an individual&#8217;s general level of health. Some of our revenue is associated with licensing payments that may relate to exclusive access to specific markets. 

&#160; 

Our Current Target Markets 

&#160; 

Regarding the Company&#8217;s test for the heparin drug allergy, the testing market largely resides within the clinical hospital laboratories of medical facilities. In the U.S., the Company accesses decision makers within these institutions through profiling by its highly trained technical sales team and collaborative prospecting with distributor sales representatives. Internationally, Akers provides comprehensive training to its distributor partners which will enable them to implement the same selling and technical training strategies. 

&#160; 

The markets for alcohol breathalyzers are reached through a network of large and small distributors. These markets include industrial safety, education, law enforcement, social responsibility and retail. 

&#160; 

The health and wellness markets include nutraceutical companies, fitness centers and diet and weight loss centers. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

&#160; 

We are a vertically integrated manufacturer, producing substantially all of our devices in-house. The vast majority of our products start out as high quality, medical grade polymers and exit our facilities as fully manufactured and packaged medical devices. As a result, we have a short supply line between our raw materials and finished goods which gives us greater control over our product quality. The downside of our in-house manufacturing is the requirements for facilities, power, and equipment. This approach also requires mid-to-long-term planning and the ability to predict future needs. Many of our processes are unique to us, but the Company&#8217;s flexible manufacturing capabilities and unused current capacity generally translate into relatively short production timelines. As demand for our products increase, additional capacities may be required to advance our evolving needs. 

&#160; 

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and select items, such as packaging, from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of proprietary know-how, quality assurance, sole source availability, or due to regulatory qualification requirements. US medical device manufacturers must establish and follow quality systems to help ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. The quality systems for FDA-regulated products are known as current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8217;s&#8221;). cGMP requirements for devices in part 820 (21 CFR part 820) were first authorized by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On February 4, 2015, the Company&#8217;s quality management system was certified as compliant with the International Standards Organization&#8217;s (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 13485:2003 requirements for the design, manufacture and distribution of medical devices including in vitro diagnostic products. 

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

We distribute our products through direct and indirect channels of distribution. We have well-developed indirect distribution channels in the U.S. with, among others, Cardinal Health 200, Inc. (&#8220;Cardinal Health&#8221;), Fisher Healthcare, a Division of Fisher Scientific Company L.L.C. (&#8220;Fisher Healthcare&#8221;), Medline Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Medline&#8221;), and Typenex Medical L.L.C. (&#8220;Typenex&#8221;) for the Company&#8217;s PIFA Heparin/PF4 assays. The relationships with Cardinal Health and Fisher Healthcare provide us with access to the majority of U.S. hospitals. 

&#160; 

With respect to the Company&#8217;s breath alcohol franchise, historically Akers focused its commercial attention within the on-the-job safety/human resources sector. Access was and currently is largely achieved through designated BreathScan&#174; distributors and limited arrangements in which the Company serves in an OEM capacity. 

&#160; 

Our dedicated technical sales force works in tandem with distributor sales representatives to uncover opportunities in the clinical laboratory marketplace. The Company facilitates direct sales for hospitals that prefer to purchase direct from the manufacturer. 

&#160; 

Since 2012, the Company has also had a distribution relationship with Novotek Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Novotek&#8221;), a Beijing-based pharmaceutical and in vitro diagnostic business development corporation. The multi-year distribution agreement assigns exclusive sales and marketing rights to Novotek to make Akers&#8217; Particle ImmunoFiltration Assay (&#8220;PIFA&#8221;) products available in Mainland China and that market clearance has now been obtained. 

&#160; 

In select European countries and Australia we have distribution relationships with specialized sales and marketing organizations for some of our products. We do not have a strong presence in many emerging markets, but are seeking to enter into agreements to enable us to enter other international markets in the current fiscal year. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 sales to Cardinal Health and Fisher Healthcare accounted for a significant part of the Company&#8217;s product revenue. This concentration makes the Company vulnerable to a near-term severe impact should the relationships be terminated. 

&#160; 

Joint Venture 

&#160; 

On October 24, 2014, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the &#8220;Joint Venture Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Company, Hainan Savy Investment Management Ltd. (&#8220;Hainan&#8221;) and Mr. Thomas Knox, the Company&#8217;s Non-Executive Co-Chairman, to research, develop, produce and sell certain Akers rapid diagnostic screening and testing products in China (the &#8220;Joint Venture&#8221;). The Joint Venture is located in Haikou, the capital city of Hainan, China, and is incorporated as Hainan Savy Akers Biosciences, Ltd (&#8220;HSAB&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary platform technologies and our brands. We also rely on confidentiality procedures and agreements with key employees and distribution/business partners where appropriate, and contractual provisions to achieve the same. We do not pursue patent protection where the possibility for meaningful enforcement is limited. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 

&#160; 

Akers&#8217; Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221;, PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay, BreathScan PRO alcohol detection system, and the Breath Ketone &#8220;Check&#8221; are CE-marked for sale in the EU for professional use. The CE-mark must be affixed to a product that is intended, by the manufacturer, to be used for a medical purpose and will be sold into EU member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. For Akers&#8217; current and proposed &#8220;medical-purpose&#8221; products, the CE-marking process is facilitated by self-certification, as a manufacturer must carry out a conformity assessment, perform any appropriate electromagnetic testing, create a technical file with supporting documentation, and sign an EC declaration of conformity. The documentation is verified by the Company&#8217;s authorized representative in the EU and must be made available to authorities upon request. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must receive 510(k) clearance. It has been the Company&#8217;s experience thus far, that the FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but can last significantly longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market. We have obtained the required FDA clearance for all of our current products that require such clearance. 

&#160; 

The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or Premarket approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;). PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA approval process is based on statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification (&#8220;PMN&#8221;) requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The PMN must demonstrate that the proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device, which is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application. 

&#160; 

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA&#8217;s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) PMN process described below. A small number of our products are Class I devices. 

&#160; 

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Class II devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) PMN procedure. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, or MDUFMA, as of October 2002 unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) PMN submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. A majority of our products, encompassing all of our significant product lines, are Class II devices. 

&#160; 

Class III devices are those devices which have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below. Premarket approval applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees under MDUFMA than are 510(k) PMNs. None of our products are Class III devices. 

&#160; 

A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. 

&#160; 

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation 

&#160; 

A host of regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Reporting Regulations (&#8220;MDR&#8221;) regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA&#8217;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses. Class II devices also can have special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidelines that do not apply to class I devices. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new cGMP requirements could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Health Care Fraud and Abuse 

&#160; 

In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the Federal Health Care Programs&#8217; Anti-Kickback Law (42 U.S.C. &#167;1320a-7b(b)) prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). Recognizing that the federal anti-kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued regulations, known as the safe harbors, which identify permissible practices. If all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor are met, an arrangement will not be prosecuted under this law. Safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving GPOs. The failure of an arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. However, conduct that does not fully satisfy each requirement of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG or the Department of Justice. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal anti-kickback law, many states have their own kickback laws. Often, these state laws closely follow the language of the federal law. Some state anti-kickback laws apply regardless of whether a federal health care program payment is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and relationship with health care providers or laboratory professionals by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products.

Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. &#167;3729 et seq.) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program (including Medicaid and Medicare). Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#8217;s products from reimbursement under government programs, and imprisonment. 

&#160; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements related to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willingly executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 

&#160; 

Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. Companies are now required to obtain a CE Mark, which shows conformance with the requirements of applicable European Conformity directives, prior to sale of some medical devices within the European Union. Some of our current products that require CE Markings have them and it is anticipated that additional and future products may require them as well. As of the date of this filing, the Company has received CE marks for eight for of its commercialized products/product components: PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay; Heparin/PF4 Serum Panels; Tri-Cholesterol &#8220;Check&#8221; and BreathScan PRO Detectors, Analyzer Field Kit, Starter Kit and Blow Bags.

Third-Party Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Health care providers, including hospitals, that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private payors, such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result, demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. 

&#160; 

CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, along with its contractors establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. In addition, private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. 

&#160; 

In general, Medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. Even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available, Medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage. For some of our products, our success in non-U.S. markets may depend upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third-party payors through which health care providers are paid in those markets. Health care payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country, and include single-payor, government managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government-managed systems exist, side-by-side. For some of our products, our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets may be dependent on the availability of reimbursement for our products under health care payment systems in such markets. There can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products, will be obtained or that such reimbursement will be adequate. 

&#160; 

Other U.S. Regulation 

&#160; 

We must also comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently employ 36 full-time equivalent employees, contractors or consultants, which include 9 in research and development, 6 in general and administrative, 10 in sales and marketing and 11 in direct and indirect manufacturing. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
