We are able to provide turnkey packaging and test services including semiconductor wafer bump, wafer probe, wafer backgrind, package design, packaging, test and drop shipment services. Our customers use us for one or more of these services. 

We provide our services to integrated device manufacturers (&#8220;IDMs&#8221;), &#8220;fabless&#8221; semiconductor companies and contract foundries. IDMs generally design, manufacture, package and test semiconductors in their own facilities. However, the availability of technologically advanced outsourced manufacturing services has encouraged IDMs to outsource a portion of their manufacturing. Fabless semiconductor companies do not have factories and focus exclusively on the semiconductor design process and outsource virtually every step of the manufacturing process. Fabless semiconductor companies utilize contract foundries to manufacture their semiconductors in wafer form, and companies such as Amkor for their packaging and test needs. Some companies will engage a contract foundry to manage the complete semiconductor manufacturing process, and in turn, the contract foundry will outsource some of its packaging and test needs. 

Our IDM customers include: Infineon Technologies AG; Intel Corporation; Micron Technology, Inc.; Renesas Electronics Corporation; STMicroelectronics N.V.; Texas Instruments Incorporated and Toshiba Corporation. Our fabless customers include: Avago Technologies; Broadcom Corporation and Qualcomm Incorporated. Our contract foundry customers include: GlobalFoundries Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited. &#32; 

J-Devices Corporation 

On December 30, 2015 , we increased our ownership in J-Devices Corporation from 65.7% to 100% through the exercise of existing options. As a result, our accounting for J-Devices changed from the equity method to the consolidation method effective at the time of acquisition. 

J-Devices is the largest provider of outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services in Japan with net sales of $0.8 billion in 2015. J-Devices' business covers a broad range of packaging and test services focused on the automotive, industrial and consumer end markets. 

&#32;3 

J-Devices was formed in 2009 as a result of a joint venture between Amkor, Toshiba and J-Devices' predecessor, Nakaya Microdevices Corporation ("NMD"). As part of this transaction, J-Devices acquired certain assets and business, including technology development, of Toshiba's semiconductor packaging business. Since that time, J-Devices has experienced considerable growth through various acquisitions, including the purchase of three packaging and test facilities from Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited in 2012, the purchase of three additional packaging and test facilities from Renesas Electronics Corporation in 2013 and the purchase of our previously wholly-owned subsidiary engaged in semiconductor packaging and test operations in Japan in 2014.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 

Semiconductor devices are the essential building blocks used in most electronic products. As electronic and semiconductor devices have evolved, several important trends have emerged that have fueled the growth of the overall semiconductor industry, as well as the market for outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services. These trends include: 

&#8226; 

An increasing demand for mobile and home internet-connected devices, including the world-wide adoption of mobile &#8220;smart&#8221; phones and tablets that can access the internet and provide multimedia capabilities. 

&#8226; 

An increase in mobility and connectivity capabilities and growing digital content driving demand for new broadband wired and wireless networking equipment. 

&#8226; 

The proliferation of semiconductor devices into well-established end products such as automotive systems due to increased use of electronics for safety, navigation, fuel efficiency, emission reduction and entertainment systems. 

&#8226; 

An overall increase in the semiconductor content within electronic products to provide greater functionality and higher levels of performance. 

&#8226; 

The growth of advanced System-in-Package ("SiP") modules where multiple semiconductor components with different functionalities are combined into a single integrated circuit ("IC") package. The increasing demand for miniaturization and higher functionality at competitive cost is driving the adoption of advanced SiP in new products. 

Our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as world-wide gross domestic product and consumer spending. Historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between world-wide gross domestic product levels, consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles. 

Outsourcing Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing 

Semiconductor companies outsource their packaging and test needs to service providers such as Amkor for the following reasons: 

&#32;4 

Packaging and test service providers have developed expertise in advanced technologies. 

Semiconductor packaging and test technologies continue to become more sophisticated, complex and customized due to increasing demands for miniaturization, greater functionality, lower power consumption and improved thermal and electrical performance. This trend has led many semiconductor companies and OEMs to view packaging and test as enabling technologies requiring sophisticated expertise and technological innovation. Many of these companies are also relying on packaging and test &#32; service providers as key sources for new package designs and advanced interconnect technologies, thereby enabling them to reduce their internal research and development costs. 

Packaging and test service providers offer a cost effective solution in a highly cyclical, capital intensive industry. 

The semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as changes in worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending. Semiconductor packaging and test are complex processes requiring substantial investment in specialized equipment, factories and human resources. As a result of this cyclicality and the large investments required, manufacturing facilities must operate at consistently high levels of utilization to be cost effective. Shorter product life cycles, coupled with the need to update or replace packaging and test equipment to accommodate new package types, make it more difficult for integrated semiconductor companies to maintain cost effective utilization of their packaging and test assets throughout semiconductor industry cycles. Packaging and test service providers, on the other hand, can typically use their assets to support a broad range of customers, potentially generating more efficient use of their production assets and a more cost effective solution. 

Packaging and test service providers can facilitate a more efficient supply chain and help shorten time-to-market for new products. 

We believe that semiconductor companies, together with their customers, are seeking to shorten the time-to-market for their new products, and that having an effective supply chain is a critical factor in facilitating timely and successful product introductions. Packaging and test service providers have the resources and expertise to timely develop their capabilities and implement new packaging technology in volume. For this reason, semiconductor companies and OEMs are leveraging capabilities of packaging and test service providers to deliver their new products to market more quickly. 

High quality packaging and test service providers enable semiconductor manufacturers to focus their resources on semiconductor design and wafer fabrication. 

As semiconductor process technology migrates to larger wafers and smaller feature sizes, the cost of building a state-of-the-art wafer fabrication factory has risen significantly and can now be several billions of dollars. The high cost of investing in next generation silicon technology and equipment is causing many semiconductor companies to adopt or maintain a &#8220;fabless&#8221; or &#8220;fab-lite&#8221; strategy to reduce or eliminate their investment in wafer fabrication and associated packaging and test operations. As a result, these companies are increasing their reliance on outsourced providers of semiconductor manufacturing services, including packaging and test. 

STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

Strategy 

Our financial goals are sales growth and improved profitability, and we are focusing on the following strategies to achieve these goals: 

Leverage Our Investment in Services for Advanced Technologies 

We are an industry leader in developing and commercializing cost-effective advanced packaging and test technologies. These advanced technology solutions provide increased value to our customers while typically generating gross margins above our corporate average. This is particularly true in the mobile device market, where growth has outpaced the semiconductor industry rate. An important factor for success in the advanced packaging and test area is to generate reasonably quick returns on investments made for customers seeking leading edge technologies. 

&#32;5 

In recent years we have made significant investments in state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to provide services for the industry&#8217;s most complex devices. With approximately 475 &#32;employees engaged in research and development in 2015 focusing on the design and development of new semiconductor packaging and test technologies, we are a technology leader in areas such as fine pitch bumping, advanced flip chip and wafer-level processing. During 2015, we had success capitalizing on our advanced technology to achieve design wins and new product introductions in areas such as chips fabricated at 16 nanometer geometries and advanced SiP products including radio frequency ("RF"), front end modules and micro-electro-mechanical systems ("MEMS") devices. 

We work closely with our customers to develop cost-effective leading-edge packages for the next generation of devices, and are making substantial progress in a number of areas. These include Silicon Wafer Integrated Fan-out Technology ("SWIFT") and Silicon-Less Integrated Module ("SLIM") solutions which enable very thin, very small products combining application processors, memory, baseband and other peripheral IC&#8217;s. They also include packages utilizing Through Silicon Via ("TSV") interconnects and silicon interposers which enable the integration of high performance chips such as high bandwidth memory and graphics processors into a single package. 

We believe that the value added by advanced packaging services will continue to grow as our customers and leading electronics OEMs strive for smaller device geometries, higher levels of speed and performance and lower power consumption. We intend to continue to leverage our investment in advanced technology to meet the demand for these services. 

Improve Utilization of Existing Assets and Broaden Our Customer Base 

Another key to our success is to improve the utilization of our existing assets. The transition by leading edge customers to newer packaging and test equipment platforms typically frees up capacity in existing, previously installed equipment. As part of our strategy, we are focused on developing a second wave of customers to more effectively utilize these assets over a longer period of time. In particular, we have a concerted effort to increase our sales to Chinese and Taiwanese fabless chip companies, since they have a significant portion of the mid-tier and entry-level segments of the mobile device market where much of the growth is occurring. 

In 2015, we established a dedicated Greater China Business Unit, opened new sales offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, and continued hiring new salespeople, design engineers and customer service personnel to assist our customers in China. 

Another key part of our Greater China strategy is our regional manufacturing footprint, particularly our world-class factory in Shanghai. We are building an addition to this facility, which will expand our clean room space by nearly 45%, to a total of roughly 625,000 square feet. Our Shanghai facility serves international and local customers, with a heavy emphasis on wafer-level packaging, wafer bumping, stacked die packaging and advanced test services. 

Selectively Grow Our Scale and Scope through Strategic Investments 

From time to time we see attractive opportunities to grow our customer base and expand markets through strategic investments. For example, in 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100% of J-Devices, our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test ("OSAT") joint venture in Japan. We believe that with this acquisition we have become the largest OSAT by revenue for the automotive market, with roughly $750 million in combined automotive-based revenues in 2015. In addition, Renesas agreed to transfer most of its Singapore-based automotive microcontroller production to J-Devices&#8217; factories. That transfer began in 2015 and will be completed in 2016. 

We believe that selective growth through joint ventures, acquisitions and other strategic investments can help diversify our revenue streams, improve our profits and maintain our technological leadership. 

Competitive Strengths 

The outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive. We also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers and foundries. We believe we are well-positioned 

&#32;6 

in the outsourced packaging and test services market. The following competitive strengths allow us to build upon our industry position and to remain one of the preferred providers of semiconductor packaging and test services. 

Leading Technology Innovator 

We are a leader in developing advanced semiconductor packaging and test solutions. We have designed and developed several state-of-the-art package formats and technologies including our Package-on-Package (&#8220;PoP&#8221;) platform with Through Mold Via (&#8220;TMV&#8221;) technology, FusionQuad, flip chip ball grid array, multi-chip modules with a silicon interposer placed between the module chips and substrate, copper pillar bumping and fine pitch copper pillar flip chip packaging technologies. In addition, we believe that as semiconductor technology continues to achieve smaller device geometries with higher levels of speed and performance, packages will increasingly require wafer-level chip scale packaging, flip chip and advanced integrated and modular interconnect solutions that combine multiple active chips and other elements in a single package. We have been investing in our technology leadership in wafer bumping, wafer-level processing, advanced SiP, SLIM and SWIFT packaging technologies. We have also been a leader in developing environmentally friendly integrated circuit packaging, which involves the elimination of lead and certain other materials. 

The semiconductor industry is now in a period of packaging development where integrated wafer-level fan-out and TSV interconnect technologies will be used to create the next generation of advanced packages. We continue to invest in developing the key processes and packaging and test technologies required for our customers to deliver advanced integrated and modular solutions to market. We are a leader in wafer thinning, micro-bumping and TSV-based flip chip innovation, and we are leveraging our technology development relationships with key customers in diverse applications to develop and deploy these packaging and test solutions. 

Long-Standing Relationships and Collaboration with Prominent Semiconductor Companies 

Our customers include most of the world&#8217;s largest semiconductor companies and over the last four decades, we have developed long-standing relationships with many of these companies. We believe that our production excellence has been a key factor in our success in attracting and retaining customers. We work with our customers and our suppliers to develop proprietary process technologies to enhance our existing capabilities, reduce time-to-market, increase quality and lower costs. 

We believe that our focus on research and product development will enable us to enter new markets early, capture market share and promote the adoption of our new package designs as industry standards. We collaborate with customers and leading OEMs to develop comprehensive packaging solutions that make it easier for next-generation semiconductors to be designed into next-generation end products.

&#8226; 

Providing capabilities and solutions for customer-specific requirements. 

For financial information about geographic areas, see Note 18 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Competitive Cost Structure and Disciplined Capital Investment 

There is a continuous push throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain for lower cost solutions. We work to maintain a competitive cost structure and make disciplined capital investment decisions so that we can provide cost-competitive solutions to our customers and achieve sustainable profitability and cash flow. Some of our cost control efforts have included: (1) improving the utilization of our existing assets; (2) increasing strip densities to drive higher throughput; (3) migrating from gold wire to copper wire for certain wirebond packages and (4) increasing labor productivity. 

We operate in a cyclical industry. During an industry downturn we seek to reduce our costs and drive greater factory and administrative efficiencies. Cost control efforts can include reducing labor costs by temporarily lowering compensation, reducing employee and contractor headcount, shortening work weeks and obtaining labor-related foreign government subsidies where available. 

PACKAGING AND TEST SERVICES 

Overview of Semiconductor Manufacturing Process 

In general, the semiconductor manufacturing process consists of integrated circuit design, wafer fabrication, wafer probe, packaging and final test. 

Integrated circuit design involves the laying out of electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and the metallic interconnect of these components, to achieve the desired device functionality. Wafer fabrication is a multiple-step sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps during which the integrated circuits are gradually created on semiconductor material, typically a silicon wafer. Individual integrated circuits are generally known as a &#8220;chip&#8221; or &#8220;die&#8221;, and a single wafer will contain many die. Wafers are fabricated by two types of companies - IDMs which design and fabricate wafers using their own in-house manufacturing facilities, and contract foundries which manufacture wafers that are designed by fabless companies or other customers. 

The packaging and test services we provide occur subsequent to wafer fabrication. The wafers that we receive from our customers are generally consigned to us; we do not own the consigned wafers or record their value in our financial statements. During wafer probe, each individual die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Packaging is the processing of bare die to facilitate electrical connections and heat dissipation and protect the die. The wafer is separated into individual die. Each good die is then assembled into a package that typically encapsulates the die for protection and creates the electrical connections used to connect the package to a printed circuit board, module or other part of the electronic device. In some packages, chips are attached to a substrate or leadframe carrier through wirebonding or flip chip interconnects and then encased in a protective material. Or, for a wafer-level package, the electrical interconnections are created directly on the surface of the die (while the wafer is still intact) so that the chip may be attached directly to other parts of an electronic 

&#32;8 

device without a substrate or leadframe. The packages are then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each packaged chip meets its design and performance specifications. 

Packaging and Test Technologies and Processes 

Our packages employ wirebond, flip chip, copper clip and other interconnect technologies. We use leadframe and substrate package carriers, and we perform a variety of test services. 

Interconnect Technologies 

Wirebond: In packages that employ wirebond interconnect technology, the die is mounted face up on the package carrier and the interconnections between the die and package carrier are made through very fine gold, silver or copper wires which are attached from the bond pads of the die to the package carrier. Wirebonding is generally considered to be the most cost-effective and flexible interconnect technology and is used to assemble the majority of semiconductor packages. 

Flip Chip: In packages that employ flip chip interconnect technology, the interconnections between the die and package carrier are made through conductive &#8220;bumps&#8221; that are placed directly on the die surface utilizing a process called wafer bumping. The bumped die is then &#8220;flipped over&#8221; and placed face down, with the bumps connecting directly to the package carrier. Flip chip allows a higher number of interconnects than wirebond as it uses the entire surface area of the die, and sometimes the perimeter as well, instead of just the perimeter as used by most wirebond packages. Flip chip also provides enhanced thermal and electrical performance, and enables smaller die and thinner, smaller form factors (or physical package dimensions). 

The wafer bumping process consists of preparing the wafer for bumping and forming or placing the bumps. Preparation may include cleaning, removing insulating oxides and providing a pad metallurgy that will protect the interconnections while making good mechanical and electrical connection between the bump and the wafer. 

Copper Clip : Copper clip interconnect technology uses a solid copper bridge or &#8220;clip&#8221; to connect the die to the package carrier. The clip allows a higher level of current flow than a wire and also provides a better method of heat transfer from the die. The clip is either spot welded, or more often re-flow soldered, to the die pads and the package carrier pads. 

Package Carriers 

Leadframe: A leadframe is a miniature sheet of metal, generally made of copper and silver alloys, on which a pattern of electrical connections (or &#8220;leads&#8221;) has been cut. The leads are generally placed around the perimeter of the leadframe and are used to connect the package to the system board. The number of leads on an individual leadframe is limited as electrical shorting can occur if the leads are placed too close together. 

Substrate: &#160; A substrate is a laminate of multiple layers of epoxy resin, woven glass fibers and metal conductors. Bumps provide the electrical connection to the system board. The bumps are typically distributed evenly across the bottom surface of the substrate (called a &#8220;ball grid array&#8221; format). This allows greater distance between individual leads and a higher number of interconnects than leadframe packages. 

Test Services 

Amkor provides a complete range of semiconductor testing services including wafer testing or probe and final test. We offer a full range of test software, hardware, integration and product engineering services, and we support a range of business models and test capabilities. Substantially all of our test business is derived from testing packages that we assemble. 

Wafer Test Services: &#32;&#32;Wafer test, also referred to as wafer probe, is performed after wafer fabrication or wafer bumping to screen out defective devices prior to packaging. We offer a range of wafer test coverage that can be tailored based on the cost and complexity of the die, the package and the product. These services range from coarse level screening for major defects all the way up to probing at high digital speeds and can include full radio frequency transmit and receive as well as testing at multiple temperatures. Wafer testing can also involve a range of wafer mapping and inspection operations. 

&#32;9 

Final Test Services: &#32;&#32;After the packaging process, final test is performed to ensure that the packaged device meets the customer&#8217;s requirements. Final test spans a range of rigor and complexity depending on the device and end market application. More rigorous types of final test include testing multiple times under different electrical and temperature conditions and before and after device reliability stresses, such as burn-in. In addition to electrical testing, specialized solutions are required for packages that also process non-electric stimuli. 

The electrical tests are a mix of functional, structural and system-level tests depending on the customer&#8217;s requirements and cost and reliability parameters. The electrical test equipment we use includes commercially available automated test equipment, customized and proprietary system level test equipment and innovative types of low cost test equipment developed by Amkor. 

Advanced Products and Mainstream Products 

We offer a broad range of advanced and mainstream packaging and test services to our customers. We refer to our flip chip, wafer-level processing and related test services as &#8220;Advanced Products&#8221;, and our wirebond packaging and related test services as &#8220;Mainstream Products&#8221;. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of advanced and mainstream packaging and test net sales and the percentage of such net sales (excluding J-Devices):

Substantially all of J-Devices' net sales are generated from mainstream packages. J-Devices had net sales of $812.9 million, $923.0 million and $825.1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, we had net sales of approximately $725 million from our advanced SiP modules which are included in either advanced products or mainstream products depending upon the interconnect technology used in the module. 

Advanced System-in-Package ("SiP") Modules 

Advanced SiP modules combine multiple semiconductor components with different functionalities into a single IC package. These modules use wirebond, flip chip or wafer-level interconnect technologies. Additional components can include passive devices (inductors, capacitors, resistors, filters and diplexers), antennas and mechanical parts. 

The increasing demand for miniaturization and higher functionality at competitive cost is driving the adoption of SiP in new products. Advanced SiP modules are used for many applications such as RF and front end modules, baseband processing, connectivity, fingerprint sensors, display and touch screen drivers, sensors and MEMS, NAND memory and solid state drives. Advanced SiP modules are found in many products including smartphones and tablets, automobiles, wearable electronics, high-performance gaming systems, computers and network systems. 

Advanced Products 

Our advanced packages include flip chip chip scale packages, wafer-level chip scale packages and flip chip ball grid array packages. These package families use flip chip interconnect technology so that the die can be connected to a substrate package carrier or, in the case of wafer-level chip scale packages, directly to a printed circuit board. 

Flip Chip Chip Scale Package ("FC CSP") Products : FC CSP packages are small form factor packages where the substrate size is not much larger than the die itself. The size advantage provided by chip scale packaging technologies has made FC CSP an attractive choice for a wide variety of applications that require very small form factors such as smartphones, tablets and other mobile consumer electronic devices. 

&#32;10 

Flip chip stacked chip scale packages ("FC SCSP") stack a second die on top of the original die. The top die is typically a memory device, and wirebond interconnects are used to attach it to the substrate. FC SCSP is frequently used to stack memory on top of digital baseband and applications processors for use in mobile devices. 

We developed fine pitch copper pillar flip chip interconnect technology, which creates interconnections at finer pitches using a plating process to reduce the number of substrate layers to facilitate very thin packages. This innovative solution is also an enabling technology for 2.5D and 3D package stacking with TSVs. 

Wafer-level chip scale packages ("WL CSP") do not utilize a package carrier. The bumped wafer is singulated into individual die, and the wafer-level package is then attached directly to the system board. WL CSP offers one of the lowest total system costs, enabling higher semiconductor content while leveraging the smallest form factor and one of the highest performing, most reliable, semiconductor package platforms on the market today. We have seen significant growth in our WL CSP business, particularly for power management, RF, and integrated connectivity applications. 

Flip Chip Ball Grid Array ("FC BGA") Products : FC BGA packages are large form factor substrate-based packages which are used where processing power and speed are needed, and small form factors are not required. Our FC BGA packages are assembled around state-of-the-art substrates. Utilizing multiple high density routing layers, laser drilled vias, and ultra-fine line and space metallization, FC BGA substrates have the highest routing density available. The variety of FC BGA package options allows package selection to be tailored to the specific thermal needs of the end product. We offer FC BGA packaging in a variety of product formats to fit a wide range of end application requirements, including networking, storage, computing and consumer applications. 

Our Flip Chip Molded BGA ("FCmBGA") packages utilize a molding compound that replaces traditional capillary underfill to interconnect larger die onto a substrate without the structural need for a lid or stiffening ring. This enables thinner packaging and improved thermal performance while reducing system cost. 

Mainstream Packages 

Our mainstream packages include leadframe packages, substrate-based wirebond packages and MEMS packages. These package families use wirebond interconnect technology to connect a die to a leadframe or substrate package carrier. 

Leadframe Packages: &#32;&#32;Leadframe packages use wirebond or flip chip technology to interconnect a die to a leadframe package carrier. Leadframe packages are used in many electronic devices and remain the most practical and cost-effective solution for many low to medium pin count applications. 

Traditional leadframe packages support a wide variety of device types and applications. Two of our most popular traditional leadframe package types are small outline integrated circuit and quad flat package, commonly known as &#8220;dual&#8221; and &#8220;quad&#8221; products, respectively, based upon the number of sides from which the leads extend. The traditional leadframe package family has evolved from &#8220;through hole design,&#8221; where the leads are plugged into holes on the circuit board to &#8220;surface mount design,&#8221; where the leads are soldered to the surface of the circuit board. We offer a wide range of lead counts and body sizes to satisfy variations in the size of customers&#8217; semiconductor devices. 

Through a process of continuous engineering and customization, we have designed several leadframe package types that are thinner and smaller than traditional leadframe packages, and which have the ability to accommodate more leads on the perimeter of the package. These leadframe packages typically have superior thermal and electrical characteristics, which allow them to dissipate heat generated by high-powered semiconductor devices while providing enhanced electrical connectivity. We are developing increasingly smaller versions of these packages to keep pace with continually shrinking semiconductor device sizes and demand for miniaturization of portable electronic products. One of our more successful leadframe package offerings is the Micro LeadFrame family of quad flat no lead packages. 

Power discrete devices use a leadframe as the package carrier and primarily use wirebond interconnect technology. However, power applications that require improved thermal and electrical performance will use packaging with copper clip interconnect technology.

Substrate-based Wirebond Packages : Substrate-based wirebond packages use wirebond technology to connect a die to a substrate. Some of our packages in this category include stacked CSP, chip array ball grid array ("CABGA") packages and plastic ball grid array ("PBGA") packages. 

Stacked CSP technology enables the stacking of a wide range of different semiconductor devices to deliver high levels of silicon integration and area efficiency. Stacked CSP utilizes high density thin core substrates and advanced materials, along with leading-edge wafer thinning, die attach, and molding capabilities to stack multiple die on a substrate. Stacked CSP is ideal for memory, including NAND, NOR and DRAM memory, and mixed signal applications. 

Chip array BGA packages offer a broad selection of ball array pitches, ball counts and body sizes, single and multi-die layouts, stacked die and passive component integration. They are applicable for a wide range of semiconductors requiring a smaller package size than conventional PBGAs or leadframe packages. 

Plastic ball grid array packages are used in applications requiring higher pin count than leadframe packages, but typically have lower pin counts than flip chip. PBGA packages are designed for low inductance, improved thermal operation and enhanced surface-mount technology ability. Custom performance enhancements, like ground and power planes, are also available. 

Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems ("MEMS") Packages : MEMS are miniaturized mechanical and electro-mechanical devices that can sense and provide information about the physical world and sometimes trigger a response. Examples of MEMS devices include microphones, accelerometers, airbag deployment sensors, gyrometers, magnetometers, and humidity, temperature and pressure sensors. MEMS packages leverage our expertise in wafer thinning, die stacking, wirebonding and flip chip interconnect to deliver sophisticated products with a very small form factor. In 2015, we introduced sensor fusion products which utilize our cavity MEMS platform and combine multiple sensors into a single package.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Our research efforts focus on developing new packaging solutions and test services, and improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes. We believe that technology development is one of the keys to success in the semiconductor packaging and test industry. By concentrating our research and development on our customers&#8217; needs for innovative packages, increased performance and lower cost, we gain opportunities to enter markets early, capture market share and promote our new package offerings as industry standards. 

One of our top priorities is developing low-cost packaging solutions for the next generation of mobile devices, which minimize material and processing costs, while maximizing yields and reliability. This development effort is particularly important for customers seeking cost-effective alternatives to further silicon-level integration. Another important focus area is the development of wafer-level packages for larger chips. These wafer-level chip-scale packages are increasingly the preferred package type for many chips used in mobile devices. They provide a very low-profile product at a competitive cost. We are also developing integrated wafer-level fan-out solutions called SWIFT and SLIM which enable very thin, very small products combining application processors, memory, baseband and other peripheral IC&#8217;s. 

&#160; 

Our research and development employees are located throughout Asia and in the United States. In 2015 , we had approximately 475 employees engaged in research and development activities. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we incurred $82.0 million , $76.9 million &#32;and $64.6 million , respectively, of research and development expense. 

&#32;13

SEASONALITY 

Our sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half due to the effect of consumer buying patterns in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the timing of flagship mobile device launches. In addition, semiconductor companies generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of December which results in a decrease in packaging and test services during the first quarter. Generally soft economic conditions and a lack of compelling new mobile products constrained overall demand during 2015. The high-end smartphone market was a particular issue for us in 2015, in part due to the lackluster general market conditions, and in part because of changes in the supply chain which impacted one of our major customers. As a result, we did not see our normal seasonal revenue patterns in 2015. 

&#160; 

&#32;14 

CUSTOMERS 

In 2015 , we had approximately 250 customers, including many of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Our ten largest customers accounted for 63% &#32;of our net sales in 2015. Qualcomm Incorporated and Toshiba each accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2015. 

MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT 

Materials 

Our materials are used primarily for packaging activities. Our packaging operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. The principal materials used in our packaging process are leadframes, laminate substrates, gold and copper wire, mold compound, epoxy, tubes and trays. The silicon wafer is generally consigned from the customer. We do not take ownership of the customer consigned wafer, and title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials. Test materials constitute a very small portion of our total test cost. We purchase materials based on customer forecasts, and our customers are generally responsible for any unused materials which we purchased based on such forecasts. 

We obtain the materials required for packaging services from various suppliers. We source most of our materials, including critical materials such as leadframes, laminate substrates and gold wire, from a limited group of suppliers. We work closely with our primary material suppliers in an effort to ensure that materials are available and delivered on time and, we also negotiate world-wide pricing agreements with our major suppliers to take advantage of the scale of our operations. 

Equipment 

Our ability to meet the changing demand from our customers for manufacturing capacity depends upon obtaining packaging and test equipment in a timely manner. We work closely with our main equipment suppliers to coordinate the ordering and delivery of equipment to meet our expected capacity needs. 

The primary types of equipment used in providing our packaging services are wirebonders and die bonders. In addition, we maintain a variety of other packaging equipment, including mold, singulation, die attach, ball attach and wafer backgrind, along with numerous other types of manufacturing equipment. A substantial portion of our packaging equipment base can generally be used and adapted to support the manufacture of many of our packages through the use of relatively low cost tooling, although equipment used in advanced packaging can be more difficult to redeploy than equipment used in traditional wirebond packaging. 

We also purchase wafer bumping equipment to facilitate our flip chip and wafer level packaging services. Wafer bump equipment includes sputter and spin coaters, electroplating equipment, reflow ovens and other types of equipment. This equipment tends to have longer lead times for delivery and installation than other packaging equipment and is sold in relatively larger increments of capacity. 

The primary equipment used in the testing process includes testers, handlers and probers. Handlers are used to transfer individual or small groups of packaged integrated circuits to a tester. Test equipment is generally a more capital intensive portion of the process and tends to have longer delivery lead times than most types of packaging equipment. We focus our capital expenditures on standardized tester platforms in order to maximize test equipment utilization where possible. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

The semiconductor packaging process uses chemicals, materials and gases and generates byproducts that are subject to extensive governmental regulations. For example, we produce liquid waste when semiconductor wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws, then cooled with running water. In addition, semiconductor packages have historically utilized metallic alloys containing lead (Pb) within the interconnect terminals typically referred to as leads, pins or balls. The usage of lead (Pb) has decreased over the past few years, as we have ramped volume production of alternative lead (Pb)-free processes. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. 

&#32;15 

Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the semiconductor packaging and test industry and may require additional capital investment. 

We are engaged in a continuing program to assure compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect that capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

COMPETITION 

The outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive. We face substantial competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in Asia, including companies with significant manufacturing capacity, financial resources, research and development operations, marketing and other capabilities. These companies include Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. and STATS ChipPAC Ltd, which was acquired by Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co., Ltd in 2015. 

Such companies also have developed relationships with most of the world&#8217;s largest semiconductor companies, including current or potential customers of Amkor. We also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers and the contract foundries. Our IDM customers continually evaluate the attractiveness of outsourced services against their own in-house packaging and test services and at times may decide to shift some or all of their outsourced packaging and test services to internally sourced capacity. We also compete with contract foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., which offer full turnkey services from silicon wafer fabrication through packaging and final test. In addition, we compete with companies that offer only test services and not packaging. 

The principal elements of competition in the semiconductor packaging and test services market include: 

&#8226; 

technical competence; 

&#8226; 

quality; 

&#8226; 

price; 

&#8226; 

breadth of packaging and test services offered, including turnkey services; 

&#8226; 

new package and test design, technology innovation and implementation; 

&#8226; 

cycle times; 

&#8226; 

customer service and 

&#8226; 

available capacity and ability to invest in capacity, geographic location and scale of manufacturing. 

We believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these elements. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We maintain an active program to protect and derive value from our investment in technology and the associated intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad, and their durations vary depending on the jurisdiction in which each patent is filed. Although our patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy as a whole, we are not materially dependent on any one patent or any one technology. We expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies, but we cannot assure you that we will receive patents from pending or future applications. In addition, any patents we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us. 

We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets by maintaining the confidentiality of the information we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We have ongoing programs designed to maintain 

&#32;16 

the confidentiality of such information. Further, to distinguish our products from our competitors&#8217; products, we have obtained certain trademarks and service marks and may promote our particular brands through advertising and other marketing techniques. 

EMPLOYEES 

In 2015 , Amkor had approximately 22,200 full-time employees. On December 30, 2015, we added approximately 4,500 additional employees through our acquisition of J-Devices. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have not experienced a work stoppage in any of our factories. Our employees in Europe, the Philippines, Taiwan and the U.S. are not represented by any union. Certain employees at our factories in China, Japan, Korea and Malaysia are members of a union, and we operate subject to collective bargaining agreements that we have entered into with these unions.
