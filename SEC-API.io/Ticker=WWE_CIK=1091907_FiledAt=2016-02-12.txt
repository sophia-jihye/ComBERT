 It em 1. Business 

WWE is an integrated media and entertainment company. We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for over 30 years, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We develop unique and creative content centered around our talent and present it via our subscription network (&#8220;WWE Network&#8221;) , television, online and at our live events. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars and Divas, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our WWE N etwork, live and televised events, digital media, home entertainment, consumer products and feature films provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans. 

Based on the strength of the Company&#8217;s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content, including our WWE Network, which launched domestically on February 24, 2014, and internationally beginning August 12, 2014 and is now ava ilable internationally in over 18 0 countries . In support o f this initiative, during 2013 and 2014, the Company increased staffing levels and expanded its content production capabilities in preparation for the launch and o ngoing operational needs of WWE N etwork . The launch of WWE Network has been transformative to WWE and &#160; has change d the distributio n of WWE&#8217;s pay-per-view events, and reduced the monetization of our assets through other platforms , such as pay-per-view &#160; and other content distributed on certain digital platforms.

WWE Network 

WWE Network l aunched on February 24, 2014, bec oming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming network. This subscription based network is cur rently available in more than 18 0 countries and territories, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, and Ireland, among others. Subscribers can access all of WWE&#8217;s live pay-per-view events, exclusive original programming and more than 4,300 hours o f our video-on-demand library. The inclusion of our monthly marquis pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania , and the access to original content and live specials are critical components of the programming which drives our viewership engagement and satisfaction. WWE Network content includes exclusive original programming, including Breaking Ground, &#160; Swerved and Stone Cold Podcast as well as exclusive live in-ring specials, including our 2015 broadcasts of The Beast Live from Tokyo , Live from Madison Square Garden , and our live NXT Takeover specials, among others. Our strategy of creating compelling original content for broadcast on WWE Network has contributed to the growth and acceptance of WWE N etwork , as we premiered more than 330 hours of original content during 2015. In addition, the evolution of our NXT division, featuring developmental talent, into a global touring brand that airs weekly taped broadcasts on WWE Network , as well as live eve nt specials during the year, has contributed to the growth and acceptance of WWE N etwork among our fans. 

WWE Network is available on desktops and laptops via WWE.com, through the WWE App on Amazon Fire TV and Kindle Fire devices, Android devices, IOS devices, Apple TV, Roku streaming devices, gam ing consoles, interconnected TV s, Blu-Ray players and Smart TVs. As of December 31, 201 5 , WWE Network had 1,217,100 subscribers as compared to 816,000 subscribers at December 31, 2014, representing a 49% increase in our subscriber base . For domestic subscribers, the current subscription pricing of WWE Network is $9.99 per month with no minimum &#160; commitment , and new subscribers are currently offered a one month free trial . &#160; &#160; 

Network subscription net revenues were $138.8 million and &#160; $69.5 million, representing 21% and 13% of total net revenues in 2015 and 2014 , respectively . 

Pay-Per-View Programming 

Beginning in Febru ary 2014 with the launch of WWE Network, WWE&#8217;s monthly marquis pay-per-view eve nts are included as part of the ne twork subscription. Inclusion of these events as a part of the subscription to WWE Network has resulted in a large decrease of &#225; la carte pay-per-view revenue in the markets where WWE Network is available , and we expect this decline to continue with the continued growth and expansion of WWE Network. 

WWE produced 12 domestic pay-per-view programs in 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 . The suggested domestic retail price for all pay-per-view events in 201 5 was $44.95, with the exception of WrestleMania which had a suggested domestic retail price of $59.95. Consistent with industry practices, we share the revenues with cable systems and satellite providers that distribute the events. Average revenue per buy was $14.68 in 201 5 , $ 19.55 in 201 4 and $ 21.41 in 201 3 . 

Pay-per-view net revenues were $20.6 million, $45.2 million and $82.5 million, representing 3% , 8% and 16% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. &#160; As WWE Network&#8217;s subscriber adoption rate increases, we expect that our pay-per-view programming a la carte purchases will continue to decline. 

Television 

Relying on our in-house production capabilities at our technologically advanced, high definition, production facility, we produce five hours of original weekly domestic television programming , which include RAW and SmackDown . RAW and SmackDown are licensed domestically under a multi-year contract with NBC Universal , which became effective on October 1, 2014. Second runs of RAW and SmackDown are also available on WWE Network 30 days after the original first run airing dates on television. &#160; We also produce reality shows and other programming. Our television &#160; programming is distributed domestically and internationally. Our domestic television programs currently are: RAW on USA Network with replays on NBC Universo and Uni HD; SmackDown , &#160; which recently moved from Syfy to USA Network on January 7, 2016, w ith replays on NBC Universo ; and Total Divas on E! Network. WWE&#8217;s TV programs reach over 11 million viewers in the United States during the average week . USA Network, the Syfy Channel, E! Network and NBC Universo are owned by NBC Universal. 

RAW is a three-hour live primetime program which ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW , which has been on air for 2 2 years, is the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history and anchors USA, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable network. 

&#160;

SmackDown is a two-hour show which aired in primetime on Fridays before moving to Thursdays on January 15, 2015. Prior to moving to the USA Network in January 2016, SmackDown ha d on average been Syfy&#8217;s most-watched program each week. SmackDown is the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, only behind RAW . 

Total Divas was added to WWE's programming line-up in July 2013, continued to air Sundays on E! beginning with an eleven episode run of Season 2 earl ier in 2014, and ended 2014 with the first ten episodes of Season 3. The second half of Season 3 began airing in January 2015 and Season 4 aired in 2015 . The reality based show explores life beyond the ring for several WWE Divas. Previous episodes of Seasons 1 through 4 &#160; are also replayed on WWE Network. 

WWE&#8217;s television programming can be seen in mo re than 160 countries and 24 languages around the world. O ur broadcast partners include: Sky in the United Kingdom; Ten Sports in India, and Rogers Communication in Canada , among many others. 

Television net revenues were $231.1 million, $ 176.7 million and $ 163.4 milli on, representing 35% , 33% and 32 % of total net revenues in 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively. 

Home Entertainment 

WWE distributes its content as home entertainment releases in both physical (DVD and Blu-R ay) and digital formats. Content distributed through home entertainment channels has included themed compilations from the Company&#8217;s vast archives as well as releases of the Company&#8217;s pay-per-view events. WWE&#8217;s home entertainment titles are generally sold through retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy and via subscription and transactional on-demand outlets, such as iTunes, Amazon, and others. Outside the United States, third-party licensees distribute our home entertainment releases. Starting in January 2015, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment has become the domestic distributor of our home entertainment products. 

&#160; The gradual shift by consumers to digital formats downloaded or streamed over the Internet has negatively impacted our volume of DVD and Blu-Ray disc sales. In addition, we believe the launch of WWE Network, which includes access to WWE&#8217;s video-on-demand library that includes many titles that are also available in DVD, Blu-Ray disc and digital formats, has also contributed to the decline i n our Home Entertainment sales. In 2015 , we released 28 new home video productions domestically and, in the U.S., shipped approximately 2.1 million DVD and Blu-R ay units, including catalog titles released in prior years. This compares to 2.7 million DVD and Blu-Ray units shipped in the U.S. in 2014 , as we released 30 new home video productions domestically . 

Home entertainment net revenues were $13.4 million, $27.3 million and $24.3 million, representing 2% , 5% and 5% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Digital Media 

WWE utilizes the Internet to promote our brands, create a community experience among our fans, market and distribute our content and digital products and sell online advertising. Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of 20.6 &#160; million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 201 5 . Thes e visitors viewed an average of 406 mill ion pages and approximately 38.5 million video streams per month. WWE wallpapers, ringtones, voicetones, games and videos are available through our mobile partnerships. 

WWE currently has l anguage- based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. Currently, the available languages are English, French, German, Polish and Arabic. We have relationships with local sales agencies to sell advertising on WWE.com, which spans over more than 7 0 countries . Most of these arrangements allow a partner to sell advertising across a region of countries. 

WWE currently streams its video content on select video portals such as YouTube and Facebook. On YouTube, WWE consistently ranks among the top viewed channels and our viewership on Facebook is gaining more popularity . During 2015, there were 8.1 billion views of WWE content on YouTube garnering the Company advertising revenues attached to the content. &#160; 

Total Digital Media net revenues were $21.5 million, $20.9 million and $28.7 million, representing 3% , 4% and 6% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Live Events 

( represents 19 %, 20% and 22% of our net revenues in 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively) 

Our broad and talented roster of Superstars and Divas allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international deman d for our events. Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in monthly marquis events airing on WWE Network and also distributed via pay-per-view. 

&#160;

In 201 5 , we produced 273 live events throughout North America, entertaining approximately 1.6 million fans at an average ticket price of $53.22 . We hold many of our live events at major arenas across the country. In addition to providing content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters. 

In 201 5 , we produced 56 live events internationally, reaching app roximately 407 ,000 fans at an average ticket price of $65.10 . These events were spread over several international tours throughout Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Australia. 

Live events net revenues were $124.7 million, $110.7 million and $113.1 million, representing 19% , 20% and 22% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Consumer Products Division 

( represents 15% , 14 % and 1 5 % of our net revenues in 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively) 

Licensing 

We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of retail products, including toys, video games, apparel and books. Currently, we have relationships with more than 150 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. &#160; Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business. In 2015, we entered into a joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, LLC (&#8220;ABG&#8221;), a brand development and licensing company, to relaunch Tapou t , a newly repositioned lifestyle fitness apparel brand in which WWE has a 50% ownership interest . The eventual launch of the Tapou t brand has the potential to enable WWE to expand into new product categories as well as increase the reach of o ur brand to a broader audience. 

Video games and toys are the largest components of our licensing program. We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc. our master toy licensee, covering all global territories and a mu lti-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") who publishes our &#160; branded video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K , available on PlayStation and XBOX platforms and on iOS and Android devices and WWE SuperCard which is available on iOS and Android devices. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games as d ownloadable content through an I nternet connected device . A ccordingly, both our WWE 2K and WWE SuperCard video g ames can be downloaded via the I nternet and also contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enha nce game play. 

Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record most of our music, including Superstar and Diva entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performe d by popular artists. 

Licensing net revenues were $48.9 million, $38.6 million and $43.6 million, representing 7% , 7% and 9% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

WWE Studios 

( represents 1 %, 2% and 2% of our net revenues in 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively) 

WWE Studios oversees the Company&#8217;s participation in the production and global distribution of filmed entertainment content, which may include movies for theatrical, home entertainment, and/or television release. The Company believes its movie business expands its brands by reaching new audiences, supporting the Company&#8217;s investment in its Superstar and Diva talent, and building a content library with lasting value. 

Our WWE Studios business model focuses on the utilization of strategic partnerships, including production, distribution and acquisition relationships, to increase financial returns and mitigate risk. WWE utilizes its marketing and content platforms, especially its weekly presence on prime-time television, to support its movie projects. 

To enhance WWE Studios&#8217; financial flexibility and capacity to produce and acquire more branded and genre films, in May 2015, WWE Studios entered into a $35 million secured asset based revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the &#8220;Film Credit Facility&#8221;). The funds from the Film Credit Facility will allow WWE Studios to execute further on its key strategy for long-term growth and increasing the number of mid- size budget films on its slate. 

In 201 5, WWE Studios released six films. Among the film projects, WWE Studios joined with Warner Brothers Animation to co-produce and co-finance The Flintstones &#38; WWE: Stone Age SmackDown . WWE Studios also partnered with 20 th Centur y Fox to release The Marine 4: Moving Target &#160; direct to DVD, and released &#160; Vendetta , 12 Rounds 3: Lockdown and The Condemned 2 via limited theatrical distribution with Lionsgate . Additionally, Santa&#8217;s Little Helper , a direct to DVD film, premiered on DVD and then capped off USA Network&#8217;s holiday WWE W eek programming event s . 

WWE Studios net revenues were $7.1 million, $10.9 million and $10.8 million, representing 1% , 2% and 2% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

International &#160; 

Revenues generated outside of North America across all our business segments were $169.8 million , $116. 4 million and $ 116.3 million , representing 26% , 21% and 23% of total net revenues &#160; in &#160; 2015, 2014 and 201 3, respectively. Revenues generated in the United Kingdom, our largest international market, were $75.7 m illion, $ 40.5 million and $3 6 .0 million for 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively. &#160; During 2015, we launched WWE Network in the United Kingdom, Italy, Middle East, Malaysia and India. We also renewed television partnerships with Sky Italia in Italy. In January 2016 the Company made WWE N etwork available in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan and has continued to develop plans for geographic expansion to China, Thailand and the Philippines. Global expansion of WWE Network and television distribution continues to be the primary drivers of growth for our international business. &#160; 

See Note 19 of the c onsolidated f inancial s tatements included in this report for additional information by segment and by geographic area. 

Creative Development and Production 

Headed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent K. McMahon, our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all of our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company&#8217;s reputation for family friendly entertainment. 

Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars and Divas. We currently have approximately 150 Superstars and Divas under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars and Divas &#160; to developmental contracts with our Superstars and Divas in training. Our Superstars and Divas are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all of our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars and Divas. We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. 

Talent Development 

We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our NXT division, which is growing in popularity, features developmental talent training to become WWE Superstars and Divas. NXT has produced current main roster stars such as Seth Rollins , Bray Wyatt , Kevin Owens , and Sasha Banks . NXT has now evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a global touring brand broadcasting live specials on WWE Network throughout the year. NXT &#160; 

&#160;

talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and is a central part of our talent development program. 

Competition 

While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live, television, WWE Network, pay-per-view and movie audiences , we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment , and other leisure activities. We compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. W e will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content , as streamed media offerings continue to expand . &#160; Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do. 

Trademarks and Copyrights 

Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-&#224;-vis other parties&#8217; intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art. We also own a large number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide. 

We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others&#8217; intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results. 

Financial Information about Segments 

See Note 19 of the &#160; c onsolidated financial s tatements, which is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for financial information about each of our segments. 

Employees 

As of February 201 6 , we had approximately 840 employees . This headcount excludes our Superstars and Divas , who are independent contractors. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a union. 

Regulation 

Live Events 

In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results. 

Television and WWE Network Programming 

Our production of programming is generally not dir ectly regulated by federal or state governments in the United States. However , the marketplace for programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political infl uences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels . &#160; Domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance. Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and adversely affect our levels of viewership and/or number of WWE Network subscribers and operating results.
