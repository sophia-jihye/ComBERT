 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad pipeline of microRNA-based oncology therapeutics. microRNAs are naturally occurring, short ribonucleic acid, or RNA, molecules, or oligonucleotides, that play a critical role in regulating key biological pathways. Misexpression of even a single microRNA can contribute to disease development and tumor suppressor microRNAs are commonly reduced in cancer. Our scientists and others at leading academic institutions have identified numerous tumor suppressor microRNAs that play key roles in preventing normal cells from becoming cancerous and facilitating proper cancer immunosurveillance. We are developing mimics of naturally occurring microRNAs that are designed to restore this tumor suppressor activity and aid appropriate anti- tumor immune response. This approach is known as microRNA replacement therapy. 

&#160; 

Our lead product candidate, MRX34, a mimic of naturally occurring microRNA-34 (miR-34) encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation, is the first microRNA mimic to enter clinical development and has demonstrated clinical proof of concept as a single agent in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. As a result of observations in the Phase 1 study, we plan to advance into two Phase 2 clinical studies by the end of 2016, one in patients with advanced malignant melanoma, the other in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We also plan to initiate, in the second half of 2016, an additional Phase 1b translational medicine trial to deepen our insights into the mechanism of action of miR-34 in melanoma patients and to define biomarkers that would aid in furthering the development of MRX34. 

&#160; 

We believe that microRNA mimics may represent a new paradigm in cancer therapy and have the potential to create a new, important class of effective cancer drugs that can potentially be used alone or in combination with other cancer therapeutics. Over the past two decades, cancer drug development has moved from systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. First &#8209;generation targeted therapies have generally produced lower levels of toxicity than systemic cytotoxic therapies; however, they have done so with variable efficacy outcomes. The recent discoveries of checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno &#8209;oncology products have resulted in marked improvements in efficacy. However, only a subset of patients achieve responses to these products when used as a single agent and the development of combinations of these agents has been limited by toxicities. For the next wave of cancer therapies to produce a measurable improvement over current approaches, we believe it will need to yield drugs that can disrupt multiple oncogenic and immuno &#8209;oncology pathways. We believe the microRNA field represents a highly promising area for the development of these drugs. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our corporate strategy includes the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Advance our lead product candidate, MRX34, through clinical development. MRX34 is potentially the first in a new class of promising cancer drugs. Mirna is the first to establish clinical proof &#8209;of &#8209;concept for a microRNA &#8209;based replacement therapy for cancer. In our Phase 1 clinical trial we have achieved confirmed partial responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in a patient with metastasized hepatocellular carcinoma, a patient with advanced acral melanoma and a patient with advanced RCC. We have also observed a number of patients with long term stable disease during MRX34 

&#160;

treatment. Based on the observed clinical activity, we intend to initiate two Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with melanoma and RCC by the end of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Identify biomarkers to support therapeutic product candidates. We believe that biomarkers may be used to monitor microRNA activity and potentially aid in the selection of optimal patient segments in clinical trials. We are analyzing clinical samples supplemented with cell and animal model studies to identify predictive biomarkers that may assist in both demonstrating delivery into and biological activity of miRNA mimics in patient cells. These studies may also assist in selecting patients most likely to benefit from treatment with MRX34 or other product candidates. We also intend to initiate, in late 2017, a dedicated Phase 1b translational medicine study in melanoma patients to further study the mechanism of action and therapeutic activity of MRX34. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expand our clinical development program to additional microRNAs. Our R&#38;D team&#8217;s discoveries of tumor suppressor microRNAs critical for controlling various cancer processes, have allowed us to build a broad pipeline of promising tumor suppressor microRNA mimics. Furthermore, any additional Investigational New Drug (IND), applications that we file may create new development, commercialization and partnering opportunities. With additional insights on microRNA-based drug characteristics from our translational medicine clinical trial, we aim to complete selection of a second product candidate by the end of 2016, which we intend to move into IND-enabling preclinical studies in 2017. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expand our intellectual property position. We intend to continue building on our technology platform, comprised of intellectual property, proprietary methods and know &#8209;how in the microRNA field. We are pursuing or have been granted therapeutic use patent claims related to several tumor suppressor microRNAs, as well as composition of matter claims for multiple chemistries and structures that are actually or potentially used with miR-34 and our other therapeutic microRNA mimics. We believe our strong intellectual property position can be used to support internal development as well as partnering opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage partnership and collaboration opportunities. To date, we have focused on establishing proof &#8209;of &#8209;concept for MRX34, but we anticipate exploring certain partnership opportunities in the future. These may include certain ex &#8209;U.S. territories where we do not expect to establish a commercial presence and R&#38;D partnerships to further expand our pipeline or our MRX34 combination therapy development program. In these cases, we anticipate retaining or sharing U.S. commercialization rights. We may also pursue partnerships for our additional product candidates as they progress toward clinical development. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Biology of microRNAs: A Unique Class in the RNA Therapeutics Space 

RNA plays an essential role in the process used by cells to encode and translate genetic information from DNA to proteins. RNA is comprised of subunits called nucleotides and is synthesized from a DNA template by a process known as transcription. Transcription generates different types of RNA, including messenger RNAs that carry the information for proteins in the sequence of their nucleotides. In contrast, microRNAs are short RNAs, or oligonucleotides, that do not code for proteins, but rather ensure that the over 20,000 human protein &#8209;encoding genes are produced in the proper cells and at the proper levels by coordinating the production of proteins from messenger RNAs that are produced in each cell, a process known as translation. 

In humans, each microRNA binds to and regulates the translation of up to several hundred target messenger RNAs. Coordinating the translation of multiple, related genes allows a microRNA to regulate gene networks involved in key biological pathways. Given the importance of microRNAs in coordinating gene expression, it is not surprising that the altered expression of even a single microRNA appears to contribute to a variety of human diseases, including cancer. 

We believe that microRNA &#8209;based therapies have the potential to become a new class of drugs with broad therapeutic application based on the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

microRNAs are misexpressed in a broad range of diseases. Comparing the microRNA profiles of diseased and normal adjacent tissues from patients with cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, viral infections and a variety of other conditions has revealed consistent alterations in the expression of several microRNAs for each disease. Animal model studies have further revealed that the altered expression of many of these microRNAs contributes to the development of the disease. 

&#183; 

microRNA therapeutics have the potential to modulate multiple disease pathways. microRNAs are known to regulate gene networks involved in key biological pathways. Because of this unique attribute, the use of microRNA therapeutics may allow for more effective treatment of complex, multi &#8209;factorial diseases, such as cancer, in which multiple disease pathways are affected. 

&#183; 

Synergies with other therapies. In complex therapeutic areas, such as cancer, physicians typically treat patients with combination therapies, and we believe microRNA &#8209;based replacement therapy has the potential to become part of that treatment paradigm. Nonclinical data suggest that microRNA therapeutics and different therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies or potentially also immuno &#8209;oncology agents, may work synergistically to treat cancer. 

Our microRNA Platform 

More than 10 years ago, while working at Ambion &#174; , our scientists discovered through extensive microRNA expression and functional assay work that microRNAs are expressed differently in cancer tissue compared to normal adjacent tissue and that several naturally occurring microRNAs function as tumor suppressors by regulating the expression of key oncogenes and preventing the development, progression and dissemination of cancer. 

To enable therapeutic application of these tumor suppressor microRNAs, we pioneered technologies for creating RNA molecules that function as natural microRNAs when they enter human cells. These RNA molecules, which we call microRNA mimics, may be used to replace those tumor suppressor microRNAs that are lost, or under &#8209;expressed, in cancer cells. We pioneered the development of therapeutic miRNA mimics that feature two complementary RNA strands that are hybridized to produce a double &#8209;stranded RNA. The active strand has a sequence that is identical to a microRNA normally expressed in a cell, while the second, passenger strand is modified to facilitate proper loading of the active strand onto the cytoplasmic protein complex necessary for microRNA function inside the cells. While similar in structure, microRNA mimics are clearly differentiated from small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through their biological heritage and activity. In contrast to the man &#8209;made sequences of siRNAs that target a single gene, microRNA mimics function like naturally occurring microRNAs to orchestrate the expression of many different genes to enable normal cell development and function. We believe our microRNA mimics have the mechanistic flexibility to be used as: 

&#183; 

first &#8209;line agents in combination with current standards of care, including targeted therapies, immuno &#8209;oncology therapies, chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies; 

&#183; 

monotherapies in advanced or refractory patient settings; 

&#183; 

monotherapies in patients who would be intolerant of current standards of care; and 

&#183; 

monotherapies in tumor settings that do not have any approved therapies. 

&#160; 

Delivery of microRNA Mimics to Target Tissues 

&#160; 

Systemic delivery of oligonucleotides, including microRNAs, has been a major challenge, principally due to the fact that after intravenous administration these molecules have to overcome multiple barriers before reaching their ultimate place of action, which is the RNA &#8209;induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm of cells. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have evaluated a wide variety of proprietary delivery systems with our microRNA compounds for in vivo and ex vivo testing. As a result of our testing, we selected SMARTICLES &#174; formulation technology, licensed from Marina Biotech, Inc. as our delivery technology for miR &#8209;34, based on high therapeutic activity of formulated miR &#8209;34 in mouse models of cancer. 

&#160; 

We remain confident in our selection of SMARTICLES for our lead therapeutic candidate. However, we continue to evaluate new delivery technologies for potential use in conjunction with miR-34 and the other microRNA mimics in our pipeline for the purposes of optimizing delivery of our drug candidates to a broader group of tissues and organs. 

&#160; 

Selection of miR &#8209;34 as Lead Therapeutic Target 

miR &#8209;34 is one of the most widely published tumor suppressor microRNAs. Studies have revealed that the levels of miR &#8209;34 are reduced in the tumors of patients with a wide variety of cancers, as set forth in the graph below. 

A number of factors could lead to under-expression of miR-34 in cancers, including mutation or methylation of the gene that encodes for miR-34, or mutation or reduced activity of p53, a well-known tumor suppressor protei n. miR-34 was initially discovered as a part of the p53 DNA-repair pathway, and functions similarly to the tumor suppressor function of p53, controlling many genes and pathways that are also associated with p53. 

Based on published reports from microRNA scientists at numerous research institutions, miR &#8209;34 plays a key role in controlling the expression of more than 30 oncogenes as well as genes involved in tumor immune evasion, as shown in the figure below. This includes targets that are the focus of currently &#8209;marketed and investigational cancer drugs. 

&#160;

The considerable reduction of miR &#8209;34 levels observed in cancer stem cells suggests that the microRNA might play a functional role in preventing normal cells from acquiring stem &#8209;like properties, such as cell self &#8209;renewal, which can contribute to the development of cancer. In partnership with an academic collaborator, we successfully demonstrated that introducing miR &#8209;34 into prostate cancer stem cell populations can significantly reduce their stem &#8209;like properties and limit their capacity to form tumors. Similar results have been obtained from studies using pancreatic and gastric cancer stem cells. We believe the ability of miR &#8209;34 to inhibit cancer stem cells has significant implications for cancer therapy since the cancer stem cells present in tumors are thought to be the primary drivers of tumor growth, metastasis and resistance to therapy. 

Recent data generated with an academic collaborator showed that miR &#8209;34 directly represses the checkpoint signaling molecule PD &#8209;L1. PD &#8209;L1 protein present on tumor and immune cells can silence anti &#8209;tumor immune responses and has become a promising drug target in immuno &#8209;oncology therapies. The introduction of miR &#8209;34 mimics into cultured lung cancer cells led to a decline of PD &#8209;L1 protein expression. In a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer, we successfully demonstrated that MRX34 treatment led to repression of the PD &#8209;L1 protein in tumor tissue and an increase in active tumor &#8209;infiltrating immune cells (CD8+) and a decrease in so &#8209;called exhausted tumor &#8209;infiltrating immune cells (CD8+PD1+). We believe the ability of miR &#8209;34 to block PD &#8209;L1 expression may broaden the therapeutic application of MRX34 as a monotherapy as well as in combination with other immuno &#8209;oncology therapies. 

Product Pipeline 

We are developing a pipeline of tumor suppressor microRNA mimics. Each microRNA mimic in our pipeline is designed to replicate the activity of a single tumor suppressor miRNA and regulate the expression of key oncogenes across multiple oncogenic pathways which can prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The potential capacity to simultaneously affect multiple pathways and processes that are critical to cancer cell viability may make mircroRNA mimics potent anti-cancer agents, which may also be less susceptible to developing drug resistance. We are pursuing or have been granted therapeutic use patent claims related to several tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as composition of matter claims for multiple chemistries and structures that are, or may be used in or are contemplated for use with, our 

&#160;

therapeutic microRNA mimics, including miR-34. The following chart lists the most advanced microRNA mimics in our pipeline as well as their current stage of research and development: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MRX34: Our Lead Clinical Product Candidate 

&#160; 

MRX34 is a double &#8209;stranded RNA mimic of the tumor suppressor microRNA, miR &#8209;34, encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation called SMARTICLES. miR &#8209;34 inhibits multiple oncogenic pathways and stimulates anti &#8209;tumor immune response to induce cancer cell death. During preclinical development, we demonstrated that a double-stranded mimic of miR-34 has the ability to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reduce the proliferation of cultured cancer cells derived from patients with a wide range of malignancies, including liver, lung, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

cause significant tumor regression in multiple mouse models of liver cancer and inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of other cancers; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reduce the tumor-forming capacity of cancer stem cell populations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

work in a synergistic manner with different approved cancer therapies to reduce proliferation of cultured cancer cells and cause significant tumor regression in combination with an approved cancer therapy in an aggressive mouse model of liver cancer; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

repress programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression in tumor tissue in a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer, leading to an increase in active tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD8+) and a decrease in so-called exhausted tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD8+PD1+). 

&#160; 

Based on strong preclinical data and a potential compelling new mechanism for the treatment of cancer, we opened IND applications in the United States and Korea and initiated our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial, titled MRX34-101. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MRX34-101 Our Phase 1 Clinical Trial 

&#160; 

Trial Design 

&#160; 

MRX34-101 is a multi-center, open label Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate MRX34 as a single agent in multiple advanced solid tumors and various hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple myeloma). 

&#160; 

Primary objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trial are to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and an appropriate dose for expansion cohorts and future Phase 2 clinical trials. Secondary objectives of the clinical trial are to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of MRX34 after intravenous dosing as well as to assess any biological and clinical activity to determine next clinical development steps. 

&#160; 

The Phase 1 clinical trial design consists of an initial dose-escalation phase, followed by an expansion phase after a MTD and recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) are identified. During the expansion phase of the trial, patients being treated at the RP2D may undergo tumor biopsies to identify potential biomarkers for assessing delivery and activity of miR-34, and/or predicting response to MRX34. The Phase 1 clinical trial is not designed to show statistical significance of the study endpoints. 

&#160; 

The trial was initiated in April 2013 and as of December 31, 2015, 122 patients in total have been enrolled across all patient cohorts and all dose levels at five sites in the United States and three sites in Korea, including 99 patients with various advanced solid tumors and 23 patients with hematological malignancies. 

&#160; 

Two dosing schedules have been studied in the clinical trial. The first consisted of treatment twice weekly or BIW, for three weeks in 28-day cycles (the BIW schedule). The second includes treatment daily for five consecutive days, or QD &#215; 5, in 21-day cycles (the QD &#215; 5 schedule). 

&#160; 

Safety Profile 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

47 advanced solid tumor patients have been treated on the BIW schedule, The MTD of MRX34 was found to be 110 mg/m 2 among patients with advanced solid tumors with liver involvement. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The other 52 advanced solid tumor patients and the 23 patients with hematological malignancies have been or are being treated on the QD &#215; 5 schedule. The MTD and RP2D of MRX34 with this dosing schedule have been established at 70 mg/m 2 for primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC) patients and 93 mg/m 2 for non-HCC solid tumor patients. 

&#160; 

Patients treated on the QD &#215; 5 dosing schedule demonstrated higher drug exposure based on pharmacokinetic parameters, and better treatment tolerability. Based on these observations, we have selected the QD &#215; 5 dosing as the preferred dosing schedule for all new patients enrolled in our clinical trials. 

&#160; 

In the dose escalation portion of our Phase 1 trial of MRX34, patients were treated starting at the 10 mg/m 2 BIW and the 33 mg/m 2 QD x 5 dose level, respectively. During and after intravenous drug infusion, nearly all patients experienced at least one adverse event, with fever, chills, back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, anorexia, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, cough, insomnia, dysgeusia, tachycardia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and hyponatremia being the most commonly reported adverse events. Many of the most common adverse events associated with MRX34 are similar to those reported with other liposomal drug formulations and are generally manageable or preventable with standard interventions or tests used by oncologists, such as administering other medications that prevent or reduce side effects, 

&#160;

including high dose dexamethasone before, during, and shortly after MRX34 infusions, temporary slowing of infusions, delaying or stopping dosing, or using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to detect silent brain metastases. 

&#160; 

Through December 31, 2015, two deaths have occurred in the Phase 1 study, which were considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigators. One treatment &#8209;related death occurred in a 77 &#8209;year old patient with kidney cancer metastasized to the lungs. We believe that the patient experienced immune &#8209;mediated pneumonitis and colitis, which have been observed with immuno &#8209;oncology drugs and are included in FDA &#8209;approved drug labels. The second treatment-related death that was considered possibly related to drug occurred in a 73-year old patient with advanced metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who expired from sepsis . 

&#160; 

The treatment &#8209;related serious adverse events occurring in more than one patient were as follows (as of December 31, 2015): 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Among the 47 patients in the BIW dosing cohort, fever, fatigue, dehydration and elevation of liver enzymes, each occurred in two patients. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

For the 75 patients in the QD &#215; 5 dosing cohort, capillary leak syndrome, delirium or altered mental status, and bleeding in silent or asymptomatic HCC brain metastasis each occurred in two patients; elevation of liver enzymes, fever, and thrombocytopenia each occurred in four patients. In both cases of capillary leak syndrome the patients were receiving low-dose dexamethasone (4 mg BID). Following these safety events the investigators were instructed to use high-dose dexamethasone (10 mg BID) as premedication for all patients and to administer high-dose corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater capillary leak syndrome. 

&#160; 

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 

&#160; 

Both maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) of, and drug exposure (area under the curve, or AUC) to, miR &#8209;34 showed a non &#8209;linear, non &#8209;dose proportional increase with increasing doses in both the BIW and QD &#215; 5 schedules in blood samples analyzed as of December 31, 2015. We believe that the higher exposure with 5 days of consecutive daily dosing is a benefit of the QD &#215; 5 schedule as compared to the BIW schedule. 

&#160; 

We demonstrated a dose dependent repression of miR34 target oncogenes in patients treated with MRX34 using independent, quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analyses in white blood cells from patients treated with MRX34 in the QD &#215; 5 dosing schedule. In addition, we confirmed that miR34 is delivered to the liver tumors in MRX34 treated patients, using chromogenic miR-34a in situ hybridization (CISH). Based on available liver core biopsies to date, we have been able to demonstrate delivery of MRX34 to normal hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and polygonal-shaped melanoma tumor cells. We are now determining the local activity of the miR-34a mimic in these liver and tumor tissues. Based on these data, we believe that the systemic administration of MRX34 to patients with different cancer types increased the levels of active miR &#8209;34 in white blood cells and reduced the levels of biological targets of the miRNA. 

&#160; 

Efficacy Observations 

&#160; 

In the BIW cohort, 47 patients were treated, including 14 patients with advanced primary liver cancer and 33 with other solid tumors. Within this cohort, 38 patients were evaluable for response, based on availability of baseline and follow-up scans or clinical disease progression as determined by the study investigators. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

One primary liver cancer patient achieved a confirmed partial response after six cycles of treatment per independent radiology review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. RECIST criteria are the standard method for evaluating solid tumor response in oncology clinical trials. This patient had a history of hepatitis-B infection and metastases to the lungs. After initial liver tumor resection, the patient was enrolled into the 70 mg/m 2 dose cohort of MRX34 on the BIT schedule. As of December 31, 2015, the patient showed continued confirmed partial response after 13 cycles and stable disease after 15 cycles (more than one year). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

In addition, six of the 38 evaluable patients showed stable disease varying between two and eight cycles in length as determined by the study investigators, and at various dose levels. 

&#160; 

In the QD &#215; 5 cohort, 52 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled as of December 31, 2015. Within this cohort, 28 patients had primary liver cancer, two had RCC, two had acral melanoma and 20 had other types of solid tumors. Dosing in the QD &#215; 5 cohort is ongoing. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

One of two acral melanoma patients achieved a confirmed partial response per independent radiology review using RECIST criteria after receiving four cycles of MRX34 treatment in the 110 mg/m 2 dose cohort. This patient entered our MRX34-101 trial with metastatic disease that had progressed after multiple previous treatments, including thumb amputation, therapy with Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) infusion and IL-2, ipilimumab (Yervoy &#174; ) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda &#174; ). Despite a confirmed partial response the patient decided to discontinue study participation due to study fatigue after 7 cycles of MRX34 treatment. However, as of December 31, 2015 and after more than four months of no treatment with MRX34 or any other agents, the patient remained in confirmed partial response. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

One of the two metastatic RCC patients also achieved a confirmed partial response per independent radiology review using RECIST criteria after receiving three cycles of MRX34 treatment in the 110 mg/m 2 dose cohort. This patient entered our trial with advanced metastatic RCC that had progressed after kidney resection, previous treatment with sunitinib (Sutent &#174; ), and subsequently progressed on temsirolimus (Torisel &#174; ) and bevacizumab (Avastin &#174; ). After three cycles of therapy with MRX34, treatment was discontinued due to rising liver enzymes, later shown on biopsy to be due to immune hepatitis. As of December 31, 2015, including more than four months of no treatment with MRX34 or any other agent, the patient remained in confirmed partial response. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The long-term responses observed in the two patients who achieved confirmed partial responses in the QD &#215; 5 schedule may indicate an immune-mediated effect, which we intend to study further in the ongoing expansion cohorts, and the planned Phase 1b translational medicine trial and two Phase 2 studies. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Furthermore, 13 of the 52 patients have shown stable disease with durations between two and 16 cycles of treatment, and at various dose levels. This includes 10 HCC patients with stable disease varying between 2 and 7 months, and one SCLC patient who started MRX34 on the QD &#215; 5 schedule in the 50 mg/m 2 dose cohort as a fourth line therapy and who achieved long term stable disease for 16 cycles before disease progression. 

&#160; 

Aside from several patients who achieved stable disease, no meaningful clinical response was observed in the 23 patients enrolled with hematological malignancies. 

&#160; 

Expansion Phase (Ongoing) 

&#160; 

After completion of the dose-escalation phase in the QD &#215; 5 dosing schedule in late 2015, we initiated several tumor-specific expansion cohorts in our ongoing Phase 1 study, including primary liver cancer, melanoma, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Objectives of the expansion cohorts are to gain further clinical Phase 1 experience with MRX34 and where possible obtain additional tumor biopsy samples for pharmacodynamic evaluations. Although we initially planned to enroll approximately 80 to 100 patients in the Phase 1 expansion cohort, we now expect to enroll approximately 33 patients across these cohorts prior to initiating our Phase 1b translational medicine study and the Phase 2 studies in melanoma and RCC (to be discussed below). 

&#160; 

We plan to provide a clinical update on the Phase 1 clinical trial mid-2016 and top-line data mid-2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

MRX34 Development Plan 

Following review of available clinical data from the MRX34-101 trial to date as well as consultation with oncology experts, our MRX34 development plan is set forth below. 

&#160; 

We plan to advance two Phase 2 clinical studies by the end of 2016, one study in patients with advanced malignant melanoma, and the other in patients with advanced RCC. We intend for the design of the two studies to be based on the Simon's two-stage Minimax design (Simon, R. minimax two-stage designs for phase II clinical trials, Control Clin Trials, 1989, 10:1). For the Phase 2 study in melanoma, the Company intends to submit the study protocol to its open IND for MRX34 at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) as part of the normal course of study start up. For the renal cell carcinoma study, which will be reviewed by a separate group within the Oncology Drug Review division at the FDA, we intend to request a pre-IND meeting with this division and incorporate any advice the FDA might provide in a new IND that we expect to submit to the FDA for MRX34 in that indication later in 2016. We anticipate enrolling approximately 30 patients in each study and we plan to provide a clinical update on these studies in the second half of 2017. 

&#160; 

We further intend to initiate a translational medicine trial in late 2016 with serial patient tumor biopsies. General study objectives will be to develop deeper insights into the mechanism of action of MRX34 in melanoma patients, including pharmacodynamic biomarkers related to therapeutic activity and clinical response. 

&#160; 

Although we have observed a prolonged confirmed partial response and several prolonged stable diseases in 42 patients with HCC enrolled as of December 31, 2015, we do not plan to pursue HCC as monotherapy at this point in time. This decision was based on both encouraging responses observed in acral melanoma and RCC as well as the rapidly changing treatment paradigm, including the development of immune-oncology agents for HCC. 

&#160;

Combination Therapy for MRX34 

&#160; 

Use of combination therapy is common practice in the treatment of many different cancer types. Based on encouraging in vitro data, which demonstrate significant synergy between a mimic of miR-34 and either targeted therapies or standard chemotherapies. We have initiated a program to evaluate MRX34 in combination with various standard of care and investigational cancer drugs. In September 2015 we entered into a grant contract with CPRIT pursuant to which we agreed to conduct preclinical and clinical testing of certain combination therapies. We chose tumor models and chemotherapeutic agents based on the predicted patient profile in our future expanded clinical development program for MRX34. These included patients with primary liver cancer or advanced lung and pancreatic cancers that have metastasized to the liver. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The key insights developed from these introductory studies on the synergistic effects of drug combination form the basis for our ongoing and planned in vivo studies. We are testing the therapeutic benefit of combining MRX34 with erlotonib and the chemotoxic drug cisplatin in relevant mouse models of NSCLC. We expect that positive results from these preclinical studies, if any, may inform progression toward clinical testing. Given our recent preclinical data suggesting that MRX34 may also inhibit PD &#8209;L1 and tumor immune evasion, we also intend to explore the utility of miR &#8209;34 mimics in combination with other immuno &#8209;oncology therapies. 

&#160; 

Other Preclinical Product Candidates 

&#160; 

Through execution of our in silico , in vitro and in vivo analysis of multiple tumor suppressor microRNAs we have prioritized a pipeline of candidate molecules for further validation toward clinical candidate nomination. Each of these candidates is being studied for therapeutic potential in specific cancer indications to expand our oncology portfolio, as set forth in the table below:

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

&#160; 

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know &#8209;how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses, preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in &#8209;licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of microRNA therapeutics. Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio to protect and bolster our position as a leader in the field of microRNA therapeutics. 

&#160; 

Our Patent Portfolio 

&#160; 

We own or in &#8209;license a portfolio of patents and patent applications that protects various aspects of our business. The patents and patent applications that make up our patent portfolio are primarily focused on various aspects of microRNA therapeutics, including various microRNA mimics, such as our lead product candidate MRX34, and therapeutic methods of use of microRNAs, including MRX34. As of December 31, 2015, we own or in &#8209;license over 10 issued U.S. patents and over 42 pending U.S. and ex &#8209;U.S. patent applications. The expiration dates of the currently issued patents range from 2025 to 2032. We also have multiple pending patent applications that, if issued, will expire between 2025 and 2035. 

&#160; 

We are the sole owner of multiple U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to various aspects of microRNA therapies, including miR &#8209;34 therapies. Some of these patents and patent applications relate to chemically modified versions of miR &#8209;34 not currently used in MRX34 and other proprietary compounds that are possible candidates for future product development as microRNA therapeutics. For example, one of our owned patents (U.S. Patent No. 8,586,727) claims miR &#8209;34 mimics with certain nucleotide modifications. This patent is projected to expire in 2032. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We in &#8209;license a significant portion of our patent portfolio from our founding company, Asuragen, under a fully paid &#8209;up, royalty &#8209;free, fully sublicensable and irrevocable license granting us exclusive rights to these patents and patent applications in the field of therapeutics. Asuragen retains exclusive rights in these patents in fields outside therapeutics, including diagnostics. To date, the license from Asuragen has resulted in at least seven issued U.S. patents, and there are multiple applications pending within the United States and outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan. These patents include U.S. Patent 7,960,359, which is related to the use of miR &#8209;34a for reducing the cell viability of lung cancer cells, cancerous T cells, prostate cancer cells, or skin cancer cells and is projected to expire in 2025. They also include U.S. Patent 8,563,708, which claims multiple chemistries and structures used in therapeutic microRNA mimics and is projected to expire in 2025. The patents and patent applications licensed from Asuragen are also included within the patents licensed under our agreement with Yale, and are therefore subject to the terms of the February 2014 amended and restated agreement as described below in &#8220;Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations&#8212;Yale University.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We are the exclusive licensee under a patent family owned by the University of Zurich relating to treatment of certain types of B &#8209;cell lymphoma with certain microRNA mimics, including miR &#8209;34. The patent family includes one granted U.S. patent related to use of a miR &#8209;34 microRNA for the treatment of diffuse large B &#8209;cell lymphoma, one pending U.S. patent application and one pending European patent application. This patent and any patents that issue from the pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2031. 

&#160; 

We are a licensee under a patent family controlled by Rosetta Genomics covering certain therapeutic applications for microRNA 34a, such license being exclusive for MRX34. The licensed patents are jointly owned by YEDA Research and Development Company Ltd., the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Rosetta. The license includes both U.S. and European patents and patent applications, all of which are expected to expire in approximately 2028. 

&#160; 

We are also the exclusive licensee of two U.S. patents owned by Yale relating to uses of let &#8209;7 microRNAs. These patents are expected to expire in 2025. 

&#160; 

Patent Term 

&#160; 

The term of individual patents and patent applications in our portfolio will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, however, if a patent was in force on June 8, 1995, or issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, that patent will generally have a term that is the greater of twenty years from the filing date or 17 years from the date of issue. 

&#160; 

Under the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA &#8209;approved drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one &#8209;half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act permits the owner of a patent to apply for a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use, or to work with our licensors, as owners of such patents, to obtain such extensions, if available. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Strategic Partnerships and Licenses 

&#160; 

Asuragen, Inc. 

&#160; 

In 2009, we in &#8209;licensed or acquired certain patents and applications relating to certain aspects of microRNA compounds, targets for microRNAs and methods of use of such compounds from our founding company, Asuragen, and entered into a cross license with Asuragen, under which Asuragen granted us an exclusive, fully sublicensable, fully paid &#8209;up, royalty &#8209;free, perpetual and irrevocable license in the field of therapeutics, under patents and applications retained by it relating to microRNAs and their uses. Asuragen retains all rights in the fields outside therapeutics under the patents and applications that it retained and licensed to us, and we have granted to Asuragen an exclusive (even as to us), fully sublicensable, royalty &#8209;free, perpetual and irrevocable license in the field of diagnostics under the patents and applications relating to microRNA that we solely own as a result of the acquisition, while we retain all rights in therapeutics and all other fields outside diagnostics. Under our cross license agreement with Asuragen, as amended in 2012, we have the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of our owned patent families as well as certain patent families owned by Asuragen. Each party retains the right to enforce the patents that it owns against third parties, with the exception of certain foundational patents that are owned by Asuragen. Additionally, certain of these Asuragen patents are included within the patents licensed under our agreement with Yale, and are therefore subject to the terms of the February 2014 amended and restated agreement as described below in &#8220; Yale University .&#8221; 

&#160; 

Marina Biotech, Inc. 

&#160; 

In December 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Marina Biotech, Inc. (Marina), pursuant to which Marina granted us an exclusive license under its proprietary liposomal delivery technology, NOV340, known under the brand name &#8220;SMARTICLES,&#8221; to develop and commercialize drug products incorporating SMARTICLES in combination with our lead therapeutic product, MRX34, for the prevention and treatment of cancer and any other disease in humans and animals, with the exception of DNA interference human therapeutic use. Our license agreement with Marina has been amended twice. In December 2013, the license agreement was amended to modify certain payment obligations with respect to MRX34, and to include within the scope of our exclusive license three additional specific microRNAs selected by us, and in May 2015 we amended the license agreement to reduce the amount of a specific milestone payment and to provide for the prepayment of such milestone payment. In August 2015, we also entered into a side letter to the license agreement, under which we exercised our right to select an additional specific microRNA, in exchange for the payment of a specified selection fee payment. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products in specified major markets, and in other markets where we consider it is commercially reasonable to do so. We are responsible, at our cost, for all development of manufacturing processes and scale &#8209;up for the licensed technology in connection with our licensed products. 

&#160; 

We have paid Marina approximately $2.1 million in the aggregate to date in up &#8209;front and milestone payments and as consideration for the inclusion within the license of the four additional compounds. As we progress development and commercialization of products covered by the license, we will be required to make payments to Marina based upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, totaling up to $6 million in the aggregate for each licensed product. We are also required to pay up to an additional $4 million per licensed product upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones for a specified number of additional indications, leading to a maximum cap on all milestone payments of $10 million per product. The exception to this is for our lead therapeutic product, MRX34, where the aggregate of all remaining development and regulatory milestone payments due to Marina, including for all additional indications, is $4.0 million. In addition to milestone payments, we will be required to pay low single digit royalties on net sales of licensed products other than MRX34, subject to customary reductions and offsets. As a result of our 2013 amendment to our agreement with Marina, we are no longer required to pay a royalty to Marina with respect to sales of our lead therapeutic product, MRX34. For licensed products other than MRX34, our obligation to pay royalties to Marina will expire on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country and licensed product &#8209;by &#8209;licensed product basis upon the later of the expiration of all patents covering such licensed product in such country, or 10 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country. If we sublicense the rights granted to us under the Marina license for each optioned microRNA compound covered by such sublicense, we are required to pay a specific lump &#8209;sum payment representing the remainder of the selection fee for the inclusion of such microRNA compound within the scope of the license agreement, 

&#160;

as well as a portion of any revenue we receive from such sublicensees at a tiered percentage between the very low single digits and the mid &#8209;teens, depending on the circumstances in which the sublicense is entered into. 

&#160; 

We may terminate our agreement with Marina for any reason by giving 60 days&#8217; notice to Marina. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the insolvency of the other party or upon 90 days&#8217; notice to the other party for the uncured material breach of the agreement, with the exception of non &#8209;payment which permits Marina to terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#8217; notice to us. Absent earlier termination, our agreement with Marina will remain in force on a licensed product &#8209;by &#8209;licensed product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the earlier of the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties with respect to such licensed product in such country, or the end of the calendar quarter in which sales of a generic version of such licensed product exceed a specified proportion of the aggregate sales of such licensed product in such country. 

&#160; 

Yale University 

&#160; 

In 2006, Asuragen entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yale University (Yale) that granted to Asuragen an exclusive, worldwide, fully sublicenseable license for all human therapeutic and diagnostic uses under certain patent rights relating to microRNAs arising from the laboratory of Dr. Frank Slack at Yale. This agreement was assigned to us by Asuragen in connection with our acquisition of certain assets, including patent rights, in 2009. In addition, some of the patent filings in our intellectual property portfolio that are licensed to us by Asuragen are also included in the patents licensed under the Yale agreement as a result of previous discussions between the parties about possible co &#8209;ownership with Yale of these patents. The patents that are subject to both the Yale and Asuragen licenses cover certain aspects relating to the composition and method of use of specified microRNA mimics, including miR-34 and let &#8209;7, while those patent families that are solely subject to our license from Yale cover certain uses of let &#8209;7. In February 2014, we amended and restated our agreement with Yale to modify, among other things, the procedure for determining the inventorship of such patents and applications. Following this amendment, an independent third party expert was engaged to determine the inventorship, and hence the ownership, of the patents and applications potentially subject to Yale and Asuragen co &#8209;ownership. This determination confirmed each party&#8217;s sole ownership of each patent where co &#8209;ownership had been under consideration. Upon commercialization of any products covered by the licensed patents, our financial obligations to Yale, if any, will depend on the particular product and Yale&#8217;s ownership rights in any patents covering such product. 

&#160; 

We are required to use reasonable commercial efforts with respect to development and commercialization of products covered by our license agreement with Yale and to fulfill certain specified development and regulatory diligence criteria, or achieve specified development milestones by specified dates, in some cases subject to an extension upon payment of certain fees, for products covered by the agreement. 

&#160; 

We will be required to pay royalties to Yale on net sales of licensed products that contain specified microRNAs, including MRX34 and products containing let &#8209;7, at a percentage ranging from the very low to the low single digits, subject to customary reductions and offsets. Our obligation to pay royalties to Yale will expire on a licensed product &#8209;by &#8209;licensed product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the earlier of the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product or the launch of a generic version of such product in such country that has been approved by the applicable regulatory authority in such country. We will also be required to pay to Yale a portion of specified gross revenue that we receive from our sublicensees at percentages ranging from the mid &#8209;single digits up to the very low twenties, depending on the particular product and Yale&#8217;s ownership rights, if any, in the patents covering such product. 

&#160; 

We will also be required to make payments for achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones by products containing one specified microRNA and covered by the licensed patents of up to $600,000 in the aggregate for each such product, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. In addition, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee and minimum annual royalties under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

We have the right to terminate our agreement with Yale for any reason upon three months&#8217; written notice to Yale, and either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days&#8217; notice for the uncured material breach of the other party. Yale may terminate our agreement, on a licensed product miRNA category &#8209;by &#8209;licensed product miRNA category basis, 

&#160;

if we fail to meet specified diligence obligations within specified time periods, subject to our right to extend such periods with respect to one such product by making specified extension payments and to renegotiate such time periods under certain circumstances with respect to the other two products. Yale may also terminate our agreement in its entirety immediately upon notice to us if we fail to maintain adequate insurance or become insolvent. In the event that our license agreement with Yale is terminated, we would lose our rights under any licensed patents that are solely owned by Yale. Absent earlier termination, our agreement with Yale will remain in force on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patents, whether owned by us or by Yale. 

&#160; 

University of Zurich 

&#160; 

In March 2013, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, with the University of Zurich under certain patent rights relating to the treatment of certain types of B &#8209;cell lymphoma with microRNA mimics, in the fields of therapeutics and diagnostics. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee, and upon commercialization of any products covered by the licensed patent rights, we will be required to pay the University of Zurich a royalty on net sales of products covered by the licensed patents by us, our affiliates or sublicensees in the very low single digits, and a portion of other fees received from any sublicensees at a percentage in the mid &#8209;teens. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, sell and market licensed products. If we fail to comply with our diligence obligations, then under certain circumstances, the University of Zurich may terminate our agreement immediately upon notice to us. 

&#160; 

We have the right to terminate our agreement with the University of Zurich for any reason upon six months&#8217; prior notice. The University of Zurich may terminate our agreement immediately upon notice to us in certain circumstances if we fail to meet our diligence obligations. The University of Zurich may also terminate the agreement upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to us in the event of our uncured material breach of the agreement, or immediately upon notice to us in the event of our insolvency or if we challenge or assist any third party to challenge the validity of the licensed patents. 

&#160; 

Rosetta Genomics 

In December 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rosetta Genomics Ltd. (&#8220;Rosetta&#8221;), in-licensing certain patents controlled by Rosetta covering certain therapeutic applications for microRNA 34a. The licensed patents are jointly owned by YEDA Research and Development Company Ltd., the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Rosetta. The license grants to Mirna certain non-assignable, non-transferable, worldwide rights in connection with the development and commercialization of products that relate to the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-34 (Products), and is exclusive with respect to MRX34, the Company&#8217;s lead product candidate. 

The License Agreement included an up-front, non-refundable payment to Rosetta of $1.6 million. It also includes obligations to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales of Products as well as royalties on sublicense revenues. Certain development and regulatory milestone payments may also be payable in connection with certain Products that relate to the TP53 gene. 

The License Agreement ends on the date on which no patent applications comprised within the Licensed Patents are pending and all issued Licensed Patents have expired. We have the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon 120 days&#8217; written notice to Rosetta, subject to certain conditions, including payment of an early termination fee ranging from $2.0 million to $3.5 million. The License Agreement may also be terminated by Rosetta, with written notice, of the Company&#8217;s uncured material breach, insolvency, bankruptcy or general assignment for the benefit of the creditors. 

The License Agreement also includes customary provisions regarding, among other things, representations and warranties, recordkeeping, intellectual property, confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

CPRIT 

&#160; 

In August 2010, we entered into a grant contract with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), under which we received a $10.3 million commercialization award from the State of Texas through CPRIT. CPRIT was established to expedite innovation and commercialization in the area of cancer research and to enhance access to evidence &#8209;based prevention programs and services throughout the State of Texas. The award was a three &#8209;year award that was funded annually, and the contract terminated on January 31, 2014, subject to our obligations to make certain payments that survive termination. Under the terms of the award, we will be required to pay to CPRIT a portion of our revenues from sales of certain products by us, including sales of MRX34, or received from our licensees or sublicensees, at a percentage in the low single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals a specified multiple of the grant amount, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent, subject to our right, under certain circumstances, to make a one &#8209;time payment in a specified amount to CPRIT to buy out such payment obligations. We will also be required to repay CPRIT the total amount of the grant proceeds under certain circumstances of relocation of our principal place of business outside Texas during a specified period following the final payment of grant funding to us. 

&#160; 

On September 1, 2015, we entered into a new grant contract with CPRIT in connection with an approximately $16.8 million award, subject to extension by mutual agreement by us and CPRIT. In October 2015, concurrent with our IPO, we realized this 2015 award in the form of an agreement by CPRIT to purchase approximately $16.8 million of shares of our common stock in a private placement. In contrast to our 2010 award, this 2015 award does not include any royalty obligation upon commercialization of our product candidates, nor are we required to repay the grant proceeds under specified circumstances. Pursuant to this grant contract, we will conduct preclinical and clinical development of certain combination therapy approaches for lung or liver cancer involving our lead product candidate, MRX34. If, at any time during the term of the grant contract, we determine that the project provided for by the grant contract is no longer commercially feasible for us, then we and CPRIT are required to consult in order to reallocate the remaining unspent budget for the project to another oncology project in our product candidate pipeline. 

&#160; 

Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH 

&#160; 

In November 2012, we entered into a supply agreement with Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH (Polymun) for the formulation, manufacture and supply of a liposomal formulation of finished drug product for our lead product candidate, MRX34, utilizing the NOV340 SMARTICLES technology licensed to us by Marina in conjunction with Polymun&#8217;s proprietary technology relating to the production of liposomal formulations, for use by us in our clinical trials for MRX34. The agreement contains terms and conditions generally consistent with an agreement for manufacture and supply of a pharmaceutical product for clinical purposes, including with respect to supply of product in accordance with specifications and quality assurance and quality control activities. We have also entered into a separate quality agreement with Polymun governing all supply of product under the agreement. Under our agreement with Polymun, we retain all intellectual property rights arising as a result of the activities under the agreement, subject to certain limited exceptions relating to Polymun&#8217;s proprietary technology. The agreement remains in force until completion of the activities set forth under any statements of work executed under the agreement, unless earlier terminated by either party. Either we or Polymun may terminate the agreement on 30 days&#8217; written notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach or insolvency. 

&#160; 

MRX34 Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

Because each microRNA regulates a unique set of genes, we believe that the selection of microRNA &#8209;based therapies will be based upon the molecular characteristics of the tumors from the cancer patients. We believe that it is also likely that our microRNA &#8209;based therapies might be used in combination with one another to further maximize potency and drug development opportunities. Several indications of high unmet need currently included in our MRX34 development program are summarized below. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Skin Cancer (Melanoma) 

&#160; 

An aggressive type of skin cancer, melanoma, can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as chest and back in men, legs in women, as well as face, neck, hands and arms. Melanoma is a disease in which pigmented cells in the skin, called melanocytes, turn into cancer cells. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the incidence of melanoma skin cancers has been increasing over the past decades and has reached 132,000 globally each year. Approximately 73,000 cases of melanoma are expected to be diagnosed and 10,000 deaths will occur in the United States alone in 2015, according to the American Cancer Society. The five &#8209;year survival rate is currently about 15% to 20% in patients with metastatic melanoma. Approved treatment options for melanoma include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy and targeted therapies. In recent years, significant advances have been achieved in the treatment of melanoma by targeting PD &#8209;1, a protein expressed on the cellular surface of immune cells called T cells that normally function to keep these cells from attacking other cells in the body. The PD &#8209;1 signal is induced by PD &#8209;L1, which is expressed by a variety of normal cells. PD &#8209;L1 can also be expressed by various tumor cells, including melanoma, and consequently leads to tumor immune evasion. Drugs that block PD &#8209;1 boost the immune response against melanoma cells, which can often lead to tumor shrinkage and increased patient survival. Keytruda &#174; (Pembrolizumab) and Opdivo &#174; (Nivolumab) are FDA &#8209;approved drugs that target PD &#8209;1. Yervoy &#174; &#160; (I pilimumab) also boosts immune response but blocks CTLA &#8209;4, another T cell protein. Clinical trials have recently shown these drugs to be highly effective, but package inserts indicate that these drugs are effective against less than approximately 25% of patients. Recent preclinical data have shown that miR &#8209;34 also activates the immune system by repressing PD &#8209;L1. Our development plan includes continuing to study MRX34 as a monotherapy in melanoma and in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors to determine whether MRX34 may be able to increase the numbers of patients who respond to these therapies or minimize or reverse resistance and eventual disease progression. 

&#160; 

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) 

&#160; 

RCC is a type of kidney cancer that is asymptomatic in its initial stages, and as a result, is often at advanced stages of the disease by the time it is discovered. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults in the world, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases in adults. The WHO estimates approximately 347,000 cases of kidney cancer occurred in 2012 worldwide. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates approximately 62,700 new diagnoses of, and approximately 14,240 deaths from, kidney cancer in the United States in 2016, with a five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer of approximately 8%. The most commonly used treatments for kidney cancer are various forms of targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or immunotherapy. Opdivo &#174; (Nivolumab), an inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, was approved by the FDA in late 2015 for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The U.S. approval was based on data from CheckMate -025, an open-label, randomized Phase 3 study which demonstrated a median overall survival benefit of 25 months compared with 19.6 months for Afinitor &#174; (Everolimus) in patients with advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC. 

&#160; 

Primary Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma, or HCC) 

&#160; 

According to the WHO, liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. HCC is the most prevalent form of liver cancer and is the most common cancer in some parts of the world, with more than one million new cases diagnosed each year worldwide according to the National Cancer Institute. According to recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control, HCC rates in the United States are increasing with common risk factors including alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome, chronic hepatitis B or C infection and Type 2 diabetes. Patients diagnosed with HCC have a poor prognosis, with a very low five &#8209;year survival rate of less than 10%. Treatment options include surgical resection, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation and chemoembolization, or delivery of a drug mixed with particles through an arterial catheter directly into the tumor&#8217;s blood supply. The only systemic drug therapy approved for the treatment of unresectable HCC is Nexavar &#174; (Sarofenib), which provides a 2.8 months median overall survival benefit based on a median overall survival of 10.7 months compared to 7.9 months for a placebo. Opdivo &#174; (Nivolumab), a PD &#8209;1 (programmed death 1) blocker, has recently shown promising results in HCC with a 19% objective response rate reported in a Phase 1 clinical trial. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Lung Cancer 

&#160; 

According to the WHO, lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and it has retained this position for decades. There were an estimated 1.8 million new cases in 2012, 58% of which occurred in less developed regions of the world. Lung cancer is also the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly one in five (19.4% of the total). Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), also called oat cell cancer, accounts for about 10% &#8209;15% of lung cancers. SCLC is particularly aggressive and often spreads quickly. Five &#8209;year survival rates range from approximately 30% in patients with &#8220;limited stage&#8221; disease to approximately 2% for patients with &#8220;extensive stage.&#8221; Treatment options for people with SCLC include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Non &#8209;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancers. Types of NSCLC include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. The five &#8209;year survival rate for patients with NSCLC can be as high as 50% for patients diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. However, for patients with metastases, the five &#8209;year survival is typically less than 5%. Treatment options for NSCLC also include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. However, more recently approved targeted therapies and immunotherapies have become the standard of care. Targeted therapies include drugs that target tumor blood vessel growth (angiogenesis inhibitors), drugs that target growth factor receptors on the surface of tumor cells (e.g., EGFR inhibitors) and drugs that target certain genes which have been found to have mutations which produce proteins that cause cancers to grow and spread (e.g., ALK inhibitors). In March 2015, Opdivo &#174; (Nivolumab), a PD &#8209;1 blocker, was the first immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for lung cancer. The approval was based on a study demonstrating that patients with advanced squamous cell non &#8209;small cell lung cancer lived an average of 3.2 months longer than those who received chemotherapy, with approximately 15% of patients treated with Opdivo experiencing tumor shrinkage or complete disappearance. Our development plans include the study of MRX34 in combination with targeted therapies or immunotherapy agents in NSCLC. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We contract with third parties to manufacture our compounds for nonclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to do so in the future. We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution or testing. We have personnel with the technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and we assess such compliance regularly through performance monitoring as well as a formal audit program. 

&#160; 

We continue to take steps to reduce our costs by working to improve yield in the manufacturing of the microRNA mimic, the drug substance, the liposomal formulation and the drug product, and we have and will continue to manage our vendor and supplier costs and evaluate alternative manufacturers and suppliers for MRX34 and our other pipeline candidates. As we move further through clinical development towards commercialization of MRX34 and our other pipeline microRNA mimics, we will need to work with our third party manufacturers to scale up the manufacturing processes for such products, and we expect we will be able to realize additional efficiencies resulting from increased scale of production, which we believe will result in lower costs and better operating margins. 

&#160; 

Drug Substance 

&#160; 

We currently use NITTO DENKO Avecia (Avecia), to manufacture our MRX34 drug substance. We entered into a long term clinical supply agreement with Avecia in March 2012, and we believe that Avecia has the technical, analytical, quality and regulatory expertise to reliably produce our miR &#8209;34 mimic in sufficient quantity and of acceptable quality to support our development program through at least Phase 3 clinical studies, and to scale up such manufacturing process to support commercial production of MRX34. To ensure adequate supply and supply continuity, we are currently 

&#160;

evaluating a backup supplier for our MRX34 drug substance, which will be completed in the second half of 2015. We are evaluating other U.S. and overseas companies for the manufacture of drug substance for our pipeline microRNA mimics. 

&#160; 

The process for manufacturing our miR &#8209;34 mimic drug substance utilizes well &#8209;established solid phase synthesis chemistry. The raw materials used in the process are readily available from a number of qualified suppliers. We currently rely on our contract manufacturers to manage the supply chain for the raw materials used in the process. 

&#160; 

Drug Product 

&#160; 

Our drug product for both MRX34 and our other microRNA mimics consists of the drug substance formulated in the SMARTICLES liposomal delivery system. The drug product is provided as a concentrated, frozen aqueous solution that is defrosted, thawed and diluted for infusion in the clinic. 

&#160; 

Polymun, located in Vienna, Austria, is currently the exclusive manufacturer of drug product for our lead therapeutic candidate, MRX34. In November 2012, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Polymun for the formulation, manufacture and packaging of MRX34 final drug product. Manufacture of the drug product for our microRNA mimics in conjunction with the SMARTICLES delivery system requires a high level of technical expertise, and Polymun is one of a limited number of contract manufacturers with the know &#8209;how to manufacture drug product for our drug candidate in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality to meet our projected clinical and commercial needs. We believe that Polymun currently has the capability to provide a sufficient quantity of drug product through at least Phase 3 clinical studies of MRX34, and although Polymun does not currently have the capability to scale up their manufacturing process to support commercialization of MRX34, we believe that Polymun will have sufficiently expanded its operations before we reach potential commercialization of MRX34 such that it should be able to provide a sufficient quantity of drug product to support such commercialization of MRX34. In the meantime, we intend to continue to work with Polymun in relation to both our clinical supply and increasing production capacity for our projected commercial needs, but also to evaluate other potential manufacturers of drug product for our microRNA mimics. See &#8220;Business&#8212;Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations&#8221; for a detailed description of our manufacturing and supply agreement with Polymun, including material terms relating to circumstances permitting termination of this agreement. 

&#160; 

The liposomal formulation manufactured by Polymun is a combination of readily available excipients, plus two specialty lipid excipients which are currently manufactured by two qualified suppliers. 

&#160; 

The product is shipped and stored under frozen conditions. Based on current stability studies, we expect that the drug product will be stable over the time period anticipated for currently &#8209;planned clinical studies. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We are conducting clinical trials and other development activities to support the development of MRX34 and our other product candidates. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $18.9 million, $10.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of research and development expense. 

&#160; 

Our research programs are directed towards the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Determining if biomarkers can be used to select cancer patients who are more likely to respond to MRX34 therapy. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Selecting and developing a second miRNA &#8209;based therapeutic candidate for which we intend to begin clinical development in 2017. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Identifying drugs that can be combined with MRX34 to significantly improve the clinical response rates of cancer patients. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing a next &#8209;generation systemic delivery technology that will improve the tolerability and efficacy profiles of miRNA mimics and expand the cancer indications that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our intellectual property portfolio, scientific expertise and leading clinical position in the microRNA field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better &#8209;funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We may compete with other companies that are focused on microRNA therapeutics in disease or indications in which we develop our products, including both (i) replacement therapy approaches that involve the delivery of mimics, and (ii) inhibition approaches that involve the use of antagomiRs, or anti &#8209;miRs. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

&#160; 

We are aware of several companies that are working specifically to develop microRNA therapeutics. miRagen Therapeutics, Inc. (miRagen), a privately held company based in Boulder, Colorado, announced in November 2015 initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study of MRG-201, a synthetic microRNA mimic (promiR) to microRNA-29b. The Phase 1 trial is being conducted in normal healthy volunteers and may be extended to patients suffering from cutaneous scleroderma. In March 2016, miRagen announced the initiation of Phase 1 clinical study of its anti-cancer product candidate MRG-106, a synthetic microRNA antagonist (LNA antimiR &#174; ) of microRNA-155. The Phase 1 trial is being conducted in patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of the mycosis fungoides (MF) sub-type. &#160; miRagen also has preclinical anti &#8209;miRs programs with an initial focus in cardiovascular, metabolic diseases, and neurological diseases. miRagen has entered into a partnership with Laboratoires Servier to focus on three different targets in the cardiovascular and metabolic space. 

&#160; 

Regulus Therapeutics, Inc. (Regulus), is a publicly traded company based in Carlsbad, California, which primarily focuses on anti &#8209;miRs technology, or the inhibition of overexpressed microRNAs. Regulus has focused on a number of indications, including hepatitis C, kidney fibrosis and cancer. They announced completed enrollment in their first clinical trial for RG &#8209;101, their lead anti &#8209;miR therapeutic program, against miR &#8209;122 for hepatitis C in March 2014, and initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating RG &#8209;012 in healthy volunteers for the treatment of Alport syndrome in June 2015. In December 2015, Regulus announced initiation of a Phase I clinical study by its collaboration partner, AstraZeneca, of RG-125(AZD4076), an anti-miR-103/107 oligonucleotide for the treatment of NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes. &#160; Otherprograms are still in preclinical development. Regulus has numerous research and development collaborations with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including AstraZeneca plc, Biogen Idec, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Sanofi S.A. 

&#160; 

EnGeneIC is a privately held Australian company developing a nanocell platform for delivery of cancer therapeutics and other therapeutic molecules. In November 2014, EnGeneIC announced initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of its delivery system packaged with a miR &#8209;16 &#8209;based microRNA mimic for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. A patient case study from this study was recently published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine . 

&#160; 

These competitors also compete with us in recruiting human capital and securing licenses to complementary technologies or specific microRNAs that may be critical to the success of our business. They also compete with us for potential funding from the pharmaceutical industry. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, 

&#160;

labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post &#8209;approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other things, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, clinical holds, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical animal studies and formulation studies many of which must be performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Laboratory Practice, or cGLP, regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP), regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

&#160; 

The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 &#8209;day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, a submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the 

&#160;

clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy cGCP requirements, including the requirement to obtain effective informed consent from study subjects. 

&#160; 

All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life &#8209;threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications in patients with the disease or condition under study. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#8220;pivotal&#8221; studies, which typically denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically &#8209;dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

&#160; 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for 

&#160;

manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

&#160; 

New Drug Applications 

&#160; 

The results of nonclinical studies and of the clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 

&#160; 

Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within 10 months of the filing date for standard review, but this timeframe is also often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGCP requirements is satisfactory. 

&#160; 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts its inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time &#8209;consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may conditionally approve the NDA, among other things, requiring changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post &#8209;market studies or clinical trials. Such post &#8209;market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods after approval to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post &#8209;marketing programs. 

&#160; 

Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post &#8209;approval changes to an NDA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial 

&#160;

has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third &#8209;party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third &#8209;party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. 

&#160; 

The FDA closely regulates the post &#8209;approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct &#8209;to &#8209;consumer advertising, off &#8209;label promotion, industry &#8209;sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off &#8209;label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off &#8209;label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off &#8209;label use. 

&#160; 

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 

&#160; 

A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA&#8217;s review and approval of NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are potential eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. Based on results of clinical studies submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

&#160; 

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post &#8209;marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug&#8217;s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was 

&#160;

enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. We may consider seeking Breakthrough Therapy designation of MRX34 in the future. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user &#8209;fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven &#8209;year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven &#8209;year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. However, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. While we have not sought or obtained orphan drug designation for MRX34, we plan to seek such designation in the future for HCC, certain hematological malignancies or other potential future indications. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws 

&#160; 

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our drug candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti &#8209;kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti &#8209;kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under these laws, which could harm us. 

&#160; 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or 

&#160;

coding information to customers or promoting a product off &#8209;label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third &#8209;party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off &#8209;label promotion of drugs. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third &#8209;party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

&#160; 

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them, and, in some case, their distributors, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90 th day of each calendar year. 

&#160; 

There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to implement compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other health care providers. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

&#160; 

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160; 

Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we will have to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. 

&#160;

Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third &#8209;party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third &#8209;party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost &#8209;containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third &#8209;party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third &#8209;party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. 

&#160; 

Health Care Reform 

&#160; 

In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of Affordable Care Act of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An increase in the minimum rebates payable by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

A new rebate calculation for &#8220;line extensions&#8221; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An expansion of the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased &#8209;in by 2014. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An expansion of the types of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B drug pricing program, excluding orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

A requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., &#8220;donut hole&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Creation of a new Patient &#8209;Centered Outcomes Research to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted 

&#160;

by the Patient &#8209;Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

&#160; 

Many of the details regarding the implementation of Affordable Care Act are yet to be determined, and, at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that Affordable Care Act would have on our business. 

&#160; 

Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we, or our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of the drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

&#160; 

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one &#8220;reference member state,&#8221; or RMS, and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competing Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post &#8209;initial approval. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we, or our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end &#8209;of &#8209;life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits. 

&#160; 

Facilities and Services Agreement with Asuragen 

In October 2014, we amended an existing service agreement under which Asuragen provides certain services to us. These services include facilities &#8209;related services, warehouse services, shipping and receiving and other services. The term for the agreement expires in August 2016, but may be terminated earlier by either party with six months&#8217; notice. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 31 full &#8209;time employees, of whom two have medical degrees and four have Ph.D. degrees. Of these full &#8209;time employees, 24 employees are engaged in research and development activities and seven employees are engaged in business development, finance, human resources and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

About Us
