 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutic products for the treatment of ophthalmic disorders. We have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications protecting the use in the ophthalmic field of our current pipeline drug under development, a synthetic A3 adenosine receptor, or A3AR, agonist, CF101 (known generically as IB-MECA). CF101 is currently being developed by us to treat two ophthalmic indications: glaucoma and uveitis. We are currently conducting a Phase II trial with respect to the development of CF101 for the treatment of glaucoma or related syndromes of ocular hypertension. 

&#160; 

CF101 is a highly-selective, orally bioavailable small molecule synthetic drug, which targets the A3AR. We believe that CF101 has a favorable safety profile and a potent anti-inflammatory activity, mediated via its capability to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-undefined, MMPs, IL-1, and IL-6. This is mediated by activation of the A3AR, which is highly expressed in inflammatory tissues in contrast to normal tissues where expression levels of the receptor are very low. We believe that the anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective effects of CF101 make it a candidate for use in the treatment of ophthalmic indications. 

&#160; 

We are focused on the development of CF101 for the treatment of glaucoma, with a Phase II study ongoing in Israel and Europe. This study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of daily CF101 administered orally in subjects with elevated IOP. The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of oral CF101 in lowering IOP when administered BID for 16 weeks in subjects with elevated IOP. We have enrolled 44 subjects in the first segment of the study, randomized in a 3:1 ratio of CF101 1.0 mg treatment to the placebo. In 2015, we amended the ongoing Phase II study protocol and enrolled a further 44 subjects for the second segment, which was randomized in a 3:1 ratio of CF101 2.0 mg treatment to the placebo. This decision was based on certain positive data from the psoriasis Phase II/III study of CF101 by our majority stockholder and parent, Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd, or Can-Fite. As a result, there will not be an interim analysis and the full study data is expected to be announced in the second half of 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 

If successful, the treatment of glaucoma with an oral drug has the potential to be a breakthrough treatment in resolving patient compliance issues with current topical treatments. A third-party validation for the utilization of A3 adenosine receptor agonists for lowering intraocular pressure and treating glaucoma has been published by Professor M. Francesca Cordeiro, a Professor of Glaucoma &#38; Retinal Neuro-degeneration at the University College of London and Imperial College in London. 

&#160; 

According to Market Scope the global glaucoma pharmaceutical market is expected to be nearly $6.1 billion in 2020 and according to GlobalData the global uveitis therapeutics market is expected to grow from $0.3 billion in 2010 to $1.6 billion by 2017. None of our product candidates have been approved for sale or marketing and, to date, there have been no commercial sales of any of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Our corporate strategy is to build a specialized ophthalmic company that develops and in-licenses drugs for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. We intend to seek to obtain technologies that complement and expand our existing pipeline by entering into in-license or co-development agreements with academic institutions and biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We intend to commercialize our products through out-licensing arrangements with third parties who may perform any or all of the following tasks: completing development, securing regulatory approvals, manufacturing, marketing and sales. We do not intend to develop our own manufacturing facilities or sales forces. 

&#160; &#160; 

CF101 

&#160; 

CF101 is in development for the treatment of autoimmune-inflammatory diseases, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and the ophthalmic diseases, glaucoma and uveitis. In certain of our pharmacological studies, CF101 has also shown potential for development for the treatment of Crohn&#8217;s disease. While our majority stockholder and parent Can-Fite is developing CF101 for the treatment of autoimmune-inflammatory diseases, we have in-licensed from Can-Fite certain patents and patent applications for the development of CF101 for ophthalmic indications. In 2014, we decided to end the development of CF101 for the dry eye syndrome, or DES indication. This decision was based on a lack of correlation between patients' response to CF101 and over-expression of the drug target, the A3 adenosine receptor in this patient population. 

&#160; 

CF101 is a highly-selective, orally bioavailable small molecule synthetic drug, which targets the A3AR. Based on clinical studies to date undertaken by Can-Fite and us, we believe that CF101 has a favorable safety profile and significant anti-inflammatory effects as a result of its capability to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-undefined, IL-6 and IL-1, and chemokines, or small cytokines, such as MMPs, by signaling key proteins such as NF-&#1082;B and PKB/AKT. Overall, these up-stream events result in apoptosis of inflammatory cells. See Figure 1 below. CF101&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effect is mediated via the A3AR, which is highly expressed in inflammatory cells.

CF101 &#8211; Pre-Clinical and Clinical Profile 

&#160; 

Pre-Clinical Studies of CF101 

&#160; 

The information below is based on the various studies conducted with CF101, including preclinical studies. All of the studies were conducted by Can-Fite and/or by Can-Fite&#8217;s partners or affiliates. 

&#160; 

Pre-clinical studies are a set of experiments carried out in animals to show that a certain drug does not evoke toxicity. Based on the animal studies and safety data, one can approach the FDA and request permission to conduct a Phase I study in human beings. 

&#160; 

The toxicity of CF101 has been evaluated following 28-day, 90-day, six-month and nine-month good laboratory practice repeated-dose toxicity studies in male and female mice (28-day, 90-day and six-month), dogs (single-dose only), and monkeys (28-day, 90-day and nine-month). Even though the dose of CF101 in these studies was escalated to an exposure that is many folds higher than the dose used in human clinical studies, no toxic side effects were identified. 

&#160; 

Effects on cardiovascular parameters were evaluated in conscious instrumented monkeys and anesthetized dogs. These studies demonstrated no significant cardiovascular risk. 

&#160; 

Genotoxicity studies were conducted in bacterial and mammalian mutation assays in vitro &#160;(i.e., laboratory) and in an in vivo &#160;(i.e., animal) mouse micronucleus assay. These studies were all negative, indicating no deleterious action on cellular genetic material. 

&#160; 

Reproductive toxicology studies that we completed in mice and rabbits did not reveal evidence of negative effects on male or female fertility. In mouse teratology studies, or studies for abnormalities of physiological developments, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities were observed at doses greater than 10 mg/kg; however, no such effects were observed at 3 mg/kg demonstrating the safety of the drug in this concentration range. Teratogenicity, or any developmental anomaly in a fetus, was not observed in rabbits given doses (greater than 13 mg/kg) that induced severe maternal toxicity in such rabbits. 

&#160; 

Studies of P450 enzymes, or enzymes that participate in the metabolism of drugs, showed that CF101 caused no P450 enzyme inhibition, or increased drug activity, or induction, or reduced drug activity. Studies carried out with radiolabeled (C 14 ) CF101 in rats showed that the drug is excreted essentially unchanged. These studies also showed that the drug is widely distributed in all body parts, except the central nervous system. 

&#160; 

Clinical Studies of CF101 

&#160; 

The information below is based on the various studies conducted with CF101, including clinical studies in patients with autoimmune inflammatory and non-ophthalmic related diseases. All of the studies were conducted by Can-Fite and/or by Can-Fite&#8217;s partners or affiliates. 

&#160; 

Phase I Clinical Studies of CF101 

&#160; 

CF101 has been studied comprehensively in normal volunteer trials to assess safety, pharmacokinetic metabolism and food interaction. Two Phase I studies in 40 healthy volunteers, single dose and repeated dose, indicated that CF101 is rapidly absorbed (reaching a maximal concentration within one to two hours) with a half-life of eight to nine hours. Some mild adverse events (principally, increased heart rate) were observed at doses higher than single doses of 10.0 mg and twice-daily doses of 5.0 mg. Such increase in heart rate was not accompanied by any change in QT intervals. The drug showed linear kinetics, in that the concentration that results from the dose is proportional to the dose and the rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the concentration, and low inter-subject variability, meaning that the same dose of the drug does not produce large differences in pharmacological responses in different individuals. A fed-fast Phase I study (with and without food) demonstrated that food causes some attenuation in CF101 absorption; accordingly CF101 is administered to patients on an empty stomach. An additional Phase I study of the absorption, metabolism, excretion and mass balance of 4.0 mg (C 14 ) CF101 was conducted in six healthy male subjects and demonstrated that CF101 was generally well-tolerated in this group. 

&#160; 

Based on the findings from Phase I clinical studies, 4.0 mg BID, or twice daily, was selected as the upper limit for initial Phase II clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 5 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase II, Phase II/III and Phase III Clinical Studies of CF101 

&#160; 

CF101 has completed eight Phase II studies, one Phase II/III study and one Phase III study in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or DES, in approximately 1,129 patients for an aggregate exposure of approximately 350 patient years. These studies indicate that CF101 has a favorable safety profile at doses up to 4.0 mg BID for up to 32 weeks. In these II studies, we did not observe a dose-response relationship between CF101 and adverse events. Moreover, we did not observe any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, blood chemistry or hematology. CF101 given as a standalone therapy reached the primary endpoint in Phase II clinical studies in DES, as further detailed below. In addition to the ophthalmic indications, positive data were observed utilizing CF101 as a standalone drug in three Phase II clinical studies in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, a Phase III study of CF101 for DES and two Phase IIb studies in rheumatoid arthritis utilizing CF101 in combination with methotrexate failed to reach the primary endpoint and a Phase II/III study of CF101 for psoriasis did not meet its primary endpoint although positive data from further analysis of the Phase II/III study suggests CF101 as a potential systemic therapy for patients with moderate-severe psoriasis. Can-Fite continues to develop CF101 as a standalone therapy for auto-immune inflammatory indications including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, in parallel to our development of CF101 for ophthalmic indications. Safety data from these studies will be shared between Can-Fite and the Company. 

&#160; 

CF101 for the Treatment of Ophthalmic Indications 

&#160; 

We are currently developing CF101 for the treatment of glaucoma and uveitis. In 2014, we decided to end the development of CF101 for the DES indication. This decision was based on a lack of correlation between patients' response to CF101 and over-expression of the drug target, the A3 adenosine receptor in this patient population. Set forth below are general descriptions of the ophthalmic diseases with respect to which CF101 has underwent, is currently undergoing, or is in preparation for clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Glaucoma: Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the optic nerve is damaged. This optic nerve damage involves loss of retinal ganglion cells, or neurons located near the inner surface of the retina, in a characteristic pattern. There are many different subtypes of glaucoma, but they can all be considered to be a type of optic neuropathy. Raised intraocular pressure, or IOP, is the most important and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. However, some individuals may have high IOP for years and never develop optic nerve damage. This is known as ocular hypertension. Others may develop optic nerve damage at a relatively low IOP, and, thus, glaucoma. Untreated glaucoma can lead to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which over time can progress to blindness. 

&#160; 

Glaucoma can be roughly divided into two main categories, &#8220;open angle&#8221; and &#8220;closed angle&#8221; glaucoma. The angle refers to the area between the iris and cornea through which fluid must flow to exit the eye. The difficulty or inability of such fluid to exit the eye causes an acute increase of pressure and pain. Closed angle glaucoma can appear suddenly, is often painful and visual loss can progress quickly. However, the discomfort often leads patients to seek medical attention before permanent damage occurs. Open angle, chronic glaucoma tends to progress at a slower rate and patients may not notice they have lost vision until the disease has progressed significantly. 

&#160; 

Uveitis: Uveitis is inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, or the uvea, caused by an immune reaction. Uveitis can be associated with auto-immune inflammatory diseases and various eye infections. Uveitis is a common cause of blindness. The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis, which involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be associated with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye and is most common in young and middle-aged people. 

&#160; 

Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea, and involves primarily the choroid, a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Anterior uveitis affects the front part of the uvea, and involves primarily the iris and the cilliary body. This type of uveitis is called iridocyclitis. These conditions may develop as a result of a body-wide, or systemic, infection or an autoimmune disease. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area, or the pars plana, between the iris, or colored part of the eye, and the choroid. Pars planitis usually occurs in young men and is generally not associated with any other disease. However, some evidence suggests it may be linked to Crohn&#8217;s disease and, possibly, multiple sclerosis. 

&#160; 

CF101 for the Treatment of Glaucoma 

&#160; 

We believe that the statistically significant decrease in IOP in the Phase II trial for DES, although observed in subjects without ocular hypertension, is clinically significant and indicates that CF101 may also have potential as a glaucoma therapy, as the main goal of glaucoma therapy is to reduce IOP. This finding led to a patent application for the use of CF101 for lowering IOP. It is our belief that this result, together with the neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory effects that have been demonstrated in our studies and the studies of others, warrants rapid progression into clinical study in this indication. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 6 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A Phase II study in patients with glaucoma or related syndromes of ocular hypertension is currently ongoing in Israel and Europe. This study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of daily CF101 administered orally in subjects with elevated IOP. The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of oral CF101 in lowering IOP when administered BID for 16 weeks in subjects with elevated IOP. We have enrolled 44 subjects in the first segment of the study, randomized in a 3:1 ratio of CF101 1.0 mg treatment to the placebo. In 2015, we amended the ongoing Phase II study protocol and enrolled a further 44 subjects for the second segment, which was randomized in a 3:1 ratio of CF101 2.0 mg treatment to the placebo. This decision was based on certain positive data from the psoriasis Phase II/III study of CF101 by our majority stockholder and parent, Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd, or Can-Fite. As a result, there will not be an interim analysis and the full study data is expected to be announced in the second half of 2016. Neither we nor Can-Fite has filed an IND for this indication as CF101 for the treatment of glaucoma is not currently being clinically tested in the United States and there are no near-term plans to do so. 

&#160; 

CF101 for the Treatment of Uveitis 

&#160; 

Former pre-clinical pharmacology studies conducted by Can-Fite in collaboration with a worldwide leading laboratory in uveitis research at the National Eye Institute at the U.S National Institute of Health, or the NIH, under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, demonstrated that CF101 was effective in inhibiting the development of posterior uveitis in an experimental animal model. Additional preclinical studies conducted by the Company, showed that CF101 was effective in treating anterior uveitis in experimental animal models. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Figure 2: Inhibition of the development of posterior and anterior uveitis in experimental animal models 

&#160; 

The efficacy of CF101 in treating both anterior and posterior uveitis in experimental animal models supports further testing of CF101 for the treatment of patients with either anterior or posterior uveitis. Can-Fite, together with the NIH, have applied for a patent for the use of CF101 for the treatment of uveitis. Can-Fite has licensed its share of this intellectual property to us and together we are in discussions with the NIH to obtain an exclusive license on the NIH&#8217;s share of this intellectual property. We designed a protocol for a Phase II uveitis study in Europe and Israel to investigate the efficacy and safety of CF101 in 45 patients with active, sight-threatening, noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis, who will be treated with either CF101 or a placebo for a period of six months. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects whose vitreous haze score improves by two or more grades on the &#8220;Miami Scale&#8221; (Vitreous Haze: Miami Scale 2). We are currently reviewing our clinical development plans and intend to provide an update on the development for this indication at a later stage. Neither we nor Can-Fite has filed an IND for this indication as CF101 for the treatment of uveitis is not currently being clinically tested in the United States and there are no near-term plans to do so.

&#160;

&#160; 

CF101 for the Treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome 

&#160; 

Following positive results in a Phase II study, in December 2012, we initiated a Phase III DES trial, under an IND with the FDA which was conducted by the Company in the United States, Europe and Israel. DES is an eye disease caused by eye dryness, which, in turn, is caused by either decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation. The randomized, double-masked Phase III clinical trial enrolled 237 patients with moderate-to-severe DES who were randomized to receive two oral doses of CF101 (0.1 and 1.0 mg) and a placebo, for a period of 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was complete clearing of corneal staining. In December 2013, we announced the results of this Phase III study of CF101 for the treatment of DES. In the study, CF101 did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of complete clearing of corneal staining, nor the secondary efficacy endpoints. Nonetheless, CF101 was found to be well tolerated. In 2014 we decided to end the development of CF101 for the DES indication. This decision was based on a lack of correlation between patients' response to CF101 and over-expression of the drug target, the A3 adenosine receptor in this patient population. 

&#160; 

The License Agreement 

&#160; 

On November 21, 2011, we entered into the License Agreement with Eyefite, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Can-Fite according to which Can-Fite (i) granted to Eyefite a sole and exclusive worldwide license for the use of CF101, Can-Fite&#8217;s therapeutic drug candidate, solely in the field of ophthalmic diseases and (ii) assigned to Eyefite its rights, title and interest in and to any and all INDs, to CF101 in the ophthalmic field. The license granted to Eyefite allows Eyefite to sublicense its rights to CF101 to third parties, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Eyefite has sole responsibility for preparing and maintaining all regulatory documentation with respect to approvals of CF101 in the field of ophthalmic diseases and all approvals and related regulatory documentation shall be Eyefite&#8217;s sole and exclusive property. Under the License Agreement, Eyefite was required to assume responsibility for making payments to Can-Fite&#8217;s licensor, the NIH, pursuant to, and for the term of, a license agreement between Can-Fite and NIH for certain patent rights relating to CF101. In June 2015, Can-Fite&#8217;s license with NIH expired and as a result Eyefite is no longer obligated to make any payments to NIH in connection with Can-Fite&#8217;s now expired license with NIH (other than with respect to any accrued and unpaid payments to which NIH may be entitled to). Patent rights granted to Eyefite under the License Agreement by Can-Fite that are not NIH patents are free of any royalties and milestone payments. 

&#160; 

The License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last of the patents licensed thereunder unless earlier terminated by one or both of the parties in accordance with the License Agreement. Can-Fite may terminate the License Agreement upon customary bankruptcy and insolvency events of Eyefite and upon Eyefite&#8217;s material breach of the License Agreement, upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice. Eyefite may terminate the License Agreement upon three months&#8217; prior written notice for any reason and upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice for Can-Fite&#8217;s material breach of the License Agreement. 

&#160; 

All inventions resulting from the development and commercialization of CF101 under the License Agreement belong to Can-Fite, whether such were invented solely by Can-Fite, solely by Eyefite or by both of entities. However, the License Agreement also grants Eyefite an exclusive license to use any such inventions in the field of ophthalmic diseases around the world for no additional consideration. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Can-Fite has the sole right to make elections with respect to patent term extension of or supplemental protection certificates with respect to the licensed Can-Fite patents and the sole right to seek and maintain any data exclusivity periods available for CF101. Also pursuant to the License Agreement, Can-Fite has retained the right to prosecute and maintain the patents licensed to us. 

&#160; 

The Services Agreement 

&#160; 

On November 21, 2011, EyeFite and Can-Fite entered into a Services Agreement pursuant to which Can-Fite manages, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101. The Services Agreement will remain in force for an unlimited period of time unless earlier terminated as follows: (i) by either party upon six-months&#8217; prior written notice to the other party; or (ii) at any time for cause by either EyeFite (which includes a breach of trust by Can-Fite, Can-Fite&#8217;s material breach of the Services Agreement or customary bankruptcy and insolvency events on the part of Can-Fite) or Can-Fite (which includes EyeFite&#8217;s material breach of the Services Agreement or the License Agreement, or customary bankruptcy and insolvency events on the part of EyeFite). As consideration for Can-Fite&#8217;s services pursuant to the Services Agreement, EyeFite must pay to Can-Fite (i) a services fee (consisting of all expenses and costs incurred by Can-Fite plus 15%, except in relation to patent payments which shall be treated on a pass through basis) and, (ii) additional fees equal to 2.5% of any revenues received by us (or any affiliate of ours including, Eyefite) for rights to CF101 from third-party sublicensees including up-front payments, developmental or commercial milestones, royalties on net sales and any similar payments, but not including payments to support or reimburse us for research, development, manufacturing or commercial expenses or for equity. We are required to pay the additional fees to Can-Fite within 30 days of receipt by us.

&#160; 

In February 2013, Can-Fite issued us a formal letter, which has been updated periodically (most recently in August 2015), stating that Can-Fite agrees to defer payments owed to it under the Services Agreement (under which Can-Fite manages, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101) beginning on January 31, 2013 until the completion of fundraising by the Company sufficient to cover such deferred payments. As of December 31, 2015, the deferred payments to Can-Fite totaled approximately $3,690,000. In addition, in August 2015, Can-Fite issued a financial support letter pursuant to which it committed to cover any shortfall in our costs and expenses of the operations which are in excess of our available cash to finance our operations, including cash generated from any future sale of Can-Fite shares held by us. Both letters expire in October 2016 and any related balance bears interest at a rate of 3% per annum. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business and operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations or factors. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

We believe that the raw materials that we require to manufacture CF101 are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic industrial chemical supplies. We do not rely on a single or unique supplier for the current production of CF101. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The relevant manufacturers of our drug products for our current clinical trials are compliant with both current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on third parties to produce our drug products for clinical trials and commercialization. Can-Fite used the Chinese chemical manufacturer Chemspec International Limited, which produces APIs as well as other specialty chemicals, as the manufacturer of CF101. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that our drug candidates, if approved, can be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. We and our contract manufacturers are, and will be, subject to extensive governmental regulation in connection with the manufacture of any pharmaceutical products or medical devices. We and our contract manufacturers must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP and cGLP for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. 

&#160; 

Contract Research Organizations 

&#160; 

Currently through Can-Fite under the Services Agreement, we outsource certain clinical development activities to contract research organizations, or CROs. Our clinical CROs are subject to guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, which attempt to harmonize the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, regulations and guidelines. Also through Can-Fite under the Services Agreement, we create and implement the drug development plans and manage the CROs according to the specific requirements of the drug candidate under development. To the extent clinical research is conducted by Can-Fite or the CROs (or us in the future), compliance with certain federal regulations, including but not limited to 21 C.F.R. parts 50, 54, 56, 58 and 318, which pertain to, among other things, institutional review boards, informed consent, financial conflicts of interest by investigators, good laboratory practices and submitting IND applications, may be required. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

We do not currently have any marketing or sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the pharmaceutical business, which are equipped to market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing capabilities and distribution networks throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our therapeutic candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

Patents 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, Eyefite has a field-of-use exclusive license under a patent portfolio owned or in-licensed by Can-Fite, or the Licensed IP. The Licensed IP includes patent and patent applications owned by Can-Fite or in-licensed by Can-Fite from others covering the manufacture of CF101 and certain other A3AR agonists and the use of CF101 and such other A3AR agonists for the treatment of a variety of ophthalmic diseases, including DES, glaucoma and uveitis. The field of use of the exclusive license to Eyefite includes the use of CF101 in the field of ophthalmology, or the Field. Eyefite is not aware of any issued or pending patent applications that could or would restrict or inhibit its ability to operate. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; a family of patents and pending patent applications which pertain to the method for synthesizing CF101. Such patents were granted in China, India, Japan and Israel. These patents are set to expire in 2028. The patent applications are pending in the United States and the EPO (designating all EPC member states). Each patent application has a filing date of March 13, 2008 and a priority date of March 14, 2007. The patents that may be issued with respect to these pending applications would expire in 2028. &#160;

We believe that our licensed patents provide broad and comprehensive coverage for the use of CF101 for the treatment of certain ophthalmic disorders. However, as a result of the termination of the NIH license agreement between Can-Fite and the NIH in June 2015 due to patent expiration, we no longer hold rights to a family of composition of matter patents relating to CF101 that were licensed from NIH. Nevertheless, because CF101 may be a new chemical entity (&#8220;NCE&#8221;), following approval of an NDA, we, if we are the first applicant to obtain NDA approval, may be entitled to five years of data exclusivity in the United States with resp ect to such NCEs. Analogous data and market exclusivity provisions, of varying duration, may be available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions. We may also be entitled to the rights under Can-Fite&#8217;s pharmaceutical use issued patents with respect to CF101, which provide patent exclusivity within the ophthalmic field until the mid-2020s. While we believe that we may be able to protect our exclusivity in the ophthalmic field through such use patent portfolio and such period of exclusivity, the lack of composition of matter patent protection may diminish our ability to maintain a proprietary position for our intended uses of CF101. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will be the first applicant to obtain an FDA approval for any indication of CF101 and we cannot be certain that we will be entitled to NCE exclusivity. In addition, Can-Fite has discontinued the prosecution of a family of pending patent applications under joint ownership of Can-Fite and NIH pertaining to the use of A3AR agonists for the treatment of uveitis. Such diminution of our proprietary position could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, Can-Fite has contractually agreed to be responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of its intellectual property rights and our licensed rights. Can-Fite may also bring any action for infringement of its intellectual property rights which are licensed to us, to the extent that we do not bring any such action. However, the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, such as Can-Fite and ourselves, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Can-Fite&#8217;s ability to maintain and solidify its proprietary position for the technology licensed to us will depend on its success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. There is no certainty that any of Can-Fite&#8217;s pending patent applications or those pending patent applications that it licenses, including those licensed to us, will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents and those that may issue in the future, including those licensed to Can-Fite, may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit its ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products under the License Agreement. We cannot be certain that Can-Fite was the first to invent the inventions claimed in its owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by Can-Fite or us, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us, as a licensee thereunder, with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of such patent.

Trade Secrets 

&#160; 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, such agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or others. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and a highly risky, costly and lengthy research and development process. Adequate protection of intellectual property, successful product development, adequate funding and retention of skilled, experienced and professional personnel are among the many factors critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry. 

&#160; 

We believe that the characteristics of CF101, may position it well against the competition in the ophthalmic markets, where treatments, when available, often include frequent self-administered eye drops, which may be more difficult than taking pills and may result in less than the full dose of the drug actually entering the eye, have undesirable side effects and do not always treat the underlying cause of the disease. 

&#160; 

On the other hand, other drugs on the market, new drugs under development (including drugs that are in more advanced stages of development in comparison to our drug pipeline) and additional drugs that were originally intended for other purposes, but were found effective for purposes targeted by us, may all be competitive to the current drug candidates in our pipeline. In fact, some of these drugs are well established and accepted among patients and physicians in their respective markets, can be efficiently produced and marketed, and are relatively safe. Moreover, other companies of various sizes engage in activities similar to ours. Most, if not all, of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them. Competitors include companies with marketed products and/or an advanced research and development pipeline. The competitive landscape in the ophthalmic therapeutics field includes Novartis/Alcon, Allergan, Pfizer, Roche/Genentech, Merck (which acquired Inspire Pharmaceuticals), Santen (which acquired Novagali), Bausch &#38; Lomb (which acquired ISTA Pharmaceuticals and was acquired by Valeant), GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis (which acquired Fovea) Shire (which acquired SARcode) and more.

Glaucoma 

&#160; 

According to Datamonitor, as of 2010, 7 million people in the seven major markets suffered from glaucoma. Market Scope expects the global glaucoma pharmaceutical market to climb from about $4.7 billion in 2015 to nearly $6.1 billion in 2020 at a compounded annual rate of 5.1%. We expect that the number of people who suffer from glaucoma will increase as the population in each of the seven major markets ages. 

&#160; 

The main drugs used to treat glaucoma include Xalatan&#174;, Travatan&#174; and Cosopt&#174;. Xalatan&#174; is recommended by the European Glaucoma Society and American Academy of Ophthalmologists as the first choice for the treatment of glaucoma. According to a Pfizer annual report, Xalatan&#174;, which is marketed by Pfizer, is the leading drug used to treat glaucoma, and had global sales of approximately $0.6 billion in 2013 compared to $1.2 billion in 2011. Travatan&#174; was first launched in the United States in 2001 and then Europe and the certain other markets in 2002. According to Evaluate Pharma, Travatan&#174;, marketed by Alcon, experienced sales of approximately $600 million in 2010 and 2011. Travatan&#174; is administered once each day, which ophthalmologists cite as a significant advantage over other drugs used to treat glaucoma. Cosopt&#174; is the oldest combination therapy in the glaucoma market. Due to the expiration of patents covering Cosopt&#174; in 2008, some ophthalmologists have begun to look to other brands or generic drugs in the treatment of glaucoma. Another leading company in this field is Allergan, which markets Lumigan&#174;, Ganfort&#8482;, Alphagan&#174;, and Combigan&#174;, with over $1.0 billion in aggregate revenues in 2011. The glaucoma therapeutics market has witnessed major revenues depletion in the recent years due to a string of patent expirations, which started with the expiration of the Xalatan&#174; patent. 

&#160; 

Several therapies are in advanced clinical development for glaucoma. In addition, in 2012, the FDA approved tafluprost ophthalmic solution, Zioptan by Merck, the first preservative-free prostaglandin analog ophthalmic solution, or a solution derived from fatty acids, for the treatment of glaucoma. 

&#160; 

While several anti-glaucoma drugs exist, the glaucoma therapeutics market has a high level of unmet need, which mainly arises from the lack of approved drugs targeting the disease&#8217;s progression. Many therapies approved provide only symptomatic relief. The therapies which are available for the treatment of glaucoma have shown low to moderate efficacy and safety profiles. Accordingly, there is a significant need for drugs that reduce IOP. In addition, part of the pathogenesis of glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve, so drugs that, in addition to lowering IOP, have a neuroprotective effect, would also satisfy an unmet need. Based on its toxicological profile, we believe that CF101 has the potential to have fewer side effects than existing drugs for the treatment of glaucoma. At the same time, CF101 offers the potential to act as a neuroprotective agent that prevents the death of retinal cells, as well as the potential to lower IOP. We also believe that CF101 will offer less frequent administration than most existing therapies. 

&#160; 

Uveitis 

&#160; 

According to Data Monitor, uveitis is estimated as the fifth or sixth leading cause of blindness in the United States. The incidence of uveitis worldwide varies from 14 to 52.4 per 100,000 people, while the overall prevalence around the world is reported as 0.73%. We estimate that there are approximately one million uveitis patients around the world. According to GlobalData, in 2010, the uveitis market was $0.32 billion and is estimated to reach $1.6 billion by 2017. The current treatments for uveitis include corticosteroids, anti-metabolites, T-cell inhibitors, alkylating agents and biological drugs, which often involve serious adverse side effects and lack of efficacy. Accordingly, we believe that a need exists for drugs used in the treatment of uveitis that are less toxic and more effective. There are currently several therapies in advance clinical development for anterior and posterior uveitis. 

&#160; 

We believe that a need exists for drugs used for the treatment of uveitis that are less toxic and more effective than currently available therapies. Former pre-clinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that CF101 is effective in inhibiting the development of posterior and anterior uveitis and has a favorable safety profile in experimental animal models. We submitted a protocol for a Phase II study of uveitis. We are currently reviewing our clinical development plans and will provide an update at the development for this indication at a later stage. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance for directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability with a coverage limit of $10.0 million in the aggregate for any and all losses arising out of any and all claims against our directors and officers, except for certain wrongful acts and certain claims arising out of securities offerings. 

&#160; 

Our majority stockholder and parent, Can-Fite, which conducts our current clinical studies pursuant to the Services Agreement, maintains worldwide product and clinical trial liability insurance with a coverage limit of approximately $3.0 million with respect to the use of CF101 in clinical trials, including for indications other than ophthalmic diseases. Can-Fite also procures additional insurance coverage for each specific clinical trial it conducts, which includes coverage for a certain number of trial participants and varies based on the particular clinical trial. Certain of such policies are based on compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, which is a set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation developed for the medical community by the World Medical Association and certain protocols from various health authorities throughout the world, some of which may be costly to comply with. 

&#160;

&#160; - 12 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe that our insurance policies are adequate and customary for a business of our kind. However, because of the nature of our business, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain insurance on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, or that any future claims will not exceed our insurance coverage. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We and our agents, including Can-Fite pursuant to the Services Agreement, are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We believe that our business, operations and facilities, including those of our agents and service providers, such as Can-Fite, are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Can-Fite&#8217;s laboratory personnel in Israel have ongoing communication with the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection in order to verify compliance with relevant instructions and regulations. In addition, all laboratory personnel participate in instruction on the proper handling of chemicals, including hazardous substances before commencing employment, and during the course of their employment. In addition, all information with respect to any chemical substance is filed and stored as a Material Safety Data Sheet, as required by applicable environmental regulations. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on us. The operation of testing facilities, however, entails risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future if these facilities are required to comply with new or more stringent environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or requirements. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $812,000 compared to approximately $721,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly controlled regulatory environment. Stringent regulations establish requirements relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of pharmaceuticals. Regulations also cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval. In many markets, especially in Europe, marketing and pricing strategies are subject to national legislation or administrative practices that include requirements to demonstrate not only the quality, safety and efficacy of a new product, but also its cost-effectiveness relating to other treatment options. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical products have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, preclinical studies and clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other product candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, as a result of these failures, we may also be unable to obtain additional financing. 

&#160; 

Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new pharmaceutical product be approved or exempted from approval before it is marketed, and have established high standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some products are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 13 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A summary of the U.S., EU and Israeli regulatory processes follow below.

&#160;

United States 

&#160; 

In the United States, the Public Health Services Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the safety and effectiveness standards for our products and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products on a product-by-product basis. 

&#160; 

Preclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical testing program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent. In Phase I, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of our product candidates. In Phase III, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the Institutional Review Board responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) is deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the candidate product for its intended use, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA an NDA seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We have not completed clinical trials for any candidate product for any intended use and therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filings. 

&#160; 

The purpose of an NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether it ought to approve the candidate product for marketing for specific intended uses. The NDA normally contains, among other things, sections describing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, microbiology, the results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate product. 

&#160; 

We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials (i.e., Phase IV trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product&#8217;s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 14 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving FDA approval, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to cGMP regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations. 

&#160; 

We have currently received no approvals to market our products from the FDA or other foreign regulators. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws pertaining to health care &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-kickback law, which governs federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), makes it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Many states have similar laws that are not restricted to federal healthcare programs. Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursement, including claims for the sale of drugs or services, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. If the government or a whistleblower were to allege that we violated these laws there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A finding of liability under these laws can have significant adverse financial implications for us and can result in payment of large penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given their broad reach and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we cannot assure you that some of our activities will not be challenged or deemed to violate some of these laws. 

&#160; 

European Economic Area 

&#160; 

Although we are not currently seeking regulatory approval in the EU, we may do so in the future. As such, a summary of the EU regulatory processes follows below. 

&#160; 

A medicinal product may only be placed on the market in the European Economic Area, or EEA, composed of the 27 EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, when a marketing authorization has been issued by the competent authority of a member state pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC (as recently amended by Directive 2004/27/EC), or an authorization has been granted under the centralized procedure in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 or its predecessor, Regulation 2309/93. There are essentially three community procedures created under prevailing European pharmaceutical legislation that, if successfully completed, allow an applicant to place a medicinal product on the market in the EEA. 

&#160; 

Centralized Procedure 

&#160; 

Regulation 726/2004/EC now governs the centralized procedure when a marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, acting in its capacity as the European Licensing Authority on the advice of the EMA. That authorization is valid throughout the entire community and directly or (as to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) indirectly allows the applicant to place the product on the market in all member states of the EEA. The EMA is the administrative body responsible for coordinating the existing scientific resources available in the member states for evaluation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. Certain medicinal products, as described in the Annex to Regulation 726/2004, must be authorized centrally. These are products that are developed by means of a biotechnological process in accordance with Paragraph 1 to the Annex to the Regulation. Medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes must also be authorized centrally. Starting on May 20, 2008, the mandatory centralized procedure was extended to autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. Finally, all medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 must be authorized under the centralized procedure. An applicant may also opt for assessment through the centralized procedure if it can show that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization centrally is in the interests of patients at the community level. For each application submitted to the EMA for scientific assessment, the EMA is required to ensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is given within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. This 210 days period does not include the time that the applicant to answer any questions raised during the application procedure, the so-called &#8216;clock stop&#8217; period. If the opinion is positive, the EMA is required to send the opinion to the European Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft decision granting a marketing authorization. This draft decision may differ from the CHMP opinion, stating reasons for diverging for the CHMP opinion. The draft decision is sent to the applicant and the member states, after which the European Commission takes a final decision. If the initial opinion of the CHMP is negative, the applicant is afforded an opportunity to seek a re-examination of the opinion. The CHMP is required to re-examine its opinion within 60 days following receipt of the request by the applicant. All CHMP refusals and the reasons for refusal are made public on the EMA website. Without a centralized marketing authorization it is prohibited to place a medicinal product that must be authorized centrally on the market in the EU. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 15 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures 

&#160; 

With the exception of products that are authorized centrally, the competent authorities of the member states are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for medicinal products placed on their national markets. If the applicant for a marketing authorization intends to market the same medicinal product in more than one member state, the applicant may seek an authorization progressively in the community under the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure. Mutual recognition is used if the medicinal product has already been authorized in a member state. In this case, the holder of this marketing authorization requests the member state where the authorization has been granted to act as reference member state by preparing an updated assessment report that is then used to facilitate mutual recognition of the existing authorization in the other member states in which approval is sought (the so-called concerned member state(s)). The reference member state must prepare an updated assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. This report together with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC (which sets out the conditions of use of the product), and a labeling and package leaflet are sent to the concerned member states for their consideration. The concerned member states are required to approve the assessment report, the SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet within 90 days of receipt of these documents. The total procedural time is 180 days. 

&#160; 

The decentralized procedure is used in cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorization in the EU at the time of application. The applicant requests a member state of its choice to act as reference member state to prepare an assessment report that is then used to facilitate agreement with the concerned member states and the grant of a national marketing authorization in all of these member states. In this procedure, the reference member state must prepare, for consideration by the concerned member states, the draft assessment report, a draft SmPC and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. As in the case of mutual recognition, the concerned member states are required to approve these documents within 90 days of their receipt. 

&#160; 

For both mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, if a concerned member state objects to the grant of a marketing authorization on the grounds of a potential serious risk to public health, it may raise a reasoned objection with the reference member state. The points of disagreement are in the first instance referred to the Co-ordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures, or CMD, to reach an agreement within 60 days of the communication of the points of disagreement. If member states fail to reach an agreement, then the matter is referred to the EMA and CHMP for arbitration. The CHMP is required to deliver a reasoned opinion within 60 days of the date on which the matter is referred. The scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP forms the basis for a binding European Commission decision. 

&#160; 

Irrespective of whether the medicinal product is assessed centrally, de-centrally or through a process of mutual recognition, the medicinal product must be manufactured in accordance with the principles of good manufacturing practice as set out in Directive 2003/94/EC and Volume 4 of the rules governing medicinal products in the European community. Moreover, community law requires the clinical results in support of clinical safety and efficacy based upon clinical trials conducted in the European community to be in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC, which implements good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. Clinical trials conducted outside the European community and used to support applications for marketing within the EU must have been conducted in a way consistent with the principles set out in Directive 2001/20/EC. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU requires, pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC, authorization by the relevant national competent authority where a trial takes place, and an ethics committee to have issued a favorable opinion in relation to the arrangements for the trial. It also requires that the sponsor of the trial, or a person authorized to act on his behalf in relation to the trial, be established in the community. 

&#160; 

National Procedure 

&#160; 

This procedure is available for medicinal products that do not fall within the scope of mandatory centralized authorization and are intended for use in only one EU member state. Specific procedures and timelines differ between member states, but the duration of the procedure is generally 210 days and based on a risk/efficacy assessment by the competent authority of the member state concerned, followed by determination of SmPC, package leaflet and label text/layout and subsequently grant of the marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations granted on this basis are not mutually recognized by other member states. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 16 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

There are various types of applications for marketing authorizations: 

&#160; 

Full Applications . A full application is one that is made under any of the community procedures described above and &#8220;stands alone&#8221; in the sense that it contains all of the particulars and information required by Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83 (as amended) to allow the competent authority to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the product and in particular the balance between benefit and risk. Article 8(3)(l) in particular refers to the need to present the results of the applicant&#8217;s research on (i) pharmaceutical (physical-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, (ii) preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) studies and (iii) clinical trials in humans. The nature of these tests, studies and trials is explained in more detail in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. Full applications would be required for products containing new active substances not previously approved by the competent authority, but may also be made for other products. 

&#160; 

Abridged Applications . Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC contains exemptions from the requirement that the applicant provide the results of its own preclinical and clinical research. There are three regulatory routes for an applicant to seek an exemption from providing such results, namely (i) cross-referral to an innovator&#8217;s results without consent of the innovator, (ii) well established use according to published literature and (iii) consent to refer to an existing dossier of research results filed by a previous applicant. 

&#160; 

Cross-referral to Innovator&#8217;s Data 

&#160; 

Articles 10(1) and 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC provide the legal basis for an applicant to seek a marketing authorization on the basis that its product is a generic medicinal product (a copy) of a reference medicinal product that has already been authorized, in accordance with community provisions. A reference product is, in principle, an original product granted an authorization on the basis of a full dossier of particulars and information. This is the main exemption used by generic manufacturers for obtaining a marketing authorization for a copy product. The generic applicant is not required to provide the results of preclinical studies and of clinical trials if its product meets the definition of a generic medicinal product and the applicable regulatory results protection period for the results submitted by the innovator has expired. A generic medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance as the reference medicinal product; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; having the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Applications in respect of a generic medicinal product cannot be made before the expiry of the protection period. Where the reference product was granted a national marketing authorization pursuant to an application made before October 30, 2005, the protection period is either six years or 10 years, depending upon the election of the particular member state concerned. Where the reference product was granted a marketing authorization centrally, pursuant to an application made before November 20, 2005, the protection period is 10 years. For applications made after these dates, Regulation 726/2004 and amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC provide for a harmonized protection period regardless of the approval route utilized. The harmonized protection period is in total 10 years, including eight years of research data protection and two years of marketing protection. The effect is that the originator&#8217;s results can be the subject of a cross-referral application after eight years, but any resulting authorization cannot be exploited for a further two years. The rationale of this procedure is not that the competent authority does not have before it relevant tests and trials upon which to assess the efficacy and safety of the generic product, but that the relevant particulars can, if the research data protection period has expired, be found on the originator&#8217;s file and used for assessment of the generic medicinal product. The 10-year protection period can be extended to 11 years where, in the first eight years post-authorization, the holder of the authorization obtains approval for a new indication assessed as offering a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing products. &#160; 

If the copy product does not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product or if certain types of changes occur in the active substance(s) or in the therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration in relation to the reference medicinal product, Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC provides that the results of the appropriate preclinical studies or clinical trials must be provided by the applicant. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Well-established Medicinal Use 

&#160; 

Under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a product have a well-established medicinal use within the community with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate that the constituent or constituents of the product have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However, use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance as a medicinal product in the EU. Even after 10 years&#8217; systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider among other factors the period over which a substance has been used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason, different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years. If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use compared with that to which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results would have to be provided. 

&#160; 

Informed Consent 

&#160; 

Under Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the grant of a marketing authorization the holder of such authorization may consent to a competent authority utilizing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation that it submitted to obtain approval for a medicinal product to assess a subsequent application relating to a medicinal product possessing the same qualitative and quantitative composition with respect to the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form. 

&#160; 

Law Relating to Pediatric Research 

&#160; 

Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 (as amended by Regulation (EC) 1902/2006) was adopted on December 12, 2006. This Regulation governs the development of medicinal products for human use in order to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the pediatric population. It requires any application for marketing authorization made after July 26, 2008 in respect of a product not authorized in the European Community on January 26, 2007 (the time the Regulation entered into force), to include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, unless the product is subject to an agreed waiver or deferral or unless the product is excluded from the scope of Regulation 1902/2006 (generics, hybrid medicinal products, biosimilars, homeopathic and traditional (herbal) medicinal products and medicinal products containing one or more active substances of well-established medicinal use). Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances where pediatric studies are not required or desirable. Deferrals can be granted in certain circumstances where the initiation or completion of pediatric studies should be deferred until appropriate studies in adults have been performed. Moreover, this regulation imposes the same obligation from January 26, 2009 on an applicant seeking approval of a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a product already authorized and still protected by a supplementary protection certificate granted under Regulation EC 469/2009 and its precursor (EEC) 1768/92 or by a patent that qualifies for the granting of such a supplementary protection certificate. The pediatric Regulation 1901/2006 also provides, subject to certain conditions, a reward for performing such pediatric studies, regardless of whether the pediatric results provided resulted in the grant of a pediatric indication. This reward comes in the form of an extension of six months to the supplementary protection certificate granted in respect of the product, unless the product is subject to orphan drug designation, in which case the 10-year market exclusivity period for such orphan products is extended to 12 years. If any of the non-centralized procedures for marketing authorization have been used, the six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is only granted if the medicinal product is authorized in all member states. 

&#160; 

Post-authorization Obligations 

&#160; 

In the pre-authorization phase the applicant must provide a detailed pharmacovigilance plan that it intends to implement post-authorization. An authorization to market a medicinal product in the EU carries with it an obligation to comply with many post-authorization organizational and behavioral regulations relating to the marketing and other activities of authorization holders. These include requirements relating to post-authorization efficacy studies, post-authorization safety studies, adverse event reporting and other pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising, packaging and labeling, patient package leaflets, distribution and wholesale dealing. The regulations frequently operate within a criminal law framework and failure to comply with the requirements may not only affect the authorization, but also can lead to financial and other sanctions levied on the company in question and responsible officers. 

&#160; 

As a result of the currently on-going overhaul of EU pharmacovigilance legislation the financial and organizational burden on market authorization holders will increase significantly, such as the obligation to maintain a pharmacovigilance system master file that applies to all holders of marketing authorizations granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Marketing authorization holders must furthermore collect data on adverse events associated with use of the authorized product outside the scope of the authorization. Pharmacovigilance for biological products and medicines with a new active substance will be strengthened by subjecting their authorization to additional monitoring activities. The EU is currently in the process of issuing implementing regulations for the new pharmacovigilance framework. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Any authorization granted by member state authorities, which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorized product in the authorizing member state ceases to be valid. When an authorized product previously placed on the market in the authorizing member state is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorization for that product shall cease to be valid. The same two three year periods apply to authorizations granted by the European Commission based on the centralized procedure. 

&#160; 

Israel 

&#160; 

In November 2011, Eyefite and Can-Fite entered into the Services Agreement, pursuant to which Can-Fite will manage, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101. As such, in addition to regulations of other countries where we are seeking regulatory approval, Israeli government regulation will also govern the development of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Israel Ministry of the Environment &#8212; Toxin Permit 

&#160; 

In accordance with the Israeli Dangerous Substance Law &#8212; 1993, the Ministry of the Environment may grant a permit in order to use toxic materials. Because Can-Fite utilizes toxic materials in the course of operation of their laboratories relating, in part, to our products, they were required to apply for a permit to use these materials. The current toxin permit held by Can-Fite will remain in effect until January 2017. 

&#160; 

Other Licenses and Approvals 

&#160; 

Can-Fite has a business license from the municipality of Petah-Tikva for a drug development research laboratory located at its offices in Petah Tikva, Israel. In order to obtain this license, Can-Fite also received approval from the Petah-Tikva Association of Towns Fire Department. Can-Fite&#8217;s business license is valid until December 2017. Can-Fite also has a radioactive materials or products containing radioactive materials license, which is valid until July, 2017. 

&#160; 

In 2002, Can-Fite received approval from the National Council on Animal Experiments, approving it as an institution authorized to conduct experiments on animals. 

&#160; 

Clinical Testing in Israel 

&#160; 

In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations also require authorization from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and similar trials, an additional authorization of the overseeing institutional ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since we intend to perform a portion of the clinical studies on certain of our therapeutic candidates in Israel, we will be required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health. 

&#160; 

Israel Ministry of Health 

&#160; 

Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Health, which regulates medical testing, has adopted protocols that correspond, generally, to those of the FDA and the EMA, making it comparatively straightforward for studies conducted in Israel to satisfy FDA and the EMA requirements, thereby enabling medical technologies subjected to clinical trials in Israel to reach U.S. and EU commercial markets in an expedited fashion. Many members of Israel&#8217;s medical community have earned international prestige in their chosen fields of expertise and routinely collaborate, teach and lecture at leading medical centers throughout the world. Israel also has free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Countries 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, the EU and Israel, we are subject to a variety of other regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of drugs in other countries. Whether or not our products receive approval from the FDA or EMA approval of such products must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries other than the United States or European Union before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing vary greatly from country to country. 

&#160; 

The requirements that we and our collaborators must satisfy to obtain regulatory approval by government agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of our products in such countries can be rigorous, costly and uncertain. In the European countries, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the European countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all European Union countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval. Foreign governments also have stringent post-approval requirements including those relating to manufacture, labeling, reporting, record keeping and marketing. Failure to substantially comply with these on-going requirements could lead to government action against the product, us and/or its representatives. 

&#160; 

Related Matters 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in governmental bodies that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA or EMA and other applicable regulatory bodies to which we are subject. In addition, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the national agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our therapeutic candidates. It is impossible to predict whether such legislative changes will be enacted, whether FDA or EMA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. We may need to adapt our business and therapeutic candidates and products to changes that occur in the future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had no full time or part-time employees. 

&#160; 

Historical Background 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 10, 1999, under the name Bridge Capital.com, Inc. Bridge Capital.com, Inc. was a nominally capitalized corporation that did not commence its operations until it changed its name to Denali Concrete Management, Inc., or Denali, in March 2001. Denali was a concrete placement company specializing in providing concrete improvements in the road construction industry and operated primarily in Anchorage, Alaska, placing curb and gutter, sidewalks and retaining walls for state, municipal and military projects. In December 2005, we ceased our principal business operations and focused our efforts on seeking a business opportunity. 

&#160; 

We consummated our reverse acquisition, or the Transaction, of all the outstanding interests in Eyefite Ltd., a private company incorporated on June 27, 2011 under the laws of the State of Israel, or Eyefite, pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated November 21, 2011, or the Acquisition Agreement, by and between the Company and Can-Fite. The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition wherein Can-Fite was treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. In connection with the completion of the Transaction on November 21, 2011, the following events occurred: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We entered into and completed a stock purchase agreement dated November 21, 2011,or the Stock Purchase Agreement, with Can-Fite, whereby Can-Fite purchased 8,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Eyefite. As a result of the consummation of the actions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, Eyefite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and Can-Fite became our majority stockholder and a parent. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Eyefite and Can-Fite entered into a License Agreement dated November 21, 2011, or the License Agreement, pursuant to which Can-Fite granted to Eyefite a sole and exclusive worldwide license for the use of CF101, Can-Fite&#8217;s therapeutic drug candidate, or CF101, solely in the field of ophthalmic indications. See the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221; below. &#160; 

&#160; - 20 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Eyefite and Can-Fite entered into a services agreement dated November 21, 2011, or the Services Agreement, pursuant to which Can-Fite manages, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We issued a warrant, or the Warrant, to Can-Fite by which Can-Fite has the right, until the earlier of (a) the November 21, 2016 and (b) the closing of the acquisition of us by another entity, resulting in the exchange of our outstanding common shares such that our stockholders prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity, to convert its right to the additional fee under the Services Agreement into 480,022 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The per share exercise price for the shares is $5.148. This Warrant may be exercised on either a cash or a cashless basis, provided that if the Warrant is exercised on a cashless basis, the Warrant must be exercised in whole, not in part. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; On November 21, 2011, we completed a private placement of shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $3.3 million through the sale of 646,776 shares to third party investors and sold 466,139 shares of our common stock to Can-Fite in exchange for 714,922 ordinary shares of Can-Fite, valued at $2.4 million (as determined by reference to the previous trading day&#8217;s closing price for Can-Fite shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange), and 97,112 shares to Can-Fite for gross proceeds of $500,000 (collectively, together with the shares issued to the investors, the &#8220;Financing&#8221;). In addition, we issued to Can-Fite and each of the other investors, for each four shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock purchased in the Financing, nine warrants valid for a period of five years from the closing of the Financing to acquire two shares of the Company for an exercise price of $7.74. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; On November 21, 2011, we repurchased 1,722,222 outstanding shares of our common stock from Mathew G. Rule, our sole officer and director at the time, for $7,750, or the Recapitalization. In addition, we issued 426,666 shares of common stock to certain investors for an aggregate of $97,000, which funds were used solely to retire the outstanding shares in the Recapitalization and to pay outstanding payables of the Company as of closing. These payments included satisfaction of a promissory note in the principal amount of $56,465 and payables to the transfer agent, accountants and Denali legal counsel at the time. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; In connection with the Transaction, the board of directors of the Company, or the Board, was expanded from one to three members, the sole prior director, Mathew G. Rule, resigned, and the following new directors were appointed: Dr. Pnina Fishman, Dr. Ilan Cohn and Guy Regev, each of whom was, and currently is, a director of Can-Fite. On February 2, 2012, the number of directors was increased to four persons and Dr. Roger Kornberg was appointed as the fourth director and on July 1, 2013, the number of directors was increased to five persons and Dr. Michael Belkin was appointed as the fifth director. &#160; 

Upon completion of the Transaction and after giving effect to the Financing, the Recapitalization, and the shares issued to raise funds to satisfy outstanding financial obligations existing prior to the closing of the Transaction, we had an aggregate of 10,441,251 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Of these shares Can-Fite owned approximately 82% of our Company and assumed control of us. 

&#160; 

With the completion of the Transaction, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, became a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutic products for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. 

&#160; 

On January 25, 2012, we changed our name and trading symbol on the OTCQB to OphthaliX Inc. and OPLI, respectively. On February 6, 2012, Can-Fite, our majority stockholder owning 8,563,251 shares or approximately 82% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and voting rights, by written consent approved a change of the state of incorporation of the Company from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware by merging the Company into OphthaliX Inc., a newly formed Delaware company, and approved an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation to change the capitalization of the Company by increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000. The effective date for the approval of the change of domicile to the State of Delaware and the increase in the authorized shares of common stock was April 2, 2012. 

&#160; 

On July 18, 2013, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of one share for each four and one-half shares outstanding (1:4.5). The reverse split became effective as of the close of business on August 6, 2013.
