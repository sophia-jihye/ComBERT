 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

Computer Programs and Systems, Inc. ("we," "CPSI" or the "Company"), founded in 1979, is a leading provider of healthcare information technology ("IT") solutions and services for rural and community hospitals and post-acute care facilities. With our January 2016 acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. ("HHI"), CPSI is now the parent of five companies - Evident, LLC ("Evident"), TruBridge, LLC ("TruBridge"), Healthland Inc. ("Healthland"), American HealthTech, Inc. ("AHT"), and Rycan Technologies, Inc. ("Rycan"). Our combined companies are focused on improving the health of the communities we serve, connecting healthcare communities for a better patient care experience, and improving the financial operations of our customers. The individual contributions of each of our five wholly-owned subsidiaries towards this combined focus are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Evident, formed in April 2015, provides comprehensive electronic health record ("EHR") solutions and services for rural and community hospitals, including those solutions previously sold under the CPSI name as well as an expanded range of offerings specifically targeting rural and community healthcare organizations. 

&#8226; 

TruBridge focuses exclusively on providing business management, consulting and managed IT services to rural and community healthcare organizations, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider. 

&#8226; 

Healthland, acquired in the acquisition of HHI, provides integrated technology solutions and services to small rural and critical access hospitals. 

&#8226; 

AHT, acquired in the acquisition of HHI, is one of the nation's largest providers of financial and clinical technology solutions and services for post-acute care facilities. 

&#8226; 

Rycan, acquired in the acquisition of HHI, provides revenue cycle management workflow and automation software to hospitals, healthcare systems, and skilled nursing organizations. 

The combined company currently supports approximately 1,300 acute care facilities and over 3,300 post-acute care facilities with a geographically diverse customer mix within the domestic rural and community healthcare market. The company has a limited presence in the international healthcare IT marketplace after completing a new system installation in the Caribbean nation of St. Maarten during 2014. 

Our target market includes rural and community hospitals with 300 or fewer acute care beds. Our primary focus within this defined target market is on hospitals with 100 or fewer acute care beds, which comprise approximately 95% of our hospital EHR customer base. In addition to our target market, we provide information technology services to other entities in the healthcare industry, such as nursing homes, home health agencies and physician clinics. During 2015 , we generated revenues of $182.2 million &#32;from the sale of our products and services, excluding the products and services of HHI as the acquisition of HHI did not occur until January 2016. 

Industry Dynamics 

The healthcare industry is the largest industry in the United States economy, comprising approximately 17.5% of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2014 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). CMS estimates that by fiscal 2024 total U.S. healthcare spending will reach $5.4 trillion, or 19.6% of the estimated U.S. gross domestic product. 

Hospital services represents one of the largest categories of total healthcare expenditures, comprising approximately 32.1% of total healthcare expenditures in 2014 according to the CMS. According to the American Hospital Association&#8217;s AHA Hospital Statistics, 2016 Edition , there are approximately 4,100 &#32;community hospitals in the United States that are in our target market of hospitals with 300 or fewer acute care beds, with approximately 2,600 &#32;of those in our primary area of focus of 100 or fewer acute care beds. In addition, there is a market of small specialty hospitals that focus on discrete medical areas such as surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care. 

Notwithstanding the size and importance of the healthcare industry within the United States economy, the industry is constantly challenged by changing economic dynamics, increased regulation and pressure to improve the quality of healthcare. These challenges are particularly significant for the hospitals in our target market due to their more limited financial and human resources and their dependency on Medicare and Medicaid populations for a substantial portion of their revenue. However, we believe healthcare providers can successfully address these issues with the help of advanced medical information systems and 

Index to Financial Statements 

our suite of complementary services. Specific examples of the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare providers include the following: 

Changing Economic Dynamics. &#32;The economy of the healthcare industry, although not immune to general macroeconomic conditions, is heavily impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal and state governments. These legislative and regulatory initiatives have a particularly significant impact on our customer base, as rural and community hospitals typically generate a significant portion of their revenues from beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Consequently, even small changes in these federal and state programs have a disproportionately larger impact on rural and community hospitals as compared to larger facilities where greater portions of their revenues are typically generated from beneficiaries of private insurance programs. Medicare funding and reimbursements fluctuate year to year and, with the growth in healthcare costs, will continue to be scrutinized as the federal government attempts to control the costs and growth of the program. The Medicaid program, which is a federal/state program managed by the individual states and dependent in part on funding from the states, also continues to experience funding issues due to the increasing cost of healthcare and limited state revenues. 

Mandatory cuts in federal spending resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 became effective on March 1, 2013. Although Medicaid is specifically exempted from the cuts mandated by the legislation, it includes a reduction of up to 2% in federal Medicare spending, all of which will be achieved by reduced reimbursements to healthcare providers. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"), contains a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare and Medicaid program spending by significant amounts, many of which are already in effect. As the federal government seeks in the future to further limit deficit spending due to fiscal restraints, it will likely continue to cut entitlement spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid matching grants which will place further cost pressures on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Furthermore, federal and state budget shortfalls could lead to potential reductions in funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Reductions in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid could lead to hospitals postponing expenditures on information technology. 

While legislative and regulatory initiatives are placing significant pressure on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, our customer base of rural and community hospitals is also likely faced with increases in demand for Medicare and Medicaid services. We expect that the demand for Medicare and Medicaid services will increase for the foreseeable future due to the growing number of people born during the post-World War II baby boom becoming eligible for Medicare benefits at age 65 and states electing to expand Medicaid coverage under the provisions of the ACA. The challenges posed by this dual-threat of increased demand for Medicare and Medicaid services and downward pressure on reimbursements are further complicated by the shift away from volume-based reimbursement towards value-based reimbursement, linking reimbursement to quality measurements and outcomes. 

To compete in the continually changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly using technology in order to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices, to assist in enhancing patient care, and to maintain the privacy and security of patient information. Healthcare providers are placing increased demands on their information systems to accomplish these tasks. We believe that information systems must facilitate management of patient information across administrative, financial and clinical tasks. Information systems must also effectively interface with a variety of payor organizations within the increasingly complex reimbursement environment. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. &#32;In 2009, the U.S. federal government enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the "ARRA"), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"). HITECH authorized the EHR incentive program, which provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The level to which healthcare providers must prove they are effectively utilizing such solutions in order to qualify for these incentives is measured through an escalating criteria designated as "meaningful use." As a result of our obtaining the required certifications and our track record with our hospital customers successfully achieving meaningful use, the ARRA has had and should continue to have a positive impact on our business and the businesses of the rural and community hospitals that comprise our target market. 

Continued Push for Improved Patient Care . With the increased pressure to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety, driven in part by the general shift towards value-based reimbursement, hospitals are actively seeking information technology solutions for clinical decision support. This migration toward clinical decision support solutions is further supported by the ARRA. Provisions of the ARRA offered incentives for hospitals to become meaningful users of EHRs through September 2015. Hospitals and healthcare providers that did not implement and demonstrate meaningful use of EHRs by October 1, 2014 were penalized with lower Medicare payment levels after that date. 

Index to Financial Statements 

In the face of decreasing revenue and increasing pressure to improve patient care, healthcare providers are in need of management tools and related services that (1) increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services, (2) reduce medical errors, (3) effectively track the cost of delivering services so those costs can be properly managed and (4) increase the speed and rate of reimbursement. A hospital&#8217;s failure to adequately invest in a modern medical information system could result in fewer patient referrals, cost inefficiencies, lower than expected reimbursement, increased malpractice risk and possible regulatory infractions. 

Despite challenging economic conditions, we believe the industry has increased and will continue to increase its adoption of information technology as a management tool, particularly as a result of the ARRA. Additionally, we believe that the industry will continue to increase its utilization of third party services that contribute to the achievement of these and other objectives necessary for success in the current environment. We believe these dynamics should allow for future revenue growth for both our information technology solutions and our complementary suite of services. 

Our Solutions 

We have tailored information technology solutions that effectively address the specific needs of small and midsize hospitals. Due to their smaller operating budgets, rural and community hospitals have limited financial and human resources to operate manual or inefficient information systems. However, these hospitals are expected to achieve the same quality of care and regulatory compliance as larger hospitals, placing them in a particularly difficult operating environment. These pressures on the operating environments of rural and community hospitals were increased with the passage of the ARRA in 2009 which, in addition to providing incentives to healthcare providers to achieve meaningful use of EHR, has resulted in lowered Medicare payment levels for healthcare providers that have yet to achieve meaningful use of EHR. 

We believe that our information technology solutions meet these challenges facing rural and community hospitals by providing fully integrated, enterprise-wide and ARRA certified medical information systems and services that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and that collect, process, retain and report data in the primary functional areas of a hospital, from patient care to clinical processing to administration and accounting. As a key component of our complete solutions, we provide ongoing customer service through regular interaction with customers, customer user groups and extensive customer support. Further, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, TruBridge, we offer business management, consulting and managed IT services that allow customers to avoid some of the fixed costs of a business office and leverage our expertise and resources in helping them identify their IT objectives, define the best way to meet those requirements and manage the resulting projects and associated technologies. As a result, we are capable of providing a single-source solution for small and midsize hospitals, making us a partner in their initiatives to improve operations and medical care. 

Our customers continually communicate with us through our support teams and through organized user groups, allowing us to continue to provide state-of-the-art solutions that meet their specific needs. By remaining sensitive and responsive to the ever-changing demands of our customers and regularly updating our products, we believe that we provide information technology solutions that meet the needs of rural and community hospitals. Our business has continued to grow because we have successfully addressed the needs of rural and community hospitals for fully integrated, enterprise-wide information systems that allow them to improve operating effectiveness, reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care. 

In January 2013, we formed TruBridge as a wholly-owned subsidiary focusing exclusively on providing business management, consulting and managed IT services to rural and community healthcare organizations. While our traditional customer base for these services has been those rural and community healthcare organizations who have selected CPSI as their single-source healthcare information solutions provider, the formation of TruBridge has allowed for an improved focus of our marketing and service delivery resources and assist us in expanding the customer base for these service offerings to all rural and community healthcare organizations, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider. 

In April 2015, we announced the formation of Evident, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CPSI. Evident provides EHR solutions previously sold under the CPSI name as well as an expanded range of offerings specifically targeting rural and community healthcare organizations. Our objectives with the creation of Evident are to further differentiate our system and support offerings in our core target market, broaden the positioning of our EHR solution and offer a new range of solutions to address current and upcoming needs of rural and community healthcare providers. With the formation of Evident came the introduction of our EHR solution under the name Thrive and our unique collaborative support model under the name LikeMind. 

January 2016 marked an important milestone for CPSI, as we announced the completion of our acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. ("HHI"), the first major acquisition in the Company's history. We believe the acquisition of HHI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

Index to Financial Statements 

&#8226; 

strengthens our position in providing healthcare information systems to rural and community healthcare organizations with the addition of Healthland; 

&#8226; 

introduces CPSI to the post-acute market with the addition of AHT; and 

&#8226; 

expands the products and capabilities of TruBridge with the addition of Rycan and its suite of revenue cycle management products. 

Strategy 

Our objective is to continue to increase our share of the electronic health record ("EHR") and healthcare business management services markets for rural and community healthcare providers. The healthcare industry is in the midst of transitioning its focus from EHR implementations as a result of Meaningful Use to EHR optimization, value-based reimbursement, care coordination and interoperability. Our strategy is to position our services and solutions with rural and community healthcare providers so they are able to respond to these changes positively by enabling them to improve community health and connect providers and patients within the community and with other communities, while improving financial operations. We intend to leverage several strengths to accomplish this goal. 

Market Share/Scale &#32;&#32; 

Our solutions and services are used by approximately 1,300 hospitals, which represents approximately 26% of all inpatient acute care community hospitals nationally and approximately 31% of the community hospital market with 300 or fewer beds. Our post-acute care EHR is used by approximately 3,300 skilled nursing facilities, which represents a 24% market share. In 2015, our EHRs addressed more than 18 million patient encounters. We believe the size of our client base and scale of our development and client support resources is a positive factor for rural and community healthcare providers looking for a long term partner with a proven track record in meeting the unique needs of community healthcare. 

EHR Solutions Across the Care Continuum 

Our EHR solutions now address the entire continuum of care, with systems that address the three primary care settings; ambulatory care, inpatient acute care and post-acute care. This enables providers to coordinate patient care across the major settings where care is delivered. As accountable care organizations continue to increase their focus on care coordination, our ability to bridge care settings with integrated solutions will be a competitive advantage. 

Solutions and Services to Address Value-Based Reimbursement 

With the continued emphasis on value-based reimbursement models, data analytics has become a critical tool for rural and community healthcare providers to enable them to shift from reactive to proactive care delivery. We currently offer business intelligence as the first facet of a three-phase approach to analytics solutions, which we plan to expand to include predictive and prescriptive analytics. Because of the complexity inherent in data analytics, we will provide services to healthcare providers to assist them with certain aspects of data modeling and data analysis. 

Interoperability 

We currently provide integration across our ambulatory and inpatient EHR solutions. This integration will be expanded to encompass our post-acute care EHR product in 2016. In addition, as a founding member of the CommonWell Health Alliance we enable healthcare organizations to identify, confirm and link patient encounters across the CommonWell network. This translates into patient data that is not only shareable within communities but across communities as well. 

Focus on the Financial Health of Community Healthcare Providers 

Given the ongoing transition to value-based reimbursement models, rural and community healthcare providers are under more financial pressure than ever before. Our accounts receivable management services incorporate proven workflow and processes as well as industry leading revenue cycle management tools. A new aspect of many current payment models is an increasing shift of the financial burden to the patient. Community hospitals typically underperform in private pay collections because of the nature of community healthcare but cannot afford to forego the patient portion of contributions. Through our private pay services, providers can bring in much needed private pay receipts without alienating the local community. 

Our operational expertise and technology tools provide proven results in improving claim acceptance rates, accelerating payments from third party payers and increasing private pay collections. We also differentiate our services by working to maintain employment in the community by hiring local provider employees to continue their role under our services program.

Explore Additional Revenue Streams that Complement Existing Markets, Solutions and Services 

In the EHR space we are selling our ambulatory EHR solutions on a standalone basis with a focus on communities that currently already have one of our EHR solutions installed in an acute care setting. Also, we are actively pursuing expansion of our inpatient EHR product into the Canadian market through our own direct efforts and collaboration with key Canadian technology providers. In the United States EHR market, we are targeting other types of providers who have lagged behind inpatient acute care in EHR adoption such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral health facilities and inpatient psychiatric hospitals. In the post-acute care market, we are now providing an EHR solution for assisted living facilities in conjunction with our own post-acute care EHR for skilled nursing operators. In the services business we will continue to look for opportunities to add or increase services resulting from changing market dynamics, availability of technology or operational expertise, or changes in regulatory requirements. 

Our Products and Services 

New Products 

During 2015 our development efforts focused on the completion and release of (1) an iPad application, (2) Clinical Content, and (3) IdentiReg. 

&#8226; 

The iPad application provides users with access to our EHR system from Apple iOS devices. The initial focus is on providers, with the first function delivered through the app being access to our mobile rounding suite. This suite provides physicians with quick access to patient charts allowing for the review of patient information, vitals, medication lists, test results, problems and history. Additionally, it allows the providers to pend orders and set reminders for later tasks to be performed from a PC. 

&#8226; 

Clinical Content works in conjunction with our existing Emergency Department suite, Multi-Disciplinary Documentation application and Thrive Provider EHR. This content provides structured specialty-specific patient care documentation using our managed entry methodology and content. Our new Content Services Department oversees the creation and maintenance of this, ensuring the product reflects on-going best practices. 

&#8226; 

IdentiReg integrates biometric fingerprint scanners into the patient registration process. The application provides a means to positively identify individual patients and provides protection against identity theft and fraud. 

Development efforts in 2016 include (1) Meaningful Use Stage 3, (2) CommonWell interoperability, and (3) expansion of data analytics. 

&#8226; 

Final rules regarding Meaningful Use ("MU") Stage 3 for electronic health records were released in October 2015. Hospitals may begin reporting for MU Stage 3 requirements as early as January 1, 2017. The volume and complexity of changes associated with MU Stage 3 are considerable. MU Stage 3 increases the data capture requirements and use of medical vocabularies, expands Stage 2 functionality requirements, increases interoperability requirements and emphasizes greater patient engagement. To meet the requirements, new data elements and functionalities must be created and tied to the existing data structure and system functionalities in a manner that is consistent with healthcare provider workflows. 

&#8226; 

CPSI is a participant in the CommonWell Health Alliance. The purpose of the alliance is to develop and implement an interoperability standard for the communication of patient data between disparate EHR systems. We are taking a phased approach to development. In the first phase, we developed the ability for participating customers to automatically submit a small amount of patient demographic data. This phase helped to prove the concept of the alliance and is helping to build the network of EHR systems participating in the CommonWell Health Alliance. The second and current phase of development will focus on integrating CommonWell patient engagement and enrollment into the registration process. The final phase will focus on providing healthcare providers with a means to query and retrieve clinical documentation from other CommonWell member facilities. 

&#8226; 

We will be continuing our development efforts in data analytics in 2016. Our first pilot program focusing on predictive data modeling, scoring, categorization and classification was completed in 2015. While we continue our work on predictive analytic solutions, current market demand appears strong for business intelligence solutions. Consequently, our current development efforts are focused on dashboard software and the development of a library of financial, clinical and operational metrics to help improve outcomes and better manage hospital operations.

Remote access using the Application Portal results in no discernible difference to the user in software functionality. 

Healthland 

Our acquisition of HHI in January 2016 introduced the products and services of Healthland to our already broad suite of EHR product offerings provided through Evident. Healthland currently has two platforms that make up its collective EHR offering, primarily serving rural and community hospitals with 50 and fewer beds across the United States. Details regarding each platform are below: 

Healthland Centriq&#174; 

This web-based EHR platform was brought to market in 2011 as a next-generation alternative solution to Healthland Classic and serves as Healthland&#8217;s primary MU compliant platform for rural and community hospitals. The Centriq platform is designed to be an intuitive user interface that is easy for clinicians to use and attractive to both patients and clinicians. Additionally, as a web-based platform, users are able to connect to the system from any device that is connected to the Internet. Ease of use combined with Centriq&#8217;s ability to centralize data from various care areas, including Long Term Care, Home Health, and Ambulatory settings, provides the end user with a powerful tool to view past and present patient information with ease. Healthland EHR platforms have achieved a 99.0% attestation rate among its clients. Key Centriq&#174; capabilities include: 

&#8226; 

Computerized Practitioner Order Entry ("CPOE") . The cornerstone of inpatient EHR systems, CPOE promotes user adoption by including medication interaction alerts, access to relevant laboratory results, duplicate order checking, customizable order sets and protocols, and order templates containing pre-populated screens. 

Index to Financial Statements 

&#8226; 

Clinical Documentation . This system securely enables a patient&#8217;s caregivers to view the vital signs, intake-output values, progress notes, and nursing tasks that are entered into the patient&#8217;s EHR. 

&#8226; 

Emergency Department . This system expedites and simplifies registration, patient tracking, order management, assessments, and other activities in a fast-paced environment. 

&#8226; 

Laboratory . This system automates routine tasks such as lab order processing and tracking, enabling the practitioner to focus on the results and ultimately better patient care. 

&#8226; 

Radiology . This application delivers faster turnaround times and enhanced communications among caregivers by automatically processing radiology orders, managing and tracking images, and generating reports. 

&#8226; 

Pharmacy . This application helps pharmacies manage all aspects of medication verification and dispensing, including order coordination, interaction checks, administration, and charging. 

Following the completed acquisition of HHI, CPSI is committed to investing in, developing, and supporting the Centriq platform. Centriq must remain a viable solution for the Healthland clients we serve. Therefore, we have committed to our clients consistent delivery of product and regulatory enhancements, including a fully certified Centriq solution for MU Stage 3, for at least seven years. 

Healthland Classic 

Healthland&#8217;s original EHR platform, Classic was designed specifically for both rural and community hospitals and post-acute care facilities. In 2013 and 2014, Healthland upgraded Classic to be MU Stage 2 compliant, but has since announced to its customers that Classic will not be made MU Stage 3 compliant. 

Healthland continues to support the system and CPSI has committed to providing at least two years' notice before sunsetting Classic. Approximately 60 of the remaining 190 Classic customers are non-acute care facilities that are not compelled to follow or become compliant with MU standards, as there are no financial incentives available to non-acute care facilities for MU compliance. An additional 40 Classic customers have already begun the migration from Classic to Centriq, with another 25 expected to migrate in 2016. Beyond sales activity already underway, the Classic platform will no longer be offered as a new installation to prospective customers now that the acquisition of HHI has closed. 

Beyond inpatient EHR, Healthland offers a suite of integrated applications for managing operations, resources, and people, in addition to ambulatory information management solutions. Such products include: 

&#8226; 

Financial Accounting . A hospital financial accounting management solution that helps rural and community hospitals gain better insight and perspective on their costs. 

&#8226; 

Patient Management . An accounting system to better manage patient information and automate the hospital billing process.

Each offers a broad set of features and functionalities that can help clinics reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve administrative and clinical staff efficiency, all while enhancing patient care and safety. 

Post-Acute Care Software Systems 

Our acquisition of HHI in January 2016 also introduced CPSI to the post-acute care market through the products and services of AHT. AHT, a leading provider of integrated solutions to the post-acute care industry, was acquired by HHI in May 2013 and offers software solutions that promote data-driven clinical and financial outcomes for the customers they serve. AHT's comprehensive, long-term care management solutions include: 

&#8226; 

Care Management . This integrated offering helps manage the delivery of quality care, collect and report on resident information, and manage compliance risk. Core modules include Work Center, Clinical, Smart Charting Order Administration (Point of Care), Quality Assurance, Therapy Tracking, Supplies Tracking, and Disease State Management. 

Index to Financial Statements 

&#8226; 

Financial and Enterprise Management . This comprehensive set of financial solutions enables customers to improve cash flow and better manage costs. Core modules include Accounts Payable, General Ledger, Payroll, Financial Management, Trust Funds, and Enterprise Management.

Software Releases . We are committed to providing our customers with software and technology solutions that will continue to meet their information system needs. To accomplish this purpose, we continually work to enhance and improve our application programs. As part of this effort, for each customer covered under our general support agreement, we provide software updates as they become available at no additional cost. We design these enhancements to be seamlessly integrated into each customer&#8217;s existing Thrive system. The benefit of these enhancements is that each customer, regardless of its original installation date, uses the most advanced Thrive software available. Through this process, we can keep our customers up-to-date with the latest operational innovations in the healthcare industry as well as with changing governmental regulatory requirements. Another benefit of this "one system" concept is that our customer service teams can be more effective in responding to customer needs because they maintain a complete understanding of and familiarity with the one system that all customers use. 

Purchasing a new information technology system requires the expenditure of a substantial amount of capital and other resources, and many customers are concerned that these systems will become obsolete as technology changes. Our periodic product updates eliminate our customers&#8217; concerns about system obsolescence. We believe providing this benefit is a strong incentive for potential customers to select our products over the products of our competitors. 

&#8226; 

Hardware Replacement . As part of our general support agreements, we are also committed to promptly replacing malfunctioning system hardware in order to minimize the effect of operational interruptions. By offering all hardware used in our system, we believe we are better able to meet and address all of the information technology needs of our customers. 

&#8226; 

Cloud Electronic Health Record (EHR) . In some circumstances, we offer Cloud EHR services to customers via remote access telecommunications. Cloud EHR is a "Software as a Service" (or "SaaS") configuration and is in essence a subscription to access and use application software maintained by CPSI in a cloud environment for a monthly fee. Under this configuration, a customer is able to obtain access to an advanced EHR without a significant initial capital outlay. We store and maintain all Cloud EHR customers&#8217; critical

patient and administrative data using TruBridge Cloud Computing Services. These customers access this information remotely through direct telecommunications connections. 

&#8226; 

Forms and Supplies . We offer our customers the forms that they need for their patient and financial records, as well as their general office supplies. Furnishing these forms and supplies helps us to achieve our objective of being a one-source solution for a hospital&#8217;s complete healthcare information system requirements.

System Implementation and Training 

Conversion Services . When a customer purchases one of our systems, we convert its existing data to the purchased system. Our knowledge of hospital data processing, in conjunction with extensive in-house technical expertise, allows us to accomplish this task in a cost effective manner. When we install a new system, the data conversion has already occurred so that the system is immediately operational. Our goal is for each customer to be immediately productive in order not to waste time and money on the costly and inefficient task of maintaining the same data on parallel systems. Our services also relieve the hospital staff of the time-consuming burden of data conversion. The conversion process is the initial phase of our LikeMind support model. 

Training . In order to integrate the new system and to ensure its success, we spend approximately three to four weeks providing individualized training on-site at each customer&#8217;s facility at the time of installation. We directly train all hospital users, including staff members and healthcare providers, during all hospital shifts in the use of hardware and software applications. We employ nurses, medical technicians, and providers in addition to our technical training staff in order to help us communicate more effectively with our customers during the training process. This training phase is also part of the LikeMind support model that is provided to all of our customers. 

Product Development and Enhancement 

The healthcare information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to continually make investments to update, enhance and improve our products and services. These investments have resulted in total expenditures related to our Product Development Services division of approximately $14.2 million, $14.6 million, and $14.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, with approximately $2.9 million , $2.9 million &#32;and $2.8 million , respectively, incurred in the development of new products and services and significant improvements to existing products or services. 

Customers, Sales and Marketing 

Target Markets . The target market for our acute care EHR systems consists of community hospitals of 300 or fewer acute care beds, with a primary focus on hospitals with 100 or fewer acute care beds. In the United States, there are approximately 4,100 community hospitals with 300 or fewer acute care beds, with approximately 2,600 of these having 100 or fewer acute care beds. In addition, we market our products to small specialty hospitals in the United States that focus on discrete medical areas such as behavioral health, surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have installed our systems in over 950 facilities in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Approximately 95% of our existing customers are hospitals with 100 or fewer acute care beds, while approximately 99% of our existing customers are hospitals with 200 or fewer acute care beds. 

The target market for our post-acute care EHR solution consists of approximately 13,750 long-term care and skilled nursing facilities in the United States. In addition, through a strategic relationship with Medtelligent, we are able to market an EHR for assisted living facilities to our clients and potential clients who operate these facilities in conjunction with post-acute care operations. As of the date of this filing, we have installed our post-acute care EHR solution in approximately 3,300 facilities in 49 states. 

The target market for our business management, consulting and managed information technology services consists of small to mid-size hospitals in the United States. There are approximately 4,100 of these hospitals of 300 beds or less. In addition, we are now marketing our services to post-acute care facilities in the United States, of which there are approximately 

Index to Financial Statements 

13,750. As of the date of this filing, there are 864 healthcare providers who use our business management services, 320 who use our managed information technology services, and 223 who use our consulting services. 

In the acute care provider market, we are now actively marketing our EHR system in Canada. We have established business relationships with key Canadian technology providers which we believe will be a significant factor in penetrating the Canadian market. We have concluded our evaluation of the unique requirements of the Canadian healthcare system and are actively working on incorporating the necessary changes into our Thrive acute care EHR product. Domestically, we are actively selling our ambulatory EHR system on a stand-alone basis, with a focus on physician practices located in the same communities as our client hospitals. We believe this would include a significant number of unique physician practices. 

Our goals in the inpatient hospital market are threefold: (1) target those hospitals under 100 beds in the United States that we believe are currently using a vendor that we have determined is vulnerable based on a variety of factors, (2) continue our efforts to expand into the Canadian market through active marketing efforts and establishing business relationships with Canadian information technology providers, and (3) selectively target hospitals in the 100 to 300 bed market that we believe offer a reasonable chance of sales success based on size, location and other factors. Our goal in the ambulatory market is to aggressively target physician practices in those communities where the local hospital is a current CPSI client. 

Our goal in the post-acute care market is to continue to target both individual facilities as well as larger multi-facility corporate entities. In addition, we intend to extend our penetration into the post-acute care market by offering an assisted living facility EHR solution that we believe will broaden the appeal of our solutions to those operators who offer multiple care settings in their organizations.

Sales Staff . We have dedicated sales organizations in all three business lines: acute care EHR, post-acute care EHR and business management, consulting and managed information technology services. Many of our sales personnel are hired from within the company and have previous experience in client support roles. We believe this experience positions them to more effectively sell our products and services within our target markets. Our sales organizations are generally divided in four areas; sales management, new client sales, existing client sales and sales support staff. New client sales staff are typically organized based on geographic territories, though we also have sales personnel that focus on national accounts in our post-acute EHR business due to the number of national chain operators in that market. Our sales representatives who sell to existing customers have assigned clients within their territory, which is also geographically based. Some sales representatives in our services areas are assigned specifically to cross-sell services into our acute care EHR and post-acute care EHR client bases. A significant portion of the compensation for all sales personnel except for administrative support staff is commission based. 

Marketing Strategy . Our corporate marketing strategy is to leverage our EHR solutions to all providers across the care continuum, with a primary focus on the community healthcare market. We believe our ability to serve ambulatory, acute and post-acute care settings with our products will be especially appealing as new reimbursement models force the coordination of care by healthcare providers. Our ability to connect patients to care providers within their community and across communities through our own products and interoperability development, including our membership in the CommonWell Health Alliance, sets us apart from other competitors in our market. We also believe as the EHR market in the acute care environment transitions from implementation to optimization that our data analytics solutions will be a key differentiator for our EHR solutions. Our goal is to position ourselves as partners to community healthcare providers as they move to a more proactive care model based on the use of data analytics and patient engagement tools. 

With regard to business management, consulting and managed information technology services, we will continue to leverage our proven track record of success in accounts receivable management and private pay collections for community 

Index to Financial Statements 

healthcare providers. With the increasing complexity of reimbursement requirements and a global shift in healthcare towards an increase in patient financial responsibility, the ability of our services business to bring expertise and best practice operational efficiencies to bear is a significant competitive advantage. In consulting services, the added complexity brought about by the transition to the ICD-10 code set has created a significant demand for our coding services. Our strategy is to leverage any services engagement, whether business, IT or consulting, into opportunities to cross-sell other services to the client. 

Backlog 

Backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts. The revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one-time fees for system sales and recurring fees for support and maintenance, business management, consulting and managed IT services. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $14 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $136 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance, business management, consulting and managed IT services. The backlog amounts exclude amounts to be recognized in subsequent periods related to First Generation Meaningful Use Installment Plans (see Management's Discussion and Analysis for a detailed discussion of these arrangements). As of December 31, 2014 , we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $36 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $123 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance, business management, consulting and managed IT services. 

Competition 

The market for our products and services is competitive, and we expect additional competition from established and emerging companies in the future. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, global shifts in the healthcare system, evolving user needs and impactful regulatory and reimbursement changes. We believe the principal competitive factors that hospitals and post-acute care providers consider when choosing between us and our competitors are: 

&#8226; 

product features, functionality and performance; 

&#8226; 

range of services offered; 

&#8226; 

level of customer service and satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

ease of integration and speed of implementation; 

&#8226; 

product price; 

&#8226; 

cost of services offered; 

&#8226; 

results of services engagements; 

&#8226; 

knowledge of the healthcare industry; 

&#8226; 

sales and marketing efforts; and 

&#8226; 

company reputation. 

Our principal competitors in the acute care EHR market are Medical Information Technology, Inc. ("Meditech"), athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation and MEDHOST, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of small and midsize hospitals. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of hospitals in the markets we serve. 

Our secondary competitors in the acute care EHR market include McKesson Corporation, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., and Epic Systems Corporation. These companies are significantly larger than we are, and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market. However, they will sometimes compete with us directly or, more commonly, a larger health system who uses a system from one of these companies will offer it to a smaller hospital as part of a merger or alliance. 

We also face competition from providers of practice management systems, general decision support and database systems and other segment-specific applications. Any of these companies as well as other technology or healthcare companies could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Our principal competitors in the post-acute care EHR market are PointClickCare Corporation, MatrixCare, Inc. and HealthMEDX, LLC. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of long-term post-acute care facilities. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of long-term care providers. 

Our principal competitors in the business management, consulting and managed information technology services market are Healthcare Resource Group, Inc., Resolution Health, Inc., The Outsource Group Inc. and Patient Focus, Inc. All of these companies provide one or more of the services we offer, with their primary focus being on business management services. The services they offer are comparable in scope to the competing services we offer. These companies all focus on providing services to the healthcare market. Secondary competitors include ARx LLC, Pioneer Health Services, Inc., Citadel Outsource Group LLC and Patient Matters, LLC. 

Health Information Security and Privacy Practices 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") is a federal law that affects the use, disclosure, transmission and storage of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as "protected health information," and that was enacted for the purpose of, among other things, protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. As directed by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (the "DHHS") has promulgated standards and rules for certain electronic health transactions, code sets, data security, unique identification numbers and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA and the standards promulgated by DHHS apply to certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as "covered entities"), which includes our hospital customers. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations published in January 2013 (the "HITECH Act") significantly expand HIPAA by extending privacy and security standards to "business associates" of healthcare providers that are covered entities. Under the HITECH Act, business associates are required to establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards and are subject to direct penalties for violations. Certain of our services frequently entail us acting as a healthcare clearinghouse and/or in the capacity of a business associate to the hospitals that we serve. As a result, we are covered by the patient privacy and security standards of HIPAA and subject to oversight by DHHS. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to comply with HIPAA, as it applies to us as a business associate, but it is important to note that DHHS could, at any time in the future, adopt new rules or modify existing rules in a manner that could require us to change our systems or operations. 

Protecting individually identifiable health information and other sensitive data is a critical and essential function of CPSI&#8217;s software solutions. A variety of industry-standard approaches which meet or exceed regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and HITECH are employed. In order to avoid unauthorized access for the life span of this data, diverse methods of identification, authentication, authorization and encryption are utilized at various points throughout the operating system, application software and hardware. These methods and processes are shared amongst servers and other end-user devices and are complemented by change management processes and tools which allow the software change control cycle to be a formal, defined process. 

Intellectual Property 

We regard some aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely primarily on a combination of contract and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We believe, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services. We cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. 

We do not believe our software products or other CPSI proprietary rights infringe on the property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,500 employees, the substantial majority of which are located at our offices in Mobile, Fairhope, and Lanett, Alabama and Monroe, Louisiana. With our acquisition of Healthland Holding Inc. on January 8, 2016, we added approximately 460 employees to our workforce, primarily located in various locations in Minnesota and in Ridgeland, Mississippi. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
