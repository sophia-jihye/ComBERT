Item 1. Business 

We operate in two segments: the direct selling segment where products are offered through a global distribution network of preferred customers and distributors and the commercial coffee segment where products are sold directly to businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 89% of our revenue from our direct sales and approximately 11% of our revenue from our commercial coffee sales. 

&#160;

We consider our company to be an e-commerce company whereby personal interaction is provided to customers by our Youngevity(R) Essential Life Sciences independent sales network.

We own a traditional coffee roasting business that produces coffee under its own Caf&#233; La Rica brand, Josie&#8217;s Java House Brand and Javalution brands. CLR produces a variety of private labels through major national sales outlets and to major customers including cruise lines and office coffee service operators, as well as through our distributor network. Our coffee manufacturing division, CLR, was established in 2003 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary. CLR produces and markets a unique line of coffees with health benefits under the JavaFit(R) brand which is sold directly to consumers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In March 2014, we expanded our coffee segment and started our new green coffee business with CLR&#8217;s acquisition of Siles Plantation Family Group, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of CLR. Siles Plantation Family Group acquired in May 2014: (i) La Pita,&#8221; a dry-processing facility on approximately 26 acres of land in Matagalpa, Nicaragua; (ii) &#8220;El Paraiso,&#8221; a coffee plantation located in Matagalpa, Nicaragua consisting of approximately 450 acres of land and thousands of coffee plants; and (iii) we have paid a deposit to purchase &#8220;El Paraisito,&#8221; an approximate 450 acre plantation located adjacent to El Paraiso. Each plantation is roughly 450 acres and produces 100 percent Arabica coffee beans that are shade grown, Rainforest Alliance Certified(TM) and Fair Trade Certified(TM). The 50,000 square foot drying facility is SQF Level 2 certified, which is a stringent food safety auditing process that verifies the coffee bean processing plant and distribution facility is in compliance with Certified HACCP (Hazard Analysis, Critical Control Points) food safety plans. 

The two plantations are located on adjacent plots of land and when coupled with our recently acquired dry-processing facility and existing U.S. based coffee roaster facilities allows CLR to control the coffee production process from field to cup. The dry-processing plant allows CLR to produce and sell green coffee to major coffee suppliers in the United States and around the world. CLR has engaged a husband and wife team to operate the Siles Plantation Family Group by way of an operating agreement. The agreement provides for the sharing of profits and losses generated by the Siles Plantation Family Group after certain conditions are met. CLR has made substantial improvements to the land and facilities since 2014 and plans to continue improvements through 2016. The 2016 harvest season started in November 2015 and will continue through April of 2016.

Coffee Segment - CLR Roasters, LLC (&#8220;CLR&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Our coffee line initially began in 2003 with the formation of Javalution. Javalution, through its JavaFit Brand, develops products in the relatively new category of fortified coffee. JavaFit fortified coffee is a blend of roasted ground coffee and various nutrients and supplements. On July 11, 2011, our AL Global Corporation, a privately held California corporation (&#8220;AL Global&#8221;), merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution Coffee Company, a publicly traded Florida corporation (&#8220;Javalution&#8221;). After the merger, Javalution reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Youngevity International, Inc., effective July 23, 2013. In connection with this merger, CLR, which had been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution prior to the merger, continued to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CLR operates a traditional coffee roasting business, and through the merger we were provided access to additional distributors, as well as added the JavaFit&#174; product line to our network of direct marketers. 

Our JavaFit line of coffee is only sold through our direct selling network. CLR produces coffee under its own brands, as well as under a variety of private labels through major national retailers, various office coffee and convenience store distributors, to wellness and retirement centers, to a number of cruise lines and cruise line distributors, and direct to the consumer through sales of the JavaFit Brand to our direct selling division. 

&#160; 

In addition, CLR produces coffee under several company owned brands including: Caf&#233; La Rica, Caf&#233; Alma, Josie&#8217;s Java House, Javalution Urban Grind, Javalution Daily Grind, and Javalution Royal Roast. These brands are sold to various internet and traditional brick and mortar retailers including Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie, Jetro, American Grocers, Publix, Home Goods, Marshalls and TJ Maxx. 

During 2015 CLR invested in the K-Cup coffee equipment and capabilities and began the production of the K-Cup line of single-serve coffee products. In addition, we registered our own Y-Cup&#174; trademark for Youngevity identification to expand the business brand name. 

CLR&#8217;s green coffee business provides for the sale of green coffee beans to other roasters and distributors, primarily from the distribution of coffee beans from Nicaragua.

The commercial coffee segment&#8217;s revenues were 11% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

Direct Selling Segment - We presently sell products in 70 countries and territories, including all 50 states in the U.S., with operations in the U.S. and currently six international distribution centers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 approximately 7% of our sales were derived from sales outside the U.S. We primarily sell our products to the ultimate consumer through the direct selling channel. Our distributors are required to pay a one-time enrollment fee and receive a welcome kit specific to that country region that consists of forms, policy and procedures, selling aids, and access to our distributor website, prior to commencing services for us as a distributor. Distributors are independent contractors and not our employees. Distributors earn a profit by purchasing products directly from us at a discount from a published brochure price and selling them to their customers, the ultimate consumer of our products. We generally have no arrangements with end users of our products beyond the distributors, except as described below. No single distributor accounts for more than 2% of our net sales. 

&#160; 

A distributor contacts customers directly, selling primarily through our online or printed brochures, which highlight new products and special promotions for each of our sales campaigns. In this sense, the distributor, together with the brochure, is the &#8220;store&#8221; through which our products are sold. A brochure introducing new sales campaigns is frequently produced and our websites and social networking activity take place on a continuous basis. Generally, distributors and customer&#8217;s forward orders using the internet, mail, telephone, or fax and payments are processed via credit card or other acceptable forms of payment at the time an order is placed. Orders are processed and the products are assembled primarily at our distribution center in Chula Vista, California and delivered to distributors, distribution centers and customers through a variety of local, national and international delivery companies. 

&#160; 

We employ certain web enabled systems to increase distributor support, which allow distributors to run their business more efficiently and also allow us to improve our order-processing accuracy. In many countries, distributors can utilize the internet to manage their business electronically, including order submission, order tracking, payment and two-way communications. In addition, distributors can further build their own business through personalized web pages provided by us, enabling them to sell a complete line of our products online. Self-paced online training is also available in certain markets, as well as up-to-the-minute news, about us. 

&#160; 

In the U.S. and selected other markets, we also market our products through the following consumer websites: 

&#160; 

&#9679;

&#9679;

&#160; 

&#160;

The recruiting of new distributors and the training are the primary responsibilities of key independent distributors supported by our marketing staff. The independent distributors are independent contractors compensated exclusively based on total sales of products achieved by their down-line distributors and customers. Although the independent distributors are not paid a fee for recruiting additional distributors, they have the incentive to recruit additional distributors to increase their opportunities for increasing their total sales and related sales commissions. Acquisitions of other direct selling businesses and personal contacts, including recommendations from current distributors, and local market advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new distributors and customers. Distributors also have the opportunity to earn bonuses based on the net sales of products made by distributors they have recruited and trained in addition to discounts earned on their own sales of our products. This program can be unlimited based on the level achieved in accordance with the compensation plan that can change from time to time at our discretion. The primary responsibilities of sales leaders are the prospecting, appointing, training and development of their down-line distributors while maintaining a certain level of their own sales. 

&#160; 

Coffee Segment &#8211; The coffee segment is operated by CLR. The segment operates a coffee roasting plant and distribution facility located in Miami, Florida. The 39,500 square foot plant contains two commercial grade roasters and four commercial grade grinders capable of roasting 10 million pounds of coffee annually. The plant contains a variety of packaging equipment capable of producing two ounce fractional packs, vacuum sealed brick packaging for espresso, various bag packaging configurations ranging from eight ounces up to a five pound bag package, as well as Super Sack packaging that holds bulk coffee up to 1,100 pounds. 

&#160; 

The versatility of the plant supports a diverse customer base. The coffee segment is a large supplier to the hospitality market with a great focus on serving the cruise line industry. A major revenue producing area is the private label market where the company produces coffee for various retailer owned private brands. The segment supplies coffee and equipment to retirement communities, services the office coffee service segment, and markets through distributors to the convenient store market; CLR also markets its own brands of coffee to various retailers. Company owned brands that are currently on retail shelves are Caf&#233; La Rica, Josie&#8217;s Java House, and the Javalution stable of brands. 

&#160; &#160; 

The coffee segment also includes our green coffee business. CLR sources green coffee from Nicaragua in Central America and sells procured coffee to other coffee distributors. In addition, with the recent acquisition of the Nicaragua plantation and dry-processing facility we are able to further expand our coffee segment with the ability to process green coffee not only for our own use but also expand this service to other coffee growers. 

&#160; 

Seasonality and Back Orders 

&#160; 

Our business in both the direct selling and coffee segment can experience weaker sales during the summer months; however, based on recent experience, seasonality has not been material to our operation results. We have not experienced significant back orders. 

&#160; 

Promotion and Marketing 

&#160; 

Direct Selling Segment - Sales promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting distributors through sales aids such as brochures, product samples and demonstration products. In order to support the efforts of distributors to reach new customers, specially designed sales aids, promotional pieces, customer flyers, radio and print advertising are used. In addition, we seek to motivate our distributors through the use of special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic sales meetings with our independent distributors are conducted by the Company&#8217;s marketing staff. The meetings are designed to keep distributors abreast of product line changes, explain sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance. 

&#160; 

A number of merchandising techniques are used, including the introduction of new products, the use of combination offers, the use of trial sizes and samples, and the promotion of products packaged as gift items. In general, for each sales campaign, a distinctive brochure is published, in which new products are introduced and selected items are offered as special promotions or are given particular prominence in the brochure. A key current priority for our merchandising is to continue the use of pricing and promotional models to enable a deeper, fact-based understanding of the role and impact of pricing within our product portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Coffee Segment &#8211; Sales promotion and sales development primarily take place via CLR in-house team, however, we utilize commission only outside manufacturers&#8217; representatives for a number of specialty accounts. CLR works diligently to be sure that the Company is invited to participate in the request for proposal (&#8220;RFP&#8221;) process that comes up each year on major coffee contracts. CLR Roasters in-house sales team consists of five people that devote the majority of their time to obtaining new business. CLR has established a direct store distribution (&#8220;DSD&#8221;) route that it utilizes to market, promote and ship its Caf&#233; La Rica and Josie&#8217;s Java House brands. Various promotion strategies and advertisements in retail circulars are utilized to support the brands being marketed through DSD. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

Direct Selling Segment - We purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers. Other than the coffee products produced through CLR, all of our products are manufactured by independent suppliers. To achieve certain economies of scale, best pricing and uniform quality, we rely primarily on a few principal suppliers, namely: Global Health Labs, Inc., Pacific Nutritional, Inc. and Nutritional Engineering, Inc. 

Sufficient raw materials were available during the year ended December 31, 2015 and we believe they will continue to be. We monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs, and the market conditions for these raw materials. We believe we will be able to negotiate similar market terms with alternative suppliers if needed. 

Coffee Segment - We currently source green coffee from Nicaragua. For large contracts, CLR from time to time locks in a price with its suppliers to protect CLR and its customers from price fluctuations that take place in the commodities market. 

&#160; 

We purchase our inventory from multiple third-party suppliers at competitive prices. For the year ended December 31, 2015 we made purchases from three vendors that individually comprised more than 10% of total purchases and in aggregate approximated 61% of total purchases for the two segments. We will also be able to produce green coffee from CLR&#8217;s own plantation it acquired in Nicaragua in 2014. We do not believe that CLR is substantially dependent upon nor exposed to any significant concentration risk related to purchases from any single vendor, given the availability of alternative sources from which we may purchase inventory. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have developed and we use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own several trademarks that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and we also own trademarks in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico, and Russia. Registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered trademark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third-party in the respective country of registration, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. 

&#160; 

We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of our brands and the effective marketing of our products. We intend to maintain and keep current all of our trademark registrations and to pay all applicable renewal fees as they become due. The right of a trademark owner to use its trademarks, however, is based on a number of factors, including their first use in commerce, and trademark owners can lose trademark rights despite trademark registration and payment of renewal fees. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete, and if for any reason we were unable to maintain our trademarks, our sales of the related products bearing such trademarks could be materially and negatively affected. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Most of our products are not protected by patents and therefore such agreements are often our only form of protection. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets, but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws. 

&#160; 

We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

We are engaged in two industries, the direct selling industry and the sale of coffee industry. 

Direct Selling Industry 

&#160; 

Direct selling is a business distribution model that allows a company to market its products directly to consumers by means of independent contractors and relationship referrals. Independent, unsalaried salespeople, referred to as distributors, represent us and are awarded a commission based upon the volume of product sold through each of their independent business operations. 

&#160; 

According to the World Federation of Direct Selling Association 2015 annual report, it is estimated that 2014 retail sales for the direct selling channel increased 5.5% to $34.7 billion from $32.7 billion in 2013. The direct selling channel in the US has seen a compounded annual growth rate between 2011 and 2014 of 4.9%. Driving industry growth is the increase in the number of people involved in direct selling, which increased 8% to nearly 18.2 million in 2014 from 16.8 million in 2013. In 2014, the number of people active in direct selling reached 18.2 million stemming from the recession of 2009 reflecting people losing their jobs, thus seeking to earn money as a direct selling organization. The World Federation of Direct Selling Association 2015 annual report reports that the top product categories continue to gain market share: nutrition, beauty, home care, jewelry, clothing, home d&#233;cor, energy, telecommunications products, legal and services. Wellness products include weight-loss products and dietary supplements. 

Coffee Selling Industry 

According to IBIS World industry March 2016 reports 51121c. &#8220;Coffee Production and Demand in the U.S.&#8221;, d uring the past five years, the coffee production industry fared well, exhibiting revenue growth due to increases in input commodity prices that were passed on to customers. Moreover, in the next five years, the industry is expected to benefit from consumer demand for premium-coffee products. As the world price of coffee is expected to grow, coffee producers are expected to benefit from less volatile input commodity prices, compared with the previous period. As a result, we anticipate that coffee producers will be able to &#160; efficiently reflect input commodity pricing in their coffee prices. The strong demand projection comes at a time of squeezed global coffee supplies, which pushed prices to multiyear highs last year following a historic drought in Brazil, the world&#8217;s largest grower. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Direct Selling Segment &#8211; The diet fitness and health food industries, as well as the food and drink industries in general, are highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant change. The number of competitors in the overall diet, fitness, health food, and nutraceutical industries is virtually endless. We believe that existing industry competitors are likely to continue to expand their product offerings. Moreover, because there are few, if any, substantial barriers to entry, we expect that new competitors are likely to enter the &#8220;functional foods&#8221; and nutraceutical markets and attempt to market &#8220;functional food&#8221; or nutraceutical coffee products similar to our products, which would result in greater competition. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in this extremely competitive market. 

&#160; 

We face competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Worldwide, we compete against products sold to consumers by other direct selling and direct-sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing competition in our developing and emerging markets. 

&#160; 

Within the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis, with our direct selling competitors. There are also a number of direct selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. We compete against large and well-known companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments such as General Foods and Nestle. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell in narrower product lines sold through retail establishments. This industry is highly competitive, and some of our principal competitors in the industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. We have many competitors in the highly competitive energy drink, skin care and cosmetic, coffee, pet line and pharmacy card industries globally, including retail establishments, principally department stores, and specialty retailers, and direct-mail companies specializing in these products. Our largest direct sales competitors are Herbalife, Amway, USANA and NuSkin. In the energy drink market we compete with companies such as Red Bull, Gatorade and Rock Star. Our beauty, skin care and cosmetic products compete with Avon and Bare Essentials. From time to time, we need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures or to maintain our position in the marketplace. Such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. Any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices when raw material costs increase, would harm profit margins and, if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, our results of operations would suffer. 

We are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing distributors. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining distributors will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for distributors, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing distributors or deplete the pool of potential distributors in a given market. 

&#160; 

Coffee Segment &#8211; With respect to our coffee products, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label or generic products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers&#8217; willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to maintain consumer confidence that our products are of a higher quality and provide greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, then consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. If we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors in specialty coffee, including by developing and maintaining our brands, or our competitors adopt our strategies, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales of specialty coffee, and accordingly our profitability, may be materially adversely affected. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a &#8220;health claim.&#8221; Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. 

&#160; 

Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, impose significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of &#8220;serious adverse events&#8221; to FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we manufacture and sell. 

These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA&#8217;s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, there are an increasing number of laws and regulations being promulgated by the U.S. government, governments of individual states and governments overseas that pertain to the Internet and doing business online. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. Laws or regulations have been or may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet; 

&#9679; 

online content regulation; 

&#9679; 

commercial e-mail; 

&#9679; 

visitor privacy; and 

&#9679; 

taxation and quality of products and services. 

&#160; 

Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

intellectual property ownership and infringement; 

&#9679; 

consumer protection; 

&#9679; 

obscenity; 

&#9679; 

defamation; 

&#9679; 

employment and labor; 

&#9679; 

the protection of minors; 

&#9679; 

health information; and 

&#9679; 

personal privacy and the use of personally identifiable information. 

&#160; 

This area is uncertain and developing. Any new legislation or regulation or the application or interpretation of existing laws may have an adverse effect on our business. Even if our activities are not restricted by any new legislation, the cost of compliance may become burdensome, especially as different jurisdictions adopt different approaches to regulation. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation, recognition, and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as &#8220;pyramid&#8221; schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part. 

&#160; 

Management Information, Internet and Telecommunication Systems 

&#160; 

The ability to efficiently manage distribution, compensation, inventory control, and communication functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success. 

We continue to upgrade systems and introduce new technologies to facilitate our continued growth and support of independent distributor activities. These systems include: (1) an internal network server that manages user accounts, print and file sharing, firewall management, and wide area network connectivity; (2) a leading brand database server to manage sensitive transactional data, corporate accounting and sales information; (3) a centralized host computer supporting our customized order processing, fulfillment, and independent distributor management software; (4) a standardized telecommunication switch and system; (5) a hosted independent distributor website system designed specifically for network marketing and direct selling companies; and (6) procedures to perform daily and weekly backups with both onsite and offsite storage of backups. 

Our technology systems provide key financial and operating data for management, timely and accurate product ordering, commission payment processing, inventory management and detailed independent distributor records. Additionally, these systems deliver real-time business management, reporting and communications tools to assist in retaining and developing our sales leaders and independent distributors. We intend to continue to invest in our technology systems in order to strengthen our operating platform. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Product Returns 

&#160; 

Our return policy in the direct selling segment provides that customers and distributors may return to us any products purchased within 30 days of their initial order for a full refund. Product damaged during shipment is replaced. Product returns as a percentage of our net sales have been approximately 1% of our monthly net sales over the last two years. Commercial coffee segment sales are only returnable if defective. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 18, 2016, we had 382 employees worldwide. We believe that our current personnel are capable of meeting our operating requirements in the near term. We expect that as our business grows we may hire additional personnel to handle the increased demands on our operations and to handle some of the services that are currently being outsourced, such as brand management and sales efforts. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

Youngevity International, Inc., formerly AL International, Inc., founded in 1996, operates through the following domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries: AL Global Corporation, which operates our direct selling networks, CLR, our commercial coffee business, Financial Destinations, Inc., FDI Management, Inc., and MoneyTrax, LLC; (collectively referred to as &#8220;FDI&#8221;), MK Collaborative LLC, Youngevity Global, LLC and the wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries Youngevity Australia Pty. Ltd. and Youngevity NZ, Ltd. In addition the Company formed seven international business subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014: Siles Plantation Family Group S.A. located in Nicaragua (subsidiary of CLR), Youngevity Mexico S.A. de CV, Youngevity Israel, Ltd., Youngevity Russia, LLC, Youngevity Colombia S.A.S, Singapore PTE LTD and Mialisia Canada, Inc. 

Effective July 23, 2013, we changed our name from AL International, Inc. to Youngevity International, Inc. 

On July 11, 2011, AL Global Corporation, a privately held California corporation (&#8220;AL Global&#8221;), merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution Coffee Company, a publicly traded Florida corporation (&#8220;Javalution&#8221;). After the merger, Javalution reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Youngevity International, Inc., effective July 23, 2013. In connection with this merger, CLR, which had been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution prior to the merger, continued to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CLR operates a traditional coffee roasting business, and through the merger we were provided access to additional distributors, as well as added the JavaFit&#174; product line to our network of direct marketers. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), which was enacted in April 2012. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 

&#160; 

(a) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; 

(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement; 

(c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, during the previous 3-year period, issued; or. 

(d) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. 

&#160; 

As an emerging growth company we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval, on an advisory basis, of executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

&#160;

RISK FACTORS 

&#160; 

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should be able to bear the complete loss of your investment. You should carefully consider the risks described below and, the other information in the documents incorporated by reference herein when evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or a part of the money paid to buy our common stock. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Because we have recently acquired several businesses and significantly increased our investment in our green coffee business, it is difficult to predict to what extent we will be able to maintain or improve our current level of revenues and profitability 

&#160;

No assurances can be given as to the amount of future revenue or profits that we may generate. Until recently, our business was comprised primarily of the direct sales of Youngevity(R) health products. In the last four years, we completed 15 business acquisitions of companies in the direct selling line of business, substantially increasing our Youngevity health product lines. It is too early to predict whether consumers will accept, and continue to use on a regular basis, the products we added from these new acquisitions since we have had limited recent operating history as a combined entity. In addition, we have recently acquired a dry-processing plant and a coffee plantation in Nicaragua and are in the process of expanding our product line with the purchase of K-Cup manufacturing capabilities which we launched in May 2015. It is too early to predict the results of our capital investment in the green coffee business. 

&#160; 

Our business is difficult to evaluate because we have recently expanded our product offering and customer base. 

&#160; 

We have recently expanded our operations, engaging in the sale of new products through new distributors. There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses with our current management and structure. Although we are based in California, several of the businesses we acquired are based in other places such as Utah and Florida, making the integration of our newly acquired businesses difficult. In addition, our dry-processing plant and coffee plantation is located overseas in the country of Nicaragua. Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our newly acquired businesses are based on the historical experience of management and businesses they are familiar with. Our management has limited direct experience in operating a business of our current size as well as one that is publicly traded. 

&#160; 

Our ability to generate profit will be impacted by payments we are required to make under the terms of our acquisition agreements, the extent of which is uncertain. 

&#160; 

Since many of our acquisition agreements are based on future consideration, we could be obligated to make payments that exceed expectations. Many of our acquisition agreements require us to make future payments to the sellers based upon a percentage of sales of products. The carrying value of the contingent acquisition debt, which requires re-measurement each reporting period, is based on our estimates of future sales and therefore is difficult to accurately predict. Profits could be adversely impacted in future periods if adjustment of the carrying value of the contingent acquisition debt is required. 

&#160; 

We may have difficulty managing our future growth. 

&#160; 

Since we initiated our network marketing sales channel in fiscal 1997, our business has grown significantly. This growth has placed substantial strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. If we are able to continue to expand our operations, we may experience periods of rapid growth, including increased resource requirements. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we may need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the financing for any of future acquisitions could dilute the interests of our stockholders; resulting in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Future acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel; 

&#9679; 

diversion of management's attention from our core business; 

&#160; &#9679; 

adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms. 

&#160; &#160; 

The failure to comply with the terms of our outstanding Notes could result in a default under the terms of the notes and, if uncured, it could potentially result in action against the pledged assets of CLR. 

&#160; 

We have issued $7,187,500 of convertible notes (the &#8220;November 2015 Notes) to investors in November 2015 (the &#8220;November 2015 Offering&#8221;) that are secured by certain of our assets and those of CLR other than its inventory and accounts receivable. We have also issued an additional $4,750,000 in principal amount of notes (the &#8220;September 2014 Notes&#8221;) in September 2014 Offering (the &#8220;September 2014 Offering&#8221;) secured by CLR&#8217;s pledge of the Nicaragua green coffee beans acquired with the proceeds, the contract rights under a letter of intent and all proceeds of the foregoing (which lien is junior to CLR&#8217;s factoring agreement and equipment lease but senior to all of its other obligations), Stephan Wallach, our Chief Executive Officer, has also personally guaranteed the repayment of the notes, and has agreed not to sell, transfer or pledge 30 million shares of our common stock that he owns so long as his personal guaranty is in effect. The November 2015 Notes mature in 2018, and the September 2014 Notes mature in 2019 and require us, among other things, to maintain the security interest given by CLR for the notes, make quarterly installments of interest, reserve a sufficient number of our shares of common stock for conversion requests and honor any conversion requests made by the investors to convert their notes into shares of our common stock. If we fail to comply with the terms of the notes, the note holders could declare a default under the notes and if the default were to remain uncured, as secured creditors they would have the right to proceed against the collateral secured by the loans. Any action by secured creditors to proceed against CLR assets or our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our coffee and direct selling operations. 

We generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of The Beyond Tangy Tangerine line, Osteo-fx line and, Ultimate EFA line of products. A decrease in sales of these products could seriously harm our business. 

A significant portion of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 50%, was derived from sales of our Beyond Tangy Tangerine line, Osteo-fx line and Ultimate EFA line of products. Any disruption in the supply of the raw materials used for these problems, any negative press associated with these products or manufacture and sale of competitive products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our business is subject to strict government regulations. 

&#160; 

The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a &#8220;health claim.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. 

&#160; 

Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S.3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of &#8220;serious adverse events&#8221; to FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we manufacture and sell. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA&#8217;s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. 

&#160; 

Unfavorable publicity could materially hurt our business. 

&#160; 

We are highly dependent upon consumers&#8217; perceptions of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, as well as products distributed by other companies. Future scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to our industry or any particular product. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the consumption of our product or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on us. Such adverse publicity could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from failure to consume such products as directed. Adverse publicity could also increase our product liability exposure, result in increased regulatory scrutiny and lead to the initiation of private lawsuits. 

&#160; 

Product returns may adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

We are subject to regulation by a variety of regulatory authorities, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration. The failure of our third party manufacturers to produce merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards could damage our reputation and brands and lead to customer litigation against us. If our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to remove merchandise or issue voluntary or mandatory recalls of those products at a substantial cost to us. We may be unable to recover costs related to product recalls. We also may incur various expenses related to product recalls, including product warranty costs, sales returns, and product liability costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. While we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty costs in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, selling products for human consumption such as coffee and energy drinks involve a number of risks. We may need to recall some of our products if they become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. We also may incur significant liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or in the event our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, we could be the target of claims that our advertising is false or deceptive under U.S. federal and state laws as well as foreign laws, including consumer protection statutes of some states. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. 

&#160; 

Returns are part of our business. Our return rate since the inception of selling activities has been minimal. We replace returned products damaged during shipment wholly at our cost, which historically has been negligible. Future return rates or costs associated with returns may increase. In addition, to date, product expiration dates have not played any role in product returns; however, it is possible they will increase in the future. 

&#160; 

A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. 

&#160; 

A downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions, or the current global macro-economic pressures, could adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. Recent global economic events over the past few years, including job losses, the tightening of credit markets and failures of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic or operational challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to issue commercial paper, raise additional capital and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances. An adverse change in our credit ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on our ability to access certain debt markets, including the commercial paper market. 

&#160; 

Consumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. We face continued economic challenges in fiscal 2016 because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and sharply falling home prices, among other things. 

&#160; 

In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions as a result of a terrorist attack similar to the events of September 11, 2001, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, war, adverse weather conditions and climate changes or other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, pandemic situations or large scale power outages can have a short or, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending. 

&#160; 

We face significant competition. 

&#160; 

We face competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Worldwide, we compete against products sold to consumers by other direct selling and direct-sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing competition in our developing and emerging markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Within the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis, with our direct selling competitors. There are also a number of direct selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. We compete against large and well-known companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments. Our largest direct sales competitors are Herbalife, Amway, USANA and NuSkin. In the energy drink market we compete with companies such as Red Bull, Gatorade and Rock Star. Our beauty, skin care and cosmetic products compete with Avon and Bare Escentuals. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell in narrower product lines sold through retail establishments. This industry is highly competitive and some of our principal competitors in the industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. From time to time, we need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures or to maintain our position in the marketplace. Such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. Any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices when raw material costs increase, would harm profit margins and, if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, our results of operations would suffer. 

&#160; 

If our advertising, promotional, merchandising, or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to deliver new products that represent technological breakthroughs, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, or if for other reasons our end customers perceive competitors' products as having greater appeal, then our sales and financial results may suffer. &#160; 

If we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors&#8217; products, including by developing and maintaining our brands or our competitors adopt our strategies, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales, and accordingly our profitability, may be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing distributors. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining distributors will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market, and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for distributors, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing distributors or deplete the pool of potential distributors in a given market. 

&#160; 

Our coffee segment also faces strong competition. The coffee industry is highly competitive and coffee is widely distributed and readily available. Our competition will seek to create advantages in many areas including better prices, more attractive packaging, stronger marketing, more efficient production processes, speed to market, and better quality verses value opportunities. Many of our competitors have stronger brand recognition and will reduce prices to keep our brands out of the market. Our competitors may have more automation built into their production lines allowing for more efficient production at lower costs. We compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label or generic products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers&#8217; willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to maintain consumer confidence that our products are of a higher quality and provide greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, then consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products. 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products, including the procedures we employ to detect the likelihood of hazard, manufacturing issues, and unforeseen product misuse. If our products are found to be, or are perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our distributors' or end customers' standards, our relationship with our distributors or end customers could suffer, we could need to recall some of our products, our reputation or the appeal of our brand could be diminished, and we could lose market share and or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could affect our financial results. 

&#160; 

Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge, and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences. We must continually work to discover and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze, and respond to consumer preferences, consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for beauty and related products and changing consumer demands, our financial results will suffer. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, material shifts or decreases in market demand for our products, including as a result of changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences or incorrect forecasting of market demand, could result in us carrying inventory that cannot be sold at anticipated prices or increased product returns. Failure to maintain proper inventory levels or increased product returns could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trademarks, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted. 

&#160; 

Most of our products are not protected by patents. The labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers. Accordingly, patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common. Additionally, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products, as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances. In this respect, we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better, purer, and more effective formulations of our products. We protect our investment in research, as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products, by relying on trade secret laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful. We intend to maintain and keep current all of our trademark registrations and to pay all applicable renewal fees as they become due. The right of a trademark owner to use its trademarks, however, is based on a number of factors, including their first use in commerce, and trademark owners can lose trademark rights despite trademark registration and payment of renewal fees. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete and if for any reason we were unable to maintain our trademarks, our sales of the related products bearing such trademarks could be materially and negatively affected. Nor can there be any assurance that third-parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of their intellectual proprietary rights. If an infringement claim is asserted, we may be required to obtain a license of such rights, pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis, or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products. Litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 

&#160; 

We consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffee and, therefore, essential to our various brands. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods, if such methods became known. If our competitors copy our roasting methods, the value of our brands could be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors. In addition, competitors could develop roasting methods that are more advanced than ours, which could also harm our competitive position. 

&#160; 

We may become involved in the future in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results. 

&#160; 

We may, in the future, become party to litigation. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect financial results. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation to which we may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be material. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. 

&#160; 

As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to direct selling in emerging and developing markets where we do business is evolving and officials in such locations often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations. Any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our distributors, are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and or reputation. Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and or reputation. 

&#160; &#160; 

The loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Our founder, Dr. Joel Wallach, is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business, and our message is based in large part on his vision and reputation, which helps distinguish us from our competitors. Any loss or limitation on Dr. Wallach as a lead spokesman for our mission, business, and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, our executive officers, including Stephan Wallach and David Briskie, are primarily responsible for our day-to-day operations, and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. We cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices, or at all, or the inability to obtain certain products from third-party suppliers or from our manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

We contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products, including most of our powdered drink mixes and nutrition bars, and certain of our personal care products. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations that have been developed by, or in conjunction with, our in-house product development team. There is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue manufacturing our products or selling their products to us. Although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products, with a resulting loss of net sales. In certain situations, we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source. We have, in the past, discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products that were manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order. There can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials or manufactured products that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay. Because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials and products, we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials, based on conditions not within our control, including weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, strikes by supplier employees, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Shortages of raw materials may temporarily adversely affect our margins or our profitability related to the sale of those products. 

&#160; 

We may experience temporary shortages of the raw materials used in certain of our nutritional products. While we periodically experience price increases due to unexpected raw material shortages and other unanticipated events, this has historically not resulted in a material effect on our overall cost of goods sold. However, there is no assurance that our raw materials will not be significantly adversely affected in the future, causing our profitability to be reduced. A deterioration of our relationship with any of our suppliers, or problems experienced by these suppliers, could lead to inventory shortages. In such case, we may not be able to fulfill the demand of existing customers, supply new customers, or expand other channels of distribution. A raw material shortage could result in decreased revenue or could impair our ability to maintain or expand our business. 

&#160; 

A failure of our information technology systems would harm our business. 

&#160; 

The global nature of our business and our seamless global compensation plan requires the development and implementation of robust and efficiently functioning information technology systems. Such systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters, telecommunication failures, and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations. 

We are dependent upon access to external sources of capital to grow our business. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy contemplates future access to debt and equity financing to fund the expansion of our business. The inability to obtain sufficient capital to fund the expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches. 

&#160; 

Our businesses involve the storage and transmission of users&#8217; proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. An increasing number of websites, including several large companies, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers&#8217; proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our customers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. 

&#160; 

Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Non-technical means, for example, actions by a suborned employee, can also result in a data breach. 

&#160; 

Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously damaged. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, &#8220;denial-of-service&#8221; type attacks and similar disruptions that could, in certain instances, make all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users&#8217; personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 

&#160; 

Our web customers, as well as those of other prominent companies, may be targeted by parties using fraudulent &#8220;spoof&#8221; and &#8220;phishing&#8221; emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to our customers&#8217; computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by our company, but they may direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate &#8220;spoof&#8221; and &#8220;phishing&#8221; emails through product improvements and user education, &#8220;spoof&#8221; and &#8220;phishing&#8221; remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage use of our websites, and increase our costs. 

Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks. 

Our green coffee business in based in Nicaragua. We own one plantation and intend to purchase another in Nicaragua. Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the possibility that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market; 

&#9679; 

the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas; 

&#9679; 

the presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets; 

&#9679; 

the possibility that a foreign government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on us or our coffee operations, or sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets; 

&#9679; 

the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and 

&#9679; 

the possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash. 

&#160; 

Currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 7% of our sales were derived from sales outside the United States. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities. 

&#160; 

Taxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business. 

&#160; 

As a multinational corporation, in several countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions. Regulators closely monitor our corporate structure, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

A change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results. In the event any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to us, these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition. 

&#160; 

Non-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business. 

&#160; 

Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;). Any allegations that we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, and other penalties. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to protect against violation of these laws, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective. We are aware that one of our direct marketing competitors is under investigation in the United States for allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in China and other markets. If this investigation causes adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of our industry, our business could be harmed. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR DIRECT SELLING BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Independent distributor activities that violate laws could result in governmental actions against us and could otherwise harm our business. 

&#160; 

Our independent distributors are independent contractors. They are not employees and they act independently of us. The network marketing industry is subject to governmental regulation. We implement strict policies and procedures to try to ensure that our independent distributors comply with laws. Any determination by the Federal Trade Commission or other governmental agency that we or our distributors are not in compliance with laws could potentially harm our business. Even if governmental actions do not result in rulings or orders against us, they could create negative publicity that could detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate independent distributors and attract customers. 

&#160; 

Network marketing is heavily regulated and subject to government scrutiny and regulation, which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets. 

&#160; 

Network marketing systems, such as ours, are frequently subject to laws and regulations, both in the United States and internationally, that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation, recognition, and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as &#8220;pyramid&#8221; schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part. Regulatory authorities, in one or more of our present or future markets, could determine that our network marketing system does not comply with these laws and regulations or that it is prohibited. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network-marketing channel in some countries, or we may be forced to alter our compensation plan. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change, which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets. This could be particularly detrimental to us if we had to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our net sales. For example, the FTC released a proposed New Business Opportunity Rule in April 2006. As initially drafted, the proposed rule would have required pre-sale disclosures for all business opportunities, which may have included network marketing compensation plans such as ours. However, in March 2008 the FTC issued a revised notice of proposed rulemaking, which indicates that the New Business Opportunity Rule as drafted will not apply to multi-level marketing companies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our principal business segment is conducted worldwide in one channel, direct selling and therefore any negative perceptive of direct selling would greatly impact our sales. 

&#160; 

Our principal business segment is conducted worldwide in the direct selling channel. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through independent distributors and customers worldwide. There is a high rate of turnover among distributors, which is a common characteristic of the direct selling business. As a result, in order to maintain our business and grow our business in the future, we need to recruit, retain and service distributors on a continuing basis and continue to innovate the direct selling model. Consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of products generally, or reducing purchases from distributors or buying products in channels other than in direct selling, such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our global business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our competitors establish greater market share in the direct selling channel, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any government bans or severely restricts our business method of direct selling, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Our ability to attract and retain distributors and to sustain and enhance sales through our distributors can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry, our competition, or our business generally. Negative public perception may include negative publicity regarding the sales structure of significant, pure network marketing companies which has been the case recently with large network marketing companies, the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically, and regulatory investigations, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our distributors or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies. Any adverse publicity may also adversely impact the market price of our stock and cause insecurity among our distributors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

As a network marketing company, we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products. 

&#160; 

We rely on non-employee, independent distributors to market and sell our products and to generate our sales. Distributors typically market and sell our products on a part-time basis and likely will engage in other business activities, some of which may compete with us. We have a large number of distributors and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our distributors. We rely primarily upon our distributors to attract, train and motivate new distributors. Our sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of our distributors. Our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new distributors, retaining and motivating our existing distributors, and in improving the productivity of our distributors. 

&#160; 

We can provide no assurances that the number of distributors will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase. Our distributors may terminate their services at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we experience a high turnover among new distributors from year-to-year. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of distributors because we primarily rely upon existing distributors to sponsor and train new distributors and to motivate new and existing distributors. Our operating results in other markets could also be adversely affected if we and our existing distributors do not generate sufficient interest in our business to successfully retain existing distributors and attract new distributors. 

&#160; 

The loss of a significant Youngevity distributor could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

We rely on the successful efforts of our distributors that become leaders. If these downline distributors in turn sponsor new distributors, additional business centers are created, with the new downline distributors becoming part of the original sponsoring distributor&#8217;s downline network. As a result of this network marketing system, distributors develop business relationships with other distributors. The loss of a key distributor or group of distributors, large turnover or decreases in the size of the key distributors force, seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume, sales volume reduction, the costs associated with training new distributors, and other related expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Moreover, our ability to continue to attract and retain distributors can be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

General business and economic conditions; 

&#9679; 

Adverse publicity or negative misinformation about us or our products; 

&#9679; 

Public perceptions about network marketing programs; 

&#9679; 

High-visibility investigations or legal proceedings against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens; 

&#9679; 

Public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional, personal care, or weight management products generally; 

&#9679; 

Other competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing distributors or reduce the potential pool of new distributors; and 

&#9679; 

Changes to our compensation plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that make attracting and retaining distributors more difficult. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain distributors in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain our present growth levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies. 

&#160; 

Some of our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Other products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. We conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products, but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies. Furthermore, because we are highly dependent on consumers' perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers' use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors. 

Our manufacturers are subject to certain risks. 

&#160; 

We are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturers and suppliers of products. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Challenges by private parties to the direct selling system could harm our business. 

&#160; 

Direct selling companies have historically been subject to legal challenges regarding their method of operation or other elements of their business by private parties, including their own representatives, in individual lawsuits and through class actions, including lawsuits claiming the operation of illegal pyramid schemes that reward recruiting over sales. We can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed if any such actions were brought against any of our current subsidiaries or any other direct selling company we may acquire in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

RISKS RELATED TO OUR COFFEE BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 

&#160; 

We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the &#8220;C&#8221; price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the &#8220;C&#8221; coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base &#8220;C&#8221; coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. 

&#160; 

These are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. We also enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and price are fixed. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 

&#160; 

Adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, as well as reports of incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or food contamination, whether or not accurate, could harm our business. 

&#160; 

Some of our products contain caffeine and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. In the United States, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products, frequently including caffeine. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products. 

&#160; 

Similarly, instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses, food tampering and food contamination, either during manufacturing, packaging or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of food tampering or food contamination could damage our brand value, severely hurt sales of our products, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. If consumers become ill from food-borne illnesses, tampering or contamination, we could also be forced to temporarily stop selling our products and consequently could materially harm our business and results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK 

&#160; 

We are controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. 

&#160; 

Through his voting power, Mr. Stephan Wallach, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of all of our directors. Mr. Wallach owns and beneficially owns approximately 72% of our total equity securities (assuming exercise of the options to purchase common stock held by Mr. Wallach and Michelle Wallach, his wife and Chief Operating Officer and Director). As our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wallach has the ability to control our business affairs. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, not being required to comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

&#160; 

We could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure may be more limited than that of other public companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies. 

&#160; 

Our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

&#160; 

We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

&#160; 

Our stock has historically had a limited market. If an active trading market for our common stock does develop, trading prices may be volatile. 

&#160; 

In the event that an active trading market develops, the market price of our shares of common stock may be based on factors that may not be indicative of future market performance. Consequently, the market price of our common stock may vary greatly. If an active market for our common stock develops, there is a significant risk that our stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

variations in our quarterly operating results; 

&#160;&#9679; 

announcements that our revenue or income/loss levels are below analysts&#8217; expectations; 

&#160;&#9679; 

general economic slowdowns; 

&#160;&#9679; 

changes in market valuations of similar companies; 

&#160;&#9679; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts; or 

&#160;&#9679; 

acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments. 

&#160; 

Because our shares are deemed &#8220;penny stocks,&#8221; an investor may have difficulty selling them in the secondary trading market. 

&#160; 

The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price, as therein defined, of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, if the equity security is not registered or authorized on a national securities exchange that makes certain reports available, the equity security may also constitute a &#8220;penny stock.&#8221; As our common stock comes within the definition of penny stock, these regulations require the delivery by the broker-dealer, prior to any transaction involving our common stock, of a risk disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and any salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. The ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of shareholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market would be limited. As a result, the market liquidity for our common stock would be severely and adversely affected. We can provide no assurance that trading in our common stock will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future, which would negatively affect the market for our common stock. 

&#160; 

We are subject to the reporting requirements of Federal Securities Laws, which can be expensive. 

&#160; 

We are subject to the information and reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC has and will continue to cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were a privately-held company. 

&#160; 

Sales by our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

&#160; 

A large number of outstanding shares of our common stock are held by several of our principal shareholders. If any of these principal shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 

&#160; 

Our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations. The price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or our competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the nutritional supplement industry, negative publicity, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have, in certain cases, not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies. Our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If that were to occur, the price of our common stock would likely decline, perhaps substantially. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We may issue preferred stock with rights senior to the common stock, which we may issue in order to consummate a merger or other transaction necessary to raise capital. 

&#160; 

Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;) without shareholder approval and on terms established by our directors. We may issue shares of preferred stock in order to consummate a financing or other transaction, in lieu of the issuance of common stock. The rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board of directors in its sole discretion and may have dividend, voting, liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of the common stock. 

&#160; 

You should not rely on an investment in our common stock for the payment of cash dividends. 

&#160; 

We intend to retain future profits, if any, to expand our business. We have never paid cash dividends on our stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. You should not make an investment in our common stock if you require dividend income. Any return on investment in our common stock would only come from an increase in the market price of our stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. 

&#160; 

Our failure to fulfill all of our registration requirements may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement that we entered into with investors in the November 2015 Offering and September 2014 Offering, we were required to file a registration statement with respect to securities issued to them within a certain time period and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements. 

&#160; 

There is no public market for the notes or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that were issued to investors in our Private Placements. 

There is no established public trading market for the warrants that were issued in the September 2014 Offering and the November 2015 Offering and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited. 

&#160; 

Due to the speculative nature of warrants, there is no guarantee that it will ever be profitable for investors who received warrants in our private placements to exercise their warrants. 

&#160; 

The warrants issued in the September 2014 Offering and the November 2015 Offering do not confer any rights of share ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent the right to acquire our common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Investors in the September 2014 Offering and the November 2015 Offering may exercise their right to acquire the shares of Common Stock underlying their warrants at any time after the date of issuance by paying the respective exercise price per share, prior to their expiration, after which date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no further value. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and, consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for investors to exercise their warrants. 

&#160;
