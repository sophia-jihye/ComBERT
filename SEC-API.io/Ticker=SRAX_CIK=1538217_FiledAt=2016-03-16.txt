 ITEM 1. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

We are an Internet advertising and platform technology company that provides tools to automate the digital advertising market. Our focus is to provide technology tools that enable both publishers and advertisers to maximize their digital advertising initiatives. We derive our revenues from:

&#183;

sales of digital media advertising campaigns to advertising agencies and brands;

&#183;

sales of media inventory through real-time bidding, or RTB, exchanges;

&#183;

sale and licensing of our SRAX Social platform and related media; and

&#183;

creation of custom platforms for buying media on SRAX for large brands.

SRAX &#150; Real Time Bidding sell side representation . Our technology assists publishers in delivering their media inventory to the RTB exchanges. An RTB exchange is a method of selling and buying online display advertising in real time, one ad impression at a time, utilizing computer algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time. Our tools provide reporting to these publishers about the sales of their media inventory on these exchanges. We believe that our tools assist publishers in maximizing their revenues. We contract with web and mobile publishers to sell their media inventory on the RTB exchanges by having the publisher sign up on our portal to become one of our publishing partners. Once the publisher signs up, the traffic they deliver is evaluated by us for fraud potential; once approved, we provide the publisher with technology that allow us to deliver advertising to their approved sites or applications. This includes providing the partner with technology from our advertising server that they then place onto their webpage. This &#34;tag&#34; allows us to fill advertising space on the publisher's website when we have an advertiser that would like to buy the space. Our platform presents all of the media inventory from our publishing partners to many different buyers at the same time, and then those buyers have the ability to bid on the inventory. Our system then takes the highest price offered and sells the space to that bidder. The price that advertisers are willing to pay for any specific placement is determined in real time and we seek to deliver the highest paid ad at any given time.

SRAX &#150; Real Time Bidding buy side representation. We also provide our SRAX platform to brands and their advertising agencies. We build custom platforms that allow our agency partners to launch and manage their own RTB campaigns by enabling them to directly place advertising orders on the platform dashboard and view and analyze results as they occur. These efforts involve working with the brand and agencies to understand their marketing objectives and then customizing our buying platform to allow these clients to import their own first party consumer targeting data to maximize their media buys. We also provide the clients access to third party consumer targeting data that allows them to further target their media buys. In some instances we provide these services on a managed basis where the clients provide us with an insertion order and we launch and manage the program on the SRAX platform on their behalf.

SRAX Social . SRAX Social is a social media and loyalty platform that allows brands to launch and manage their social media initiatives. We have found that many of our clients need to build a social media presence and SRAX Social provides the tools and services necessary to launch a presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and other social networks. Our team works with customers to identify their needs and then helps them in the creation, deployment and management of their social media presence. SRAX Social allows brand marketers to select from a number of pre-created applications, and then launch these applications and loyalty programs on their social media sites and their websites. With the addition of the SRAX platform, we are helping brands to identify their influencers and then, utilizing this first party data, we are creating &#34;look alike audiences.&#34; Look alike audiences are consumers who match the characteristics of the identified &#34;influencers.&#34; These consumers are likely to be influential to the brand. Once we create the &#34;look alike audience,&#34; we are able to reach these consumers across the web and on social networks through our SRAX platform. SRAX Social represents the combination and rebranding in 2015 of our GroupAd, SRAX DI and Five Delta offerings. 

SRAX MD . SRAX MD is an ad targeting and data platform for healthcare brands, agencies and medical content publishers. Healthcare and pharmaceutical publishers utilize the platform for yield optimization, audience extension campaigns and re-targeting of their healthcare professional audience. Agencies and brands purchase targeted digital and mobile ad campaigns.

SRAX APP . SRAX APP is a platform allows publishers and content owners to launch native mobile applications through our SRAX platform. Our platform takes our content partner's social and other content and creates an application that is placed in the Google Play Store and in the Apple App Store, as well as other application marketing locations to market the app. We are the owner of the application and share any revenue generated through the application with our content partners.

&#160;

Marketing and sales 

We market our services through our in house sales team, which is divided into two distinct activities. One group is responsible for brand advertisers and advertising agencies, and the other is responsible for publisher acquisition and management. Our in house marketing is focused on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as lead generation tools for our sales team. We also attend industry specific events such as AdTech, AdExchanger, and Salesforce annual events and local events in Los Angeles and New York.

We rely on our publishing partners to provide the media inventory that we sell and use to promote our marketing campaigns as well as to assist in driving user traffic to these campaigns.

Intellectual property 

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. Prior to our acquisition of Five Delta in December 2014, in October 2014 it filed a U.S. patent for a method and system for bidding and performance tracking using online advertisements and provisional status has been granted under 62/060,247. In addition, it claimed the benefit of a pending U.S. patent number 61/604,348 for online advertising scoring. The provisional patent application has now been converted to a non-provisional patent application number 12/960,435 and is awaiting examination by the Patent Office.

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include companies who focus on the RTB market and companies who are focused on providing social media applications on a managed and self-service basis. We believe we compete based on both our ability to assist our customers to obtain the best available prices as well as our excellent customer service. The barrier to entry to our industry is low. We believe that in the future we will face increased competition from these companies as they expand their operations as well as new entrants to our industry. Most of the entities against which we compete, or may compete, are larger and have greater financial resources than our company. Competition for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high-traffic websites and Internet service providers, as well as competition with other media for advertising placements, could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of publishers and other media companies across an increasing range of different services, including vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. We also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print, for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we fail to compete successfully, we could lose customers or media inventory and our revenue and results of operations could decline.

&#160;

Government regulation 

Aspects of the digital marketing and advertising industry and how our business operates are highly regulated. We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In particular, we are subject to rules of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to our advertising content and methods, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial electronic mail messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages that follow a recipient's opt-out request or are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and federal and state regulations covering the treatment of member data that we collect from endorsers.

U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving. We have not yet developed an internal compliance program nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners and advertising clients. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties including, but not limited to, fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon products or aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The FTC adopted Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising on October 5, 2009. These guides recommend that advertisers and publishers clearly disclose in third-party endorsements made online, such as in social media, if compensation was received in exchange for said endorsements. Because some of our marketing campaigns entail the engagement of consumers to refer other consumers in their social networks to view ads or take action, and both we and the consumer may earn cash and other incentives, and any failure on our part to comply with these guides may be damaging to our business. We currently do not take any steps to monitor compliance with these guides. In the event of a violation, the FTC could potentially identify a violation of the guides, which could subject us to a financial penalty or loss of endorsers or advertisers. 

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California's Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Any failure by us to comply with these privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the Internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect users' privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our business.

We generally only receive user data authorized through the Facebook user API. Access to such information, in addition to being limited in scope by Facebook policies and procedures, requires the affirmative authorization of the participating user, as stipulated by Facebook. In a campaign, we post a privacy policy and user agreement, which describe the practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of member data in connection with such campaign. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policy and user agreement could result in proceedings against us by users, customers, governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.

&#160;

Many states have passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personal data. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection. We partner with providers of data to acquire this data and we do not own this data. In addition, data protection laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States may be more restrictive, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.

Our users communicate across social and/or web-based channels. These communications are governed by a variety of U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. In the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for the distribution of &#34;commercial&#34; email messages for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product, service, or Internet website and provides for penalties for transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content or that do not give opt-out control to the recipient. The FTC is primarily responsible for enforcing the CAN-SPAM Act, and the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and Internet service providers also have authority to enforce certain of its provisions.

The CAN-SPAM Act's main provisions include:

&#160;

&#183;

prohibiting false or misleading email header information;

&#160;

&#183;

prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines;

&#160;

&#183;

ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender, with the opt-out effective within 10 days of the request;

&#160;

&#183;

requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively assented to receiving the message; and

&#160;

&#183;

requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message.

The CAN-SPAM Act preempts most state restrictions specific to email marketing. However, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult content or content regarding harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act.

Violations of the CAN-SPAM Act's provisions can result in criminal and civil penalties, including statutory penalties that can be based in part upon the number of emails sent, with enhanced penalties for commercial email senders who harvest email addresses, use dictionary attack patterns to generate email addresses, and/or relay emails through a network without permission.

With respect to text message campaigns, for example, the CAN-SPAM Act and regulations implemented by the FCC pursuant to the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Federal Do-Not-Call law, among other requirements, prohibit companies from sending specified types of commercial text messages unless the recipient has given his or her prior express consent. We, our users and our advertisers may all be subject to various provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act. If we are found to be subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, we may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business.

If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, other federal laws, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our users or any determination that we are directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business.

In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure.

&#160;

Employees 

At March 1, 2016 we had 43 full-time employees. We also contract for the services of an additional approximately 47 individuals from a third-party provider. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees. 

Our history 

We were originally organized in August 2009 as a California limited liability company under the name Social Reality, LLC, and we converted to a Delaware corporation effective January 1, 2012. Social Reality, LLC began business in May, 2010. Upon the conversion, we changed our name to Social Reality, Inc.

Acquisition of Steel Media 

On October 30, 2014, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Steel Media from Mr. Richard Steel pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 30, 2014, by and among our company, Steel Media and Mr. Steel. Founded in 1999, Steel Media provides digital advertising services and display, mobile, video and email advertising inventory to both brands and advertising agencies. As consideration for the purchase of Steel Media, we agreed to pay Mr. Steel up to $20 million, consisting of:

&#183;

a cash payment at closing of $7.5 million;

&#183;

a cash payment of $2 million which is being held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, dated October 30, 2014, by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, our company and Mr. Steel, which we refer to as the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to the extent such arise under the Stock Purchase Agreement;

&#183;

the Steel Note in the principal amount of $2.5 million which was secured by the 2,386,863 Escrow Shares; and

&#183;

earn out payments of up to $8 million.

The earn out consideration is payable upon the attainment of EBITDA targets of Steel Media during the two year period following the closing, 60% of which may be satisfied in shares of the our Class A common stock subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Further, in the event of:

&#183;

a change of control of our company or Steel Media, or

&#183;

Mr. Steel's termination without &#34;cause&#34; or resignation for &#34;good reason&#34; during the two year period following the closing,

we are obligated to pay Mr. Steel 100% of the earn out consideration (less any amount previously paid to Mr. Steel). To the extent we are prohibited from paying any earn out consideration in cash and Mr. Steel is prohibited from receiving same under the terms of the Subordination Agreement described elsewhere in this report, Mr. Steel has the right to request that we pay him the prohibited cash earn out payment in shares of our Class A common stock.

The EBITDA targets for the first earn out period ended October 31, 2015 were met which entitled Mr. Steel to an earn out payment of $4 million. In January, 2016 we paid Mr. Steel $1.6 million in cash and issued him 1,283,766 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $2.4 million in full payment of the first year earn out. 

The Steel Note bore interest at the rate of 5% per annum and the principal and accrued interest was due and payable on October 30, 2015. The Steel Note was also subject to certain mandatory partial prepayments for each of the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 in an amount equal to 25% of the &#34;Excess Cash Amount&#34; as defined in the Steel Note. We made a mandatory partial prepayment in August 2015, for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 in the amount of $241,737. On October 29, 2015 we paid Mr. Steel a total of $2,381,124 in full satisfaction of the remaining principal balance of the Steel Note and accrued but unpaid interest and the Steel Note was retired. 

&#160;

The obligations under the Steel Note were subordinated to our obligations under the Financing Agreement as described later in this report, pursuant to the terms of the Subordination Agreement and was secured by the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares were considered issued but not outstanding, and Mr. Steel did not have any voting or other rights as a stockholder to the Escrow Shares during the period they were held in escrow. The Escrow Shares were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement dated October 30, 2014 by and among Mr. Steel, Social Reality and Lowenstein Sandler LLP, as escrow agent. Following the satisfaction of the Steel Note, the escrow terminated, the Escrow Shares were returned to us and cancelled, returning to the status of authorized but unissued shares of our Class A common stock. 

On October, 30, 2014, in connection with the acquisition of Steel Media, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Mr. Steel pursuant to which we agreed to register any earn out shares issued to him. We granted Mr. Steel demand registration rights over the earn out shares which he may exercise 180 days after such shares are issued to him. In addition, Mr. Steel has the right to include any earn out shares issued to him in registration statements for offerings by us as well as offerings of our Class A common stock held by third parties. The terms of the Registration Rights Agreement contain underwriter and Rule 415 cutback provisions in which the number of earn out shares that we may include in a subsequent registration statement to be filed with the SEC will be reduced subject to certain allocation provisions as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. We agreed to pay all costs and expenses with such registration statement, other than Mr. Steel's selling expenses. The Registration Rights Agreement contains customary indemnification provisions. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, Mr. Steel agreed to certain restrictions on the amount of earn out shares that may be sold by him without our consent; provided, however, that these restrictions will automatically terminate upon our failure to fully pay the earn out consideration if and when due.

Acquisition of Five Delta 

On December 19, 2014 we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Five Delta in exchange for 600,000 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Acquisition and Exchange Agreement dated December 19, 2014 by and among Social Reality, Five Delta and the stockholders of Five Delta, which we refer to as the Five Delta Agreement. Five Delta is a managed advertising service that uses proprietary technology and methods to optimize digital advertising for its customers. Five Delta primarily utilizes quality first party data from platforms including Facebook, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Google in optimization decisions.

Under the terms of the Five Delta Agreement, 300,000 shares of the Class A common stock were deposited in escrow by the holders with the escrow agent pending satisfaction of certain post-closing conditions as described in the agreement. While the escrow shares remained in escrow, the holders granted Mr. Chris Miglino, our Chief Executive Officer, a voting proxy over the escrow shares. The Five Delta stockholders also granted us a right of first refusal over the shares of our Class A common stock tendered as consideration for a four year period from the closing date. The post-closing conditions were satisfied and the shares were released from escrow in December 2015. 

The Five Delta stockholders also entered into 24 month lock up agreements at the closing of the Five Delta Agreement. The lock up agreements provide that one-half of our shares of Class A common stock acquired in the transaction will be released from the lock up on the one year anniversary of the closing date, with the balance released on the two year anniversary of the closing date. Following the release of any of the shares from the lock up agreement, the holders agreed to limit the resale of such shares based upon a numerical formula tied to the trading volume of our Class A common stock and agreed that all permitted resales will be made at the then current bid price of our Class A common stock. The lock up automatically terminates upon a change of control of our company.
