 Item 1. Business. 

Introduction 

CBIZ has been operating as a professional services business since 1996. The Company built its professional services business through acquiring accounting and financial service providers, benefits and employee services firms, property and casualty brokerage firms, payroll service providers, and valuation and other service firms throughout the United States. CBIZ is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;) under the symbol &#147;CBZ&#148;. 

CBIZ provides professional business services, products and solutions that help its clients grow and succeed by better managing their finances and employees. These services are provided to businesses of various sizes, as well as individuals, governmental entities and not-for-profit enterprises throughout the United States and parts of Canada. CBIZ delivers its integrated services through the following three practice groups: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Financial Services 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Employee Services 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; National Practices 

CBIZ believes that its diverse and integrated service offerings result in advantages for both the client and for CBIZ. By providing custom solutions that help clients manage their finances and employees, CBIZ enables its clients to focus their resources on their own core business and operational competencies. Additionally, working with one provider for several solutions enables CBIZ&#146;s clients to utilize their resources more efficiently by eliminating the need to coordinate with multiple service providers. The ability to combine several services and offer them through one trusted provider distinguishes CBIZ from other service providers. 

Business Strategy 

CBIZ strives to maximize shareholder value and believes this is accomplished through growth in revenue and earnings per share, as well as the strategic allocation and deployment of free cash-flow and capital resources. 

Revenue 

CBIZ believes revenue growth will be achieved through internal organic growth, cross-serving additional services to its existing clients, and targeted acquisitions. Each of these components is critical to the long-term growth strategy, and CBIZ expects each component to contribute to long-term revenue growth. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; CBIZ believes it can capitalize on organic growth opportunities by offering a higher level of national resources than traditional local professional service firms, but delivering these services locally with a higher level of personal service than is expected from traditional national firms. CBIZ is also able to leverage technology to create efficiencies and to link together aligned services such as benefits, payroll and human resource services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cross-serving provides CBIZ with the opportunity to offer and deliver multiple services to existing clients. Cross-serving opportunities are identified by Company employees as they provide services to their existing clients. Being a trusted advisor to its clients provides CBIZ with the opportunity to identify the clients&#146; needs, while the diverse and integrated services offered by CBIZ allow the Company to provide solutions to satisfy these needs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; CBIZ&#146;s acquisition strategy is to selectively acquire businesses that expand the Company&#146;s market position and strengthen its existing service offerings. Strategic businesses that CBIZ seeks to acquire generally have strong and energetic leadership, a positive local market reputation, commitment to client service, the potential for cross-serving additional CBIZ services to their clients, an ability to integrate quickly with existing CBIZ operations and are accretive to earnings. 

&#160; 

Earnings Per Share 

CBIZ expects to grow earnings per share by increasing revenue and achieving operating leverage through improved productivity and cost management. 

Cash Flows and Capital Resources 

CBIZ&#146;s strategy is to utilize capital resources for strategic initiatives that will optimize shareholder return. The highest priority for the utilization of capital is focused on strategic acquisitions. CBIZ also believes that repurchasing shares of its common stock is a use of cash that provides stockholder value. Accordingly, CBIZ has historically adopted a repurchase plan annually and continually evaluates share repurchase opportunities. CBIZ may repurchase shares of its common stock when, after assessing capital needed to fund acquisitions and seasonal working capital needs, capital resources are available and such repurchases are accretive to stockholders. 

Business Services 

During the year ended December 31, 2013, CBIZ, through its subsidiary CBIZ Operations, Inc., an Ohio corporation, completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each of CBIZ Medical Management Professionals, Inc., an Ohio corporation, and CBIZ Medical Management, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and substantially all of the stock of their subsidiary companies, collectively consisting of all of CBIZ&#146;s Medical Management Professionals ongoing operations and business (&#147;MMP&#148;) to Zotec Partners, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company. Prior to the completion of this transaction, MMP was considered one of CBIZ&#146;s practice groups. For further discussion regarding MMP, see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Following the disposition of MMP, CBIZ delivers its integrated services through three operating practice groups. A general description of services provided by each practice group is provided in the table below.

&#160; &#160; 

A discussion of CBIZ&#146;s practice groups and certain external relationships and regulatory factors that currently impact those practice groups are provided below. See Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of CBIZ&#146;s practice groups. 

Financial Services 

The Financial Services practice group is divided into a Financial Services division, which represents the various accounting units spread geographically throughout the United States that provide core accounting services regionally, and a National Services division consisting of those units that provide their specialty services nationwide. Core accounting services consist mainly of accounting and tax compliance and consulting, as well as litigation support, while National Services consist primarily of federal and state governmental health care compliance, valuation services, real estate consulting and internal audit outsourcing. Both the Financial Services and National Services divisions report to the President of Financial Services. The President of Financial Services reports to CBIZ&#146;s President and Chief Operating Officer (&#147;COO&#148;). 

Restrictions imposed by independence requirements and state accountancy laws and regulations preclude CBIZ from rendering audit and attest services (other than internal audit services). As such, CBIZ and its subsidiaries maintain joint-referral relationships and administrative service agreements (&#147;ASAs&#148;) with independent licensed Certified Public Accounting (&#147;CPA&#148;) firms (the &#147;CPA firms&#148;) under which audit and attest services may be provided to CBIZ&#146;s clients by such CPA firms. These firms are owned by licensed CPAs, a vast majority of whom are also employed by CBIZ&#146;s subsidiaries. Under these ASAs, CBIZ provides a range of services to the CPA firms, including (but not limited to): administrative functions such as office management, bookkeeping and accounting; preparing marketing and promotional materials; providing office space, computer equipment and systems support; and leasing administrative and professional staff. Services are performed in exchange for a fee. 

Fees earned by CBIZ under the ASAs are recorded as revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and totaled approximately $137.5 million, $133.7 million and $133.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a majority of which is related to services rendered to privately-held clients and governmental agencies. In the event that accounts receivable and unbilled work in process become uncollectible by the CPA firms, the service fee due to CBIZ is typically reduced on a proportional basis. The ASAs have terms ranging up to eighteen years, are renewable upon agreement by both parties, and have certain rights of extension and termination. 

With respect to CPA firm clients that are required to file audited financial statements with the SEC, the SEC staff views CBIZ and the CPA firms with which CBIZ has contractual relationships as a single entity in applying independence rules established by the accountancy regulators and the SEC. Accordingly, CBIZ does not hold any financial interest in an SEC-reporting attest client of an associated CPA firm, enter into any business relationship with an SEC-reporting attest client that the CPA firm performing an audit could not maintain, or sell any non-audit services to an SEC-reporting attest client that the CPA firm performing an audit could not sell, under the auditor independence limitations set out in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other professional accountancy independence standards. Applicable professional standards generally permit CBIZ to provide additional services to privately-held companies in addition to those services which may be provided to SEC-reporting attest clients of an associated CPA firm. CBIZ and the CPA firms with which CBIZ is associated have implemented policies and procedures designed to enable the Company and the CPA firms to maintain independence and freedom from conflicts of interest in accordance with applicable standards. Given the policies set by CBIZ on its relationships with SEC-reporting attest clients of associated CPA firms, and the limited number and size of such clients, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act independence limitations do not, and are not expected to, materially affect CBIZ revenues. 

The CPA firms with which CBIZ maintains ASAs may operate as limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships or professional corporations. The firms are separate legal entities with separate governing bodies and officers. Neither the existence of the ASAs nor the providing of services thereunder constitutes control of the CPA firms by CBIZ. CBIZ and the CPA firms maintain their own respective liability and risk of loss in 

&#160; 

connection with the performance of their respective services. Attest services are not permitted to be performed by any individual or entity that is not licensed to do so. CBIZ is not permitted to perform audits, reviews, compilations, or other attest services, does not contract to perform them and does not provide the associated attest reports. Given this legal prohibition and course of conduct, CBIZ does not believe it is likely that it would bear the risk of litigation losses related to attest services provided by the CPA firms. 

At December 31, 2015, CBIZ maintained ASAs with four CPA firms. Most of the members and/or stockholders of the CPA firms are also CBIZ employees, and CBIZ renders services to the CPA firms as an independent contractor. One of CBIZ&#146;s ASAs is with Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C. (&#147;Mayer Hoffman&#148;), an independent national CPA firm headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Mayer Hoffman has 251 stockholders, a vast majority of whom are also employees of CBIZ. Mayer Hoffman maintains an eight member board of directors. There are no board members of Mayer Hoffman who hold senior officer positions at CBIZ. CBIZ&#146;s association with Mayer Hoffman offers clients access to the multi-state resources and expertise of a national CPA firm. CBIZ also has an ASA with Myers &#38; Stauffer LLC (&#147;M&#38;S&#148;), an independent national governmental health care consulting firm headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. M&#38;S has eight equity members, all of whom are also employees of CBIZ. M&#38;S maintains a three member executive committee, none of whom hold senior officer positions at CBIZ. 

Although the ASAs do not constitute control, CBIZ is one of the beneficiaries of the agreements and may bear certain economic risks. As such, the CPA firms with which CBIZ maintains ASAs qualify as variable interest entities. See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 

Employee Services 

CBIZ&#146;s Employee Services practice group operates under a divisional President who oversees the practice group, along with a senior management team aligned along functional, product, and unit management lines. The Employee Services President reports to CBIZ&#146;s President and COO. CBIZ&#146;s Employee Services group is organized along lines of services such as employee benefits consulting and brokerage, property and casualty brokerage, retirement plan advisory services, payroll services, human capital advisory services, actuarial services, life insurance and other services that serve local and regional clients with national resources. 

CBIZ&#146;s Employee Services practice group maintains relationships with many different insurance carriers. Some of these carriers have compensation arrangements with CBIZ whereby some portion of payments due may be contingent upon meeting certain performance goals, or upon CBIZ providing client services that would otherwise be provided by the carriers. These compensation arrangements are provided to CBIZ as a result of its performance and expertise, and may result in enhancing CBIZ&#146;s ability to access certain insurance markets and services on behalf of CBIZ clients. The aggregate compensation related to these arrangements received during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was less than 2% of consolidated CBIZ revenue for the respective periods. 

National Practices 

The National Practices group offers technology and health care consulting services. Both units within the National Practices group have a Business Unit President. One Business Unit President reports to a Senior Vice President and CBIZ&#146;s President and COO. The other Business Unit President reports to CBIZ&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;). 

Sales and Marketing 

CBIZ&#146;s branding goals are focused on providing CBIZ with a consistent image while at the same time providing support, tools and resources for each practice and market to utilize within each of the Company&#146;s distinct 

&#160; 

geographic and industry markets. Three key strategies are employed to accomplish these goals: (1) thought leadership, (2) market segmentation, and (3) sales/sales management process development. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Thought leadership : CBIZ marketing efforts continue to capitalize on the extensive knowledge and expertise of CBIZ associates. This has been accomplished through media visibility, social media, webinars, and the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Market segmentation : The majority of CBIZ marketing resources are devoted to the highly measurable and high return on investment strategies that specifically target those industries and service areas where CBIZ has particularly deep experience. These efforts typically involve local, regional or national trade show and event sponsorships, targeted direct mail, email, and telemarketing campaigns, and practice and industry specific websites and newsletters. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sales/sales management process development : CBIZ continues to enhance an accountable business development culture with several initiatives, including enhanced management visibility, analytics and forecasting through Salesforce.com and the implementation of performance management scorecards and business development pipeline reports. Together, these initiatives have helped create a more effective, efficient and successful sales management process throughout the Company. 

CBIZ&#146;s focus has been on developing marketing strategies that specifically support each of the Company&#146;s major practice areas: Financial Services (accounting) and Employee Services (insurance, payroll and human resources). In each of these segments, emphasis has been put on marketing technology that has the highest and most measurable return on investment, including enhanced targeted email campaigns, webinars, web lead generation, and an evolving web presence. 

In 2012, CBIZ launched an initiative to build relationships and reputation through social media. Beginning with comprehensive training and support for LinkedIn and Twitter, CBIZ&#146;s social media efforts have expanded to include programs on Facebook, Google+, YouTube and social sharing sites such as Slideshare and Pinterest. 

Clients 

CBIZ provides professional services to over 90,000 clients, including over 50,000 business clients. By providing various professional services and administrative functions, CBIZ enables its clients to focus their resources on their own operational competencies. Reducing administrative functions allows clients to enhance productivity, reduce costs and improve service quality and efficiency by focusing on their core business. Depending on a client&#146;s size and capabilities, it may choose to utilize one, some or many of the diverse and integrated services offered by CBIZ. 

CBIZ&#146;s clients come from a large variety of industries and markets, including many government agencies, with the Company targeting mid-sized companies that have between 100 and 2,000 employees and annual revenues between $5.0 million and $200.0 million. CBIZ&#146;s largest client, Edward Jones, comprised less than 3.0% of CBIZ&#146;s consolidated revenue in 2015 and is included in the National Practices operating practice group. Management believes that its client diversity helps insulate CBIZ from a downturn in a particular industry or geographic market. Nevertheless, economic conditions among select clients and groups of clients may have an impact on the demand for services provided by CBIZ. 

Competition 

The professional business services industry is highly fragmented and competitive, with a majority of industry participants, such as accounting, employee benefits, payroll providers or professional service organizations, offering only a limited number of services. Competition is based primarily on client relationships, quality of professional advice, range and quality of services or product offerings, customer service, timeliness, geographic 

&#160; 

proximity, and competitive rates. CBIZ competes with a number of multi-location regional or national professional services firms and a large number of relatively small independent firms in local markets. CBIZ&#146;s competitors in the professional business services industry include, but are not limited to, independent consulting services companies, independent accounting and tax firms, payroll service providers, independent insurance brokers and divisions of diversified services companies. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

CBIZ seeks to strengthen its operations and customer service capabilities by selectively acquiring businesses that expand its market position and strengthen its existing service offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CBIZ acquired substantially all of the assets of three businesses: 

First Quarter 2015 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Model Consulting, Inc. (&#147;Model&#148;), located in Trevose, Pennsylvania, effective March 1, 2015. Model provides employee benefit consulting services to mid-sized companies in the Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey markets. Annualized revenue attributable to Model is estimated to be approximately $4.2 million. Operating results attributable to Model are reported in the Employee Services practice group. 

Fourth Quarter 2015 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pension Resource Group, Inc. (&#147;PRG&#148;), located in Woodstock, Georgia, effective October 1, 2015. PRG provides pension administration solutions including defined benefit administration, data warehousing, benefit communication, compensation statement and human capital services to clients ranging in size from 500 to over 60,000 participants. Annualized revenue attributable to PRG is estimated to be approximately $4.8 million. Operating results attributable to PRG are reported in the Employees Services practice group. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cottonwood Group, Inc. (&#147;Cottonwood&#148;), located in Overland Park, Kansas, effective December 1, 2015. Cottonwood provides pension plan consulting, actuarial and investment services for institutional pension plans, retirement funds, endowment funds and foundations. Annualized revenue attributable to Cottonwood is estimated to be $3.1 million. Operating results attributable to Cottonwood are reported in the Employees Services practice group. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, CBIZ also purchased six client lists, all of which are reported in the Employee Services practice group. 

Discontinued Operations of MMP 

During the year ended December 31, 2013, CBIZ, through its subsidiary CBIZ Operations, Inc., an Ohio corporation, completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MMP to Zotec Partners, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company. Prior to the completion of this transaction, MMP was considered one of CBIZ&#146;s practice groups. For further discussion regarding MMP, see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Regulation 

CBIZ&#146;s operations are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and professional governing bodies. Accordingly, CBIZ&#146;s business services may be impacted by legislative changes by these bodies, particularly with respect to provisions relating to payroll, benefits administration and insurance services, pension plan administration and tax and accounting. CBIZ remains abreast of regulatory changes affecting its business, as these changes often affect clients&#146; activities with respect to employment, taxation, benefits, and accounting. For 

&#160; 

instance, changes in income, estate, or property tax laws may require additional consultation with clients subject to these changes to ensure their activities comply with revised regulations. 

CBIZ itself is subject to industry regulation and changes, including changes in laws, regulations, and codes of ethics governing its accounting, insurance, valuation, registered investment advisory and broker-dealer operations, as well as in other industries, the interpretation of which may impact CBIZ&#146;s operations. 

CBIZ is subject to certain privacy and information security laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, The Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and other provisions of federal and state laws which may restrict CBIZ&#146;s operations and give rise to expenses related to compliance. 

As a public company, CBIZ is subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to reform the oversight of public company auditing, improve the quality and transparency of financial reporting by those companies and strengthen the independence of auditors. 

As of December 31, 2015, CBIZ believes it is in compliance with all governmental and professional organizations regulations in which it provides services. 

Liability Insurance 

CBIZ carries insurance policies, including those for commercial general liability, automobile liability, property, crime, professional liability, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability, fiduciary liability, employment practices liability and workers&#146; compensation, subject to prescribed state mandates. Excess liability coverage is carried over the underlying limits provided by the commercial general liability, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability, professional liability and automobile liability policies. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, CBIZ employed approximately 4,400 employees. CBIZ believes that it has a good relationship with its employees. A large number of the Company&#146;s employees hold professional licenses or degrees. As a professional services company that differentiates itself from competitors through the quality and diversity of its service offerings, CBIZ believes that its employees are its most important asset. Accordingly, CBIZ strives to remain competitive as an employer while increasing the capabilities and performance of its employees. 

Seasonality 

A disproportionately large amount of CBIZ&#146;s revenue occurs in the first half of the year. This is due primarily to accounting and tax services provided by the Company&#146;s Financial Services practice group, which is subject to seasonality related to heavy volume in the first four months of the year. CBIZ&#146;s Financial Services practice group generated more than 40.0% of its revenue in the first four months of each of the past five years. In addition, more than 50.0% of the Company&#146;s annual earnings per share have been earned during the first quarter of each of the past five years. Like most professional service companies, most of CBIZ&#146;s operating costs are relatively fixed in the short term, which generally results in higher operating margins in the first half of the year.

CBIZ&#146;s principal executive office is located at 6050 Oak Tree Boulevard, South, Suite 500, Cleveland, Ohio 44131, and the Company&#146;s telephone number is (216) 447-9000.
