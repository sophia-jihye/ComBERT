Economic and Credit Turmoil from 2011 to 2015 

&#160;

As reported in the media, the recovery which followed the 2007 economic downturn appears to have been less robust than previous post recession recoveries. The Bank and, as a result, the Company, along with the rest of the financial services industry, have been impacted by the downward pressure on net interest margins caused by the lower interest rates due to steps taken by the Federal Reserve in managing the recovery. As further reported in the media, the Federal Reserve, having ended their aggressive Quantitative Easing program, is monitoring the rates of growth, unemployment, and inflation to which they expect the economy to converge over time in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary policy. Appropriate monetary policy, by definition, is aimed at achieving the Federal Reserve&#8217;s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability in the longer run. During December 2015, the Federal Reserve concluded the economy has shown considerable strength and decided to raise the Federal Funds rate, further stating that it anticipates the pace of tightening to be gradual. Despite these challenges, we realized net income of $1,352,616 for 2015. We have remained well capitalized through this difficult time without governmental assistance. We have continued to be actively engaged with the communities we serve, lending and meeting their needs. We believe that we are a sound, conservatively run financial institution that has remained profitable despite the deterioration in the economic environment and the outside forces that have affected us these past six years. 

&#160;

Market Area 

&#160;

The Bank considers its principal market area for lending and deposit products to consist of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Anne Arundel County includes mature suburbs of the City of Baltimore, which in recent years have experienced modest population growth and are characterized by an aging population. Management believes that the majority of the working population in its market area either commutes to Baltimore or is employed at businesses located at or around the nearby Baltimore Washington International Airport. Anne Arundel County is generally considered to have more affordable housing than other suburban Baltimore areas and attracts younger persons and minorities on this basis.

Lending Activities 

&#160;

The Bank offers a full range of consumer and commercial loans. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities include residential and commercial real estate loans, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, commercial loans and consumer installment lending including indirect automobile lending. Substantially all of the Bank&#8217;s loan customers are residents of Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of Central Maryland. The Bank solicits loan applications for commercial loans from small to medium sized businesses located in its market area. The Company believes that this is a market in which a relatively small community bank, like the Bank, has a competitive advantage in personal service and flexibility. The Bank&#8217;s consumer lending currently consists primarily of indirect automobile loans originated through arrangements with local dealers.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s total loan portfolio decreased in 2015 and increased during the 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 fiscal years. In 2015, the decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to decreases in indirect loans, purchase money mortgages and refinance mortgage loans with lesser decreases in other areas. These decreases were partially offset by increases in home equity loans and commercial and industrial loans with lesser increases in other areas. In 2015, mortgage participations sold also increased. In 2014, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, purchase money mortgage, and commercial and industrial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in refinance mortgage loans and commercial and industrial mortgages. In 2013, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, refinance mortgage loans, non-home owner residential construction loans, home equity and purchase money mortgages, partially offset by decreases in secured business installment loans, home-owner residential construction, commercial and industrial mortgages, and demand secured business loans. In 2012, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, commercial and industrial mortgages, home equity and purchase money mortgages, partially offset by decreases in refinance mortgage loans, construction loans for commercial and industrial loans and demand secured business loans. In 2012, mortgage participations purchased also decreased. In 2011, the increase in the loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in indirect loans, residential mortgages, and installment loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial mortgages. In 2011, mortgage participations purchased decreased but so did mortgage participations sold.

Real Estate Lending. The Bank offers long-term mortgage financing for residential and commercial real estate as well as shorter term construction and land development loans. Residential mortgage and residential construction loans are originated with fixed rates, while commercial mortgages may be originated on either a fixed or variable rate basis. Commercial construction loans may be originated on either a fixed or a variable rate basis. Substantially all of the Bank&#8217;s real estate loans are secured by properties in Anne Arundel County, Maryland . Under the Bank&#8217;s loan policies, the maximum permissible loan-to-value ratio for owner-occupied residential mortgages is 80% of the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value. For residential investment properties, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80%. The maximum permissible loan-to-value ratio for residential and residential construction loans is 80%. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for permanent commercial mortgages is 75%. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for land development loans is 70% and for unimproved land is 65%. The Bank also offers home equity loans secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence, provided that the aggregate indebtedness on the property does not exceed 80% of its value. Because mortgage lending decisions are based on conservative lending policies, the Company has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub-prime residential mortgage market.

&#160;

Commercial Lending. The Bank&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio consists of demand, installment and time loans for commercial purposes. The Bank&#8217;s business demand, installment and time lending includes various working capital loans, equipment, vehicles, lines of credit and letters of credit for commercial customers. Demand loans require the payment of interest until called, while installment loans require a monthly payment of principal and interest, and time loans require at maturity a single payment of principal and interest due monthly. Such loans may be made on a secured or an unsecured basis. All such loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness rather than the value of the collateral.

&#160;

Installment Lending. The Bank makes consumer and commercial installment loans for the purchase of automobiles, boats, other consumer durable goods, capital goods and equipment. Such loans provide for repayment in regular installments and are secured by the goods financed. Also included in installment loans are other types of credit repayable in installments. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 60.60% of the installment loans in the Bank&#8217;s portfolio (other than indirect automobile lending) had been originated for commercial purposes and 39.40% had been originated for consumer purposes.

&#160;

Indirect Automobile Lending. The Bank commenced its indirect automobile lending program in January 1998. The Bank finances new and used automobiles for terms of up to 75 months. The Bank will lend a maximum of 110% of invoice on new vehicles. On used vehicles, the Bank will not lend more than 120% of the clean wholesale value as published in a nationally recognized used vehicle pricing guide. The Bank requires all borrowers to obtain vendor&#8217;s single interest coverage protecting the Bank against loss in the case a borrower&#8217;s automobile insurance lapses. The Bank originates indirect loans through a network of approximately 60 dealers which are primarily new car dealers located in Anne Arundel County and the surrounding counties. Participating dealers take loan applications from their customers and transmit them to the Bank for approval.

&#160;

Personal Unsecured Lines. The Bank offers overdraft protection lines of credit, tied to checking accounts, as a convenience to qualified customers.

&#160;

Although the risk of non-payment for any reason exists with respect to all loans, certain other specific risks are associated with each type of loan. The primary risks associated with commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, are the quality of the borrower&#8217;s management and a number of economic and other factors which induce business failures and depreciate the value of business assets pledged to secure the loan, including competition, insufficient capital, product obsolescence, changes in the borrowers&#8217; cost, environmental hazards, weather, changes in laws and regulations and general changes in the marketplace. Primary risks associated with residential real estate loans include fluctuating land and property values and rising interest rates with respect to fixed-rate, long-term loans. Residential construction lending exposes the Company to risks related to builder performance. Consumer loans, including indirect automobile loans, are affected primarily by domestic economic instability and a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower&#8217;s unemployment, including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy. Because the Bank deals with borrowers through an intermediary on indirect automobile loans, this form of lending potentially carries greater risks of defects in the application process for which claims may be made against the Bank. Indirect automobile lending may also involve the Bank in consumer disputes under state &#8220;lemon&#8221; or other laws. The Bank seeks to control these risks by following strict underwriting and documentation guidelines. In addition, dealerships are contractually obligated to indemnify the Bank for such losses for a limited period of time.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s lending activities are conducted pursuant to written policies approved by the Board of Directors intended to ensure proper management of credit risk. Loans are subject to a well defined credit process that includes credit evaluation of borrowers, establishment of lending limits and application of lending procedures, including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances, as well as procedures for on-going identification and management of credit deterioration. Regular portfolio reviews are performed by the Bank&#8217;s Senior Credit Officer to identify potential underperforming loans and other credit facilities, estimate loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the Bank&#8217;s policies. On a quarterly basis, the Bank&#8217;s Internal Auditor performs, or causes to be performed, an independent loan review in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s loan review policy. For significant problem loans, management review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and any guarantor, the related collateral, and the effects of economic conditions.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s loan approval policy provides for various levels of individual lending authority. The maximum aggregate lending authority granted by the Bank to any one Lending Officer is $750,000. A combination of approvals from certain officers may be used to lend up to an aggregate of $1,000,000. The Bank&#8217;s Executive Committee is authorized to approve loans up to $3.0 million. Larger loans must be approved by the full Board of Directors.

&#160;

Under Maryland law, the maximum amount which the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and their related interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include the Bank&#8217;s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 50% of its allowance for possible loan losses. Under this authority, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $3.58 million to any one borrower at December 31, 2015. By interpretive ruling of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be permissible for a national bank which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank&#8217;s total capital for regulatory capital purposes plus any loan loss allowances not included in regulatory capital). Under this formula, the Bank was permitted to lend up to $5.52 million to any one borrower from and after January 1, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the largest amount of exposure to any one borrower and its related interests was $5,005,000. From and after January 1, 2016, the Bank is permitted to lend up to $5.60 million to any one borrower.

&#160;

Non-Performing Loans 

&#160;

It is the policy of The Bank that any loan that is ninety (90) days or more delinquent in the payment of principal and/or interest be placed into non-accrual status. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, if it is determined that there appears to be a substantial amount of risk of not collecting all of the agreed upon interest that would normally accrue to a loan, the loan is placed into Non-Accrual status even if the determination is made prior to ninety (90) days delinquent. A variance to this rule would be if the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection. An asset is &#8220;well secured&#8221; if it is secured by (1) collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is &#8220;in the process of collection&#8221; if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in prepayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future.

&#160;

The Bank seeks to control delinquencies through diligent collection efforts. For consumer loans, the Bank sends out payment reminders on the seventh and twelfth days after a payment is due. If a consumer loan becomes 15 days past due, the account is transferred to the Bank&#8217;s collections department, which will contact the borrower by telephone and/or letter before the account becomes 30 days past due. If a consumer loan becomes more than 30 days past due, the Bank will continue its collection efforts and will move to repossession or foreclosure by the 45th day if the Bank has reason to believe that the collateral may be in jeopardy or the borrower has failed to respond to prior communications. The Bank may move to repossess or foreclose in all instances in which a consumer loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. After repossession of a motor vehicle, the borrower has a 15-day statutory right to redeem the vehicle and is entitled to 10 days&#8217; notice before the sale of a repossessed vehicle. The Bank sells the vehicle as promptly as feasible after the expiration of these periods. If the amount realized from the sale of the vehicle is less than the loan amount, the Bank may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. The Bank follows similar collection procedures with respect to commercial loans.

The Bank experienced an increase in the total of non-accrual and past due loans, as management has taken an aggressive approach to bring these assets to resolution. The increase in non-accrual loans is predominately attributed to one residential real estate investor, which consists of four borrowers and ten loans, with a carrying value of $1.7 million. The following table sets forth the amount of the Bank&#8217;s restructured loans, non-accrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due at the dates indicated:

For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest of $239,038 would have been accrued on non-accrual loans if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms. During that period, interest on non-accrual loans was not included in income. $3,243,954, or 85.82%, of the Bank&#8217;s total $3,779,749 non-accrual loans at December 31, 2015 were attributable to 14 borrowers. Two of these borrowers were in bankruptcy at that date. Because of the legal protections afforded to borrowers in bankruptcy, collections on such loans are difficult and the Bank anticipates that such loans may remain delinquent for an extended period of time.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, there were loans outstanding, totaling $1,107,665, not reflected in the above table as to which known information about the borrower&#8217;s possible credit problems caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms. These loans consist of loans which were not 90 days or more past due but where the borrower is in bankruptcy or has a history of delinquency or the loan to value ratio is considered excessive due to deterioration of the collateral or other factors.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had $74,400 in real estate acquired in partial or total satisfaction of debt, compared to $45,000 and $1,171,000 in such properties at each of December 31, 2014 and 2013. This increase for 2015 was the result of one property with a value of $45,000 being sold and two properties, with one owner, being added in 2015. This decrease for 2014 was the result of $91,000 being written off on three properties and four properties with a value of $1,154,000 being sold. One property was added to OREO in 2014. All such properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value at the date acquired and carried on the balance sheet as other real estate owned. Losses arising at the date of acquisition are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent write-downs that may be required and expense of operation are included in non-interest expense. Gains and losses realized from the sale of other real estate owned are included in non-interest income or expense. For a description of the properties comprising other real estate owned at December 31, 2015, see &#8220;Item 2. &#8212; Properties.&#8221;

&#160;

Allowance For Credit Losses 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s allowance for credit losses is based on the probable estimated losses that may be sustained in its loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting. (1) ASC Topic 450, &#8220;Accounting for Contingencies&#8221;, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and (2) ASC Topic 310, &#8220;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan&#8221;, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.

&#160;

The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The allowance, based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience, is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, value of collateral, and current economic conditions and trends that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay. Because mortgage lending decisions are based on conservative lending policies, the Company has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub-prime residential mortgage market.

&#160;

In 2015, the Bank increased its provision for credit losses primarily due to the increases in net charge-offs during the year. There were two residential real estate investors that contributed greatly towards the need for additional provision for credit losses. One of these projects was resolved during the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a charge-off of $645,000 and the remaining real estate investor has significant specific reserves allocated to their ten loans which are in non-accrual status. The Bank utilizes a model to calculate the required reserves for potential losses that is based on historical loss factors/ratios. Thus, when the Bank experiences an increase in net charge-offs the historical loss ratios increase causing additional provisions to be required.

Investment Securities 

&#160;

The Bank maintains a substantial portfolio of investment securities to provide liquidity as well as a source of earnings. The Bank&#8217;s investment securities portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies including mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions, and corporate trust preferred securities. The tax treatment of the Bank&#8217;s portfolio of securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions allows the Company to use the full tax advantage of this portfolio.

&#160;

The following table presents at amortized cost the composition of the investment portfolio by major category at the dates indicated.

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had no investments in securities of a single issuer (other than the U.S. Government securities and securities of federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises), which aggregated more than 10% of stockholders&#8217; equity.

&#160;

Deposits And Other Sources of Funds 

&#160;

The funds needed by the Bank to make loans are primarily generated by deposit accounts solicited from the communities surrounding its branches in Anne Arundel County. Consolidated total deposits were $335,191,530 as of December 31, 2015. The Bank uses borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of Atlanta to supplement funding from deposits. The Bank was permitted to borrow up to $71.82 million under a line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Deposits. The Bank&#8217;s deposit products include regular savings accounts (statements), money market deposit accounts, demand deposit accounts, NOW checking accounts, IRA and SEP accounts, Christmas Club accounts and certificates of deposit. Variations in service charges, terms and interest rates are used to target specific markets. Ancillary products and services for deposit customers include safe deposit boxes, money orders, night depositories, automated clearinghouse transactions, wire transfers, ATMs, telephone banking, and internet banking. The Bank is a member of the Cirrus(R), Star(R), Pulse(R) and MoneyPass(R) ATM networks.

&#160;

As stated above, the Bank obtains deposits principally through its network of branch offices. The Bank does not solicit brokered deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had approximately $51.53 million in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $100,000 or more, including IRA accounts. The following table provides information as to the maturity of all time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; &#160; (In Thousands) &#160; Three months or less &#160; $ 6,269 &#160; Over three through six months &#160; &#160; 3,870 &#160; Over six through 12 months &#160; &#160; 6,424 &#160; Over 12 months &#160; &#160; 34,965 &#160; Total &#160; $ 51,528 &#160; &#160; 

Borrowings. In addition to deposits, the Bank from time to time obtains advances from the FHLB of Atlanta of which it is a member. FHLB of Atlanta advances may be used to provide funds for residential housing finance, for small business lending, and to meet specific and anticipated needs. The Bank may draw on a $71.82 million line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta, which is secured by a floating lien on the Bank&#8217;s residential first mortgage loans. There was also a $10 million convertible advance with a 3.28% rate of interest (callable monthly and with a final maturity of November 1, 2017.) There was a $5 million convertible advance settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rate of interest and was callable quarterly, starting July 23, 2009. There was a $5 million convertible advance taken out August 22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly, starting August 22, 2011. The Bank also has three federal funds lines of credit in the amounts of $3 million, $5 million and $8 million, of which nothing was outstanding at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Bank faces competition for deposits and loans from other community banks, branches or affiliates of larger banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions, which compete vigorously (currently, sixteen FDIC-insured depository institutions operate within two miles of the Bank&#8217;s headquarters). With respect to indirect lending, the Bank faces competition from other banks and the financing arms of automobile manufacturers. The Bank competes in this area by offering competitive rates and responsive service to dealers.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s interest rates, loan and deposit terms, and offered products and services are impacted, to a large extent, by such competition. The Bank attempts to provide superior service within its community and to know, and facilitate services, to, its customers. It seeks commercial relationships with small to medium size businesses, which the Bank believes would welcome personal service and flexibility. The bank believes its greatest competition comes from larger intra- and inter-state financial institutions.

&#160;

Other Activities 

&#160;

The Company also owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of GBB Properties, Inc. (&#8220;GBB&#8221;), another Maryland corporation which was organized in 1994 and which is engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and disposing of real property, typically acquired in connection with foreclosure proceedings (or deeds in lieu of foreclosure) instituted by the Bank or acquired in connection with branch expansions by the Bank.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had 93 full-time equivalent employees. Neither the Company nor GBB currently has any employees.

&#160;

Regulation of the Company 

&#160;

General. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;). As such, the Company is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;) and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve Board annual and quarterly reports of its operations at the end of each period and to furnish such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Company is also subject to regular inspection by Federal Reserve Board examiners.

&#160;

Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before: (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.

&#160;

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Riegle-Neal Act&#8221;) authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to approve an application of an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company&#8217;s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Federal Reserve Board may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state. The Riegle-Neal Act also prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from approving such an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank&#8217;s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. The Riegle-Neal Act does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the Riegle-Neal Act. Under Maryland law, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any bank if the bank holding company would control more than 30% of the total deposits of all depository institutions in the State of Maryland unless waived by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks opted out of the Riegle-Neal Act by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act and prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. The State of Maryland did not pass such a law during this period. Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above.

&#160;

The BHCA also prohibits, with certain exceptions, a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s prior approval of specific nonbanking activities, the Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company.

&#160;

Effective with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;G-L-B Act&#8221;) on November 12, 1999, bank holding companies whose financial institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed and have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act records can elect to become &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; which will be permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than are currently permitted to bank holding companies. Financial holding companies are authorized to engage in, directly or indirectly, financial activities. A financial activity is an activity that is: (i) financial in nature; (ii) incidental to an activity that is financial in nature; or (iii) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The G-L-B Act includes a list of activities that are deemed to be financial in nature. Other activities also may be decided by the Federal Reserve Board to be financial in nature or incidental thereto if they meet specified criteria. A financial holding company that intends to engage in a new activity to acquire a company to engage in such an activity is required to give prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board. If the activity is not either specified in the G-L-B Act as being a financial activity or one that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by rule or regulation to be financial in nature, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required.

&#160;

The Maryland Financial Institutions Code prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock of a bank or bank holding company without the approval of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation except as otherwise expressly permitted by federal law or in certain other limited situations. The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring voting stock in a bank or bank holding company without 60 days&#8217; prior notice to the Commissioner if such acquisition will give the person control of 25% or more of the voting stock of the bank or bank holding company or will affect the power to direct or to cause the direction of the policy or management of the bank or bank holding company. Any doubt whether the stock acquisition will affect the power to direct or cause the direction of policy or management shall be resolved in favor of reporting to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution. Voting stock acquired in violation of this statute may not be voted for five years.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See &#8220;Regulation of the Bank &#8212; Capital Adequacy.&#8221;

&#160;

Dividends and Distributions. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Bank holding companies whose capital ratios exceed the thresholds for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; banks on a consolidated basis are exempt from the foregoing requirement if they were rated composite 1 or 2 in their most recent inspection and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.

&#160;

Regulation of the Bank 

&#160;

General. As a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC but which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (a &#8220;state non-member bank&#8221;), the Bank is subject to the supervision of the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation and the FDIC. The Commissioner and FDIC regularly examine the operations of the Bank, including but not limited to capital adequacy, reserves, loans, investments and management practices. These examinations are for the protection of the Bank&#8217;s depositors and not its stockholders. In addition, the Bank is required to furnish quarterly and annual call reports to the Commissioner and FDIC. The FDIC&#8217;s enforcement authority includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the legal maximum of $250,000 for each insured depositor. Some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the Bank that are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC include reserve requirements and disclosure requirements in connection with personal and mortgage loans and savings deposit accounts. In addition, the Bank is subject to numerous Federal and state laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches, investments, interest rates on loans, credit practices, the disclosure of customer information, the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions.

&#160; 

Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;), includes provisions pertaining to domestic security, surveillance procedures, border protection, and terrorism laws to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Title III of the Patriot Act entitled, &#8220;International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001&#8221; includes amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act which expand the responsibilities of financial institutions in regard to anti-money laundering activities with particular emphasis upon international money laundering and terrorism financing activities through designated correspondent and private banking accounts.

&#160;

Section 313(a) of the Patriot Act prohibits any insured financial institution such as the Bank, from providing correspondent accounts to foreign banks which do not have a physical presence in any country (designated as &#8220;shell banks&#8221;), subject to certain exceptions for regulated affiliates of foreign banks. Section 313(a) also requires financial institutions to take reasonable steps to ensure that foreign bank correspondent accounts are not being used to indirectly provide banking services to foreign shell banks, and Section 319(b) requires financial institutions to maintain records of the owners and agent for service of process of any such foreign banks with whom correspondent accounts have been established.

&#160;

Section 312 of the Patriot Act creates a requirement for special due diligence for correspondent accounts and private banking accounts. Under Section 312, each financial institution that establishes, maintains, administers, or manages a private banking account or a correspondent account in the United States for a non-United States person, including a foreign individual visiting the United States, or a representative of a non-United States person shall establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, enhanced, due diligence policies, procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and record instances of money laundering through those accounts.

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are not currently aware of any account relationships between the Bank and any foreign bank or other person or entity as described above under Sections 313(a) or 312 of the Patriot Act.

&#160;

Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, governments worldwide have enacted and tightened regulations which can assist in fighting terrorism. It is reasonable to anticipate that the United States Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to combat terrorism including modifications to existing laws such as the Patriot Act to expand powers as deemed necessary. The enactment of the Patriot Act has increased the Bank&#8217;s compliance costs, and the impact of any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions is uncertain. However, such legislation would likely increase compliance costs and thereby potentially have an adverse effect upon the Company&#8217;s results of operations.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. &#160; Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) regulations evaluate banks&#8217; lending to low and moderate income individuals and businesses across a four-point scale from &#8220;outstanding&#8221; to &#8220;substantial noncompliance,&#8221; and are a factor in regulatory review of applications to merge, establish new branch offices or form bank holding companies. In addition, any bank rated in &#8220;substantial noncompliance&#8221; with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings. The Bank has a current rating of &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; for CRA compliance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies and state non-member banks, respectively. The regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to &#8220;risk-weighted&#8221; assets.

&#160;

The regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC require bank holding companies and state non-member banks, respectively, to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of &#8220;Tier 1 capital&#8221; (as defined in the risk-based capital guidelines discussed in the following paragraphs) to total assets of 3.0%. Although setting a minimum 3.0% leverage ratio, the capital regulations state that only the strongest bank holding companies and banks, with composite examination ratings of 1 under the rating system used by the Federal bank regulators, would be permitted to operate at or near such minimum level of capital. All other bank holding companies and banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the minimum ratio, depending on the assessment of an individual organization&#8217;s capital adequacy by its primary regulator. Any bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital well above the minimum levels. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that whenever appropriate, and in particular when a bank holding company is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks, it will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the level of an organization&#8217;s ratio of tangible Tier 1 capital (after deducting all intangibles) to total assets in making an overall assessment of capital.

&#160;

The risk-based capital rules of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC require bank holding companies and state non-member banks, respectively, to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels based upon a weighting of their assets and off-balance sheet obligations according to risk. Risk-based capital is composed of two elements: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists primarily of common stockholders&#8217; equity, certain perpetual preferred stock (which must be noncumulative in the case of banks), and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; less all intangible assets, except for certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. Tier 2 capital elements include, subject to certain limitations, the allowance for losses on loans and leases; perpetual preferred stock that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital and long-term preferred stock with an original maturity of at least 20 years from issuance; hybrid capital instruments, including perpetual debt and mandatory convertible securities; and subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock.

&#160;

The risk-based capital regulations assign balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet obligations to one of four broad risk categories based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor. The assets and off-balance sheet items in the four risk categories are weighted at 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%. These computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. The risk-based capital regulations require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to total risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least 4% as Tier 1 capital. For the purpose of calculating these ratios: (i) Tier 2 capital is limited to no more than 100% of Tier 1 capital; and (ii) the aggregate amount of certain types of Tier 2 capital is limited. In addition, the risk-based capital regulations limit the allowance for loan losses includable as capital to 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets.

&#160;

FDIC regulations and guidelines additionally specify that state non-member banks with significant exposure to declines in the economic value of their capital due to changes in interest rates may be required to maintain higher risk-based capital ratios. The Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have proposed a system for measuring and assessing the exposure of a bank&#8217;s net economic value to changes in interest rates. The Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have stated their intention to propose a rule establishing an explicit capital charge for interest rate risk based upon the level of a bank&#8217;s measured interest rate risk exposure after more experience has been gained with the proposed measurement process. Federal Reserve Board regulations do not specifically take into account interest rate risk in measuring the capital adequacy of bank holding companies.

&#160;

The FDIC has issued regulations which classify state non-member banks by capital levels and which authorize the FDIC to take various prompt corrective actions to resolve the problems of any bank that fails to satisfy the capital standards. Under such regulations, a well-capitalized bank is one that is not subject to any regulatory order or directive to meet any specific capital level and that has or exceeds the following capital levels: a total risk-based capital ratio of 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a leverage ratio of 5%. An adequately capitalized bank is one that does not qualify as well-capitalized but meets or exceeds the following capital requirements: a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4%, and a leverage ratio of either (i) 4% or (ii) 3% if the bank has the highest composite examination rating. A bank not meeting these criteria is treated as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized depending on the extent to which the bank&#8217;s capital levels are below these standards. A state non-member bank that falls within any of the three undercapitalized categories established by the prompt corrective action regulation will be subject to severe regulatory sanctions. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was well capitalized as defined by the FDIC&#8217;s regulations.

&#160;

&#160;

Branching. Maryland law provides that, with the approval of the Commissioner, Maryland banks may establish branches within the State of Maryland without geographic restriction and may establish branches in other states by any means permitted by the laws of such state or by federal law. The Riegle-Neal Act authorizes the FDIC to approve interstate branching de novo by state banks, only in states that specifically allow for such branching.

&#160;

Dividend Limitations. Pursuant to the Maryland Financial Institutions Code, Maryland banks may only pay dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. The Maryland Financial Institutions Code further restricts the payment of dividends by prohibiting a Maryland bank from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus fund equals the amount of required capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, in an amount in excess of 90% of net earnings. In addition, the Bank is prohibited by federal statute from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution that would cause the Bank to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements. Further, the FDIC also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a state non-member bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. The Bank is required to pay semi-annual assessments based on a percentage of its insured deposits to the FDIC for insurance of its deposits by the Bank Insurance Fund (&#8220;BIF&#8221;). Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC is required to set semi-annual assessments for BIF-insured institutions to maintain the designated reserve ratio of the BIF at 1.25% of estimated insured deposits or at a higher percentage of estimated insured deposits that the FDIC determines to be justified for that year by circumstances raising a significant risk of substantial future losses to the BIF.

&#160;

Under the risk-based deposit insurance assessment system adopted by the FDIC, the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the FDIC, which is determined by the institution&#8217;s capital level and supervisory evaluations. Based on the data reported to regulators for the date closest to the last day of the seventh month preceding the semi-annual assessment period, institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups &#8212; &#8220;well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized.&#8221; Within each capital group, institutions are assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution&#8217;s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the FDIC determines to be relevant to the institution&#8217;s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund. Under the current assessment schedule, well-capitalized banks with the best supervisory ratings are not required to pay any premium for deposit insurance. All BIF-insured banks, however, will be required to begin paying an assessment to the FDIC in an amount equal to 2.12 basis points times their assessable deposits to help fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency established by the federal government to finance takeovers of insolvent thrifts.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates. A state non-member bank or its subsidiaries may not engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate in an amount greater than 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and for all such transactions with all affiliates a state non-member bank is limited to an amount equal to 20% of capital stock and surplus. All such transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions. An affiliate of a state non-member bank is any company or entity which controls or is under common control with the state non-member bank and, for purposes of the aggregate limit on transactions with affiliates, any subsidiary that would be deemed a financial subsidiary of a national bank. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a state non-member bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the state non-member bank. The BHCA further prohibits a depository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution, subject to certain limited exceptions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Stockholders. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state non-member bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the Bank unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not favor insiders. Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus . Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $100,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000) must be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any &#8220;interested&#8221; director not participating in the voting. State non-member banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors. In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.
