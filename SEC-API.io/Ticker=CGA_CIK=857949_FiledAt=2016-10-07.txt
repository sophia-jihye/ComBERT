 Item 1. Business &#160; 

We, the Company, are primarily engaged in the research, development, production and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;) through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiaries, Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), our VIE, Yuxing (agricultural products production), and another six VIE companies that we newly acquired in June 2016. Our primary business is of fertilizer products, specifically humic acid-based compound fertilizer produced through Jinong; and compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, highly-concentrated water-soluble fertilizers and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer produced through Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce agricultural products, such as top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings.

&#160; 

On June 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Jinong, entered into strategic acquisition agreements and a series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of the following six companies that are organized under the laws of the PRC and would be deemed as variable interest entities (the &#8220;VIEs&#8221;): Shaanxi Lishijie Agrochemical Co., Ltd., Songyuan Jinyangguang Sannong Service Co., Ltd., Shenqiu County Zhenbai Agriculture Co., Ltd., Weinan City Linwei District Wangtian Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., Aksu Xindeguo Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., and Xinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (collectively hereafter referred to as &#8220;the VIE Companies.&#8221;) 

&#160;

Fertilizer production was our core business and we generated approximately $260,378,357, $259,030,774, and $229,917,266, or 96.9%, 98.4 % and 98.4% of our total revenues for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our total annual production capacity was 555,000 metric tons as of June 30, 2016.

As of June 30, 2016, we sold our products through a network of 1,904 regional distributors covering 27 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 3 central government-controlled municipalities in China. We do not rely on any single distributor. Our top five distributors accounted for an approximately 40% of our fertilizer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, of which Sino-agri Holding Company Limited accounted for 23.3% of the total fertilizer revenues. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we developed 688 different fertilizer products. We conduct our research and development activities through Yuxing, Jinong&#8217;s VIE, which tests new fertilizers and grow high quality flowers, vegetables and seedlings for commercial sale.

(1) The exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars on June 30, 2016 is RMB1=US$0.1508, according to the exchange rate published by Bank of China. &#160; 

Pursuant to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of the Targets, while be in possession of the equity interests and will continue to be the legal owners of such interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof but excluding any claims or encumbrances, and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange of an aggregated amount of RMB37,000,000 (approximately $5,579,600) to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA, ACN and the VIE Agreements, and convertible notes with an aggregated face value of RMB51,000,000 (approximately $7,690,800) with an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3% and term of three years. 

The SAA contains representations and warranties by both Jinong and the shareholders of the Targets including: 

Should the shareholders of the Targets fail to satisfy the conditions listed in the exhibit to the SAA, i.e., the entry into the VIE Agreements, as defined below or are in breach of any representations or warranties in the SAA, other than the direct and consequential damages that may cause to Jinong, they shall pay RMB100,000 (approximately $15,080) as a breach make up. 

The shareholders of the Targets agree and ensure its main management members and technology persons to agree and enter into Non-Compete Agreements which shall prohibit any direct or indirect operation, holding of equity interests of the same or similar business of the Targets, its customers or suppliers, unless the operation of such an entity is through the Targets. 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The equity interests of the Targets do not have any form of Claims or Encumbrances, as such terms are defined in the SAA. The shareholders of the Targets represented that there is no action, suit, arbitration, or legal proceeding pending or, currently threatened against the Targets that would have a material adverse effect on the Target&#8217;s capacity to fulfill their contractual obligations. The Targets shall have a minimum of 10% of annual compound growth rate (the &#8220;Growth Rate&#8221;) within the three (3) years after the closing of the Strategic Acquisitions (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;). 

&#160; 

According to the SAA, all the existing employees will continue to be the employees of the Targets after the Closing based on the current employment terms, subject to the decisions from the new board of the Targets to be formed after the Closing. 

&#160;

Under the ACN, each convertible note (or note, as referred to below) has a face value of RMB100 with a term of three years and an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3%. The convertible notes take priority over the preferred stock and common stock of Jinong, and any other class or series of capital stocks Jinong issues in the future in terms of interests and payments in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Jinong. On or after the third anniversary of the issuance date of the note (the &#8220;Mature Date&#8221;), noteholders may request Jinong to process the note conversion through mechanics of conversion chosen by Jinong. The noteholder shall not have Jinong convert the note prior to the Mature Date and Jinong may decline the conversion if the noteholder requests so. If the note is converted into the Company&#8217;s common stock, the noteholder will become the holders of the Company&#8217;s common stock.

&#160;

The per share conversion price of the note is the higher of the following: (i) $5.00 per share or (ii) 75% of the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the date the noteholder delivers the conversion notice.

&#160;

If the profits of the Targets hit certain level of sales target set by the parties, i.e., the Growth Rate, Jinong may at its discretion, convert the notes to (i) cash , (ii) the Company&#8217;s common stock, or (iii) to a combination of cash and the Company&#8217;s common stock, in the amount of the face value of the notes with compound interest for three years.

&#160; 

Upon the arrival of the Mature Date of the note, the noteholder can (i) requests Jinong to convert all or a part of the note; (ii) continue to hold the note until such a holder delivers a conversion request at his/her will; however, if the holder chooses to hold the note after the Mature Date, no interests shall accrue on the note after the three year term. 

&#160; 

In the event that the behavior of the Targets or noteholders materially impair Jinong or, if the annual compounded rate for sales within the three years following the acquisition of any of the Targets by Jinong fail to achieve the sales target listed in the SAA, or the Growth Rate, Jinong may request noteholders to redeem the shares they hold of the Targets with (i) amount represented by the convertible notes including the accrued interests and the cash payment Jinong made on the Closing of the Strategic Acquisition and (ii) 15% of the amount under (i) mentioned immediately prior to this item. However, the noteholder can elect to offset the payment of the interests of the note by the annual increase rate the Targets realizes, despite a lower rate. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Jinong acquired the Targets using the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory requirements under the PRC laws.

&#160;

As our business focuses on the production of fertilizer, all of our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry in China. Specifically, we deal with compliance, regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farm land use and transfer, growing and distribution of agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of grains. It is an industry in which heavy regulations get implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, E-commerce, which is also under strict government regulations in the PRC, has lately become a sale and distribution channel for agricultural products. Currently, we are developing an online platform to connect the physical distribution network we either own or lease.

&#160;

Compared with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions, the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies promulgated the Regulation on Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (the &#8220;M&#38;A Rules&#8221;), which became effective on September 8, 2006. The &#8220;M&#38;A Rules&#8221; purports to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals and formed for purposes of overseas listing through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &#8220;CSRC&#8221;) prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&#8217;s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. However, the CSRC has not issued any definitive rules or interpretations concerning whether offerings such as the Offering are subject to the CSRC approval procedures under the M&#38;A Rules. Based on our understanding of the PRC Laws (including the M&#38;A Rules), a prior approval from the CSRC is not required for the Offering because (1) the Company established its first foreign invested enterprise in 1999, prior to the adoption of M&#38;A Rules; (2) the Company did not acquire any equity interests or assets of a PRC company owned by its controlling shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC companies or individuals, as such terms are defined under the M&#38;A Rules. However, uncertainties still exist as to how the M&#38;A Rule will be interpreted and implemented and our opinion stated above is subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&#38;A Rule.

&#160;

For both E-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set particularly rules for foreign-owned entities to conduct business. We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in E-commerce and agriculture industries. VIE arrangement, however, provides feasibility for the purpose of obtaining administrative approval process and avoiding industry restrictions that be imposed on an entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign entity. The VIE agreements reduces uncertainty and the current limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well as the control we obtained through VIE arrangement, are valid and enforceable. Such legal structure does not violate the known, published, and current PRC laws. While there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign ownership ca be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement. Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity pledge agreements provide legal protection for the control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed the equity pledge processes with the Targets to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Targets. The shareholders of the Targets are not entitled to transfer any shares to the third party under the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to our company without consideration.

&#160;

While the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility to conduct our business in the E-Commerce and agriculture industries, validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors&#8217; rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting creditors&#8217; rights, (iii) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and enforceability of contractual rights generally under concepts of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and applicable statutes of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution or implementation of any legal documents that would be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercionary at the conclusions thereof; and (v) judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorney&#8217;s fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process. Validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is also subject to risk derived from the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there can no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retrospective effect.

&#160; Industry Analysis 

&#160; 

Fertilizer Market in China 

&#160; 

Influenced by the sluggish demand in domestic and international fertilizer market, China&#8217;s fertilizer market is in downturn during this year. In terms of production, the output of fertilizer will reach another record high during the Fiscal Year 2016. However, large inventory of fertilizer guarantee no profits. The prices of raw material move down, so the price of fertilizer is hard to rise; in terms of domestic consumption, though grain price increased to some extent, the domestic consumption capacity is limited; as for export, international market is depressed continuously resulted from the declined export price. In this year, fertilizer industry is in downward trend as the profit is compressed again and the losses of enterprises are enlarged. Under the pressure of sluggish growth in fertilizer market, industrial restructuring, mergers and reorganization were frequently conducted in the industry, hence the number of enterprises continued to decline. At the same time, the production equipment and technological level was largely improved: coal-water slurry gasification technology, powdered coal pressure gasification technology, large sulfur-based compound fertilizer technology and beneficiation technology of mid-low grade phosphorite were widely used, while new fertilizer products such as slow controlled release fertilizer and microbial fertilizer has been rapidly developed and resulted in significant market expansion. 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Recently, as the growth of China&#8217;s economy has gradually slowed down and the risk of economic downturn therefore exists, the government has adopted various measures to maintain the growth and the Company needs structural adjustment and growth pattern transformation. 

&#160;

On the one hand, government&#8217;s support to agricultural production includes intensive agricultural investment, subsidies and minimum purchasing price raise for farm products. China has seen another bumper year of grain production, making 2013 the 10 th year in a row of increase output, which supports fertilizer scale to remain high in 2016. The country has achieved 10 consecutive year of rising grain harvests since the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in 1949. As the concentration of fertilizer industry is steadily improving, the influence on market from key enterprises have increased which helped to ease the weakened market volatility. On the other hand, the current oversupply problem is hard to relieve. Mechanism of Price reform for raw materials (such as coal, natural gas, sulfur phosphate ore, etc.) is accelerating, which casted pressure on production cost. Stricter export tariff policy is expected to last for long, and weak external economical situation may limit the operation and expansion of fertilizer enterprises in international market. 

&#160;

The interaction of the above factors complicated the situation in fertilizer market in 2016.The overall growth rate of this industry has continually slowed down and the market has fluctuated violently. The transformation for China&#8217;s fertilizer industry from quantitative growth pattern to qualitative growth pattern is irreversible. The centralization of production, high-end orientated product, service orientated marketing and market-oriented raw materials dominated the development in fertilizer market. 

&#160; 

Additionally, government support for the agriculture industry in China would act as an additional boost to the fertilizer industry in China. However, we anticipate organic fertilizers will become an emerging segment in the coming years given the additional subsidies for farming, elimination of certain land taxes, land reform initiatives to be implemented by the PRC government to promote the growing of organic produce. We believe the demand for fertilizer will continue to grow as a result of increase in food demand, decrease in arable land and reduction of crop yields. The demand for fertilizers nationwide is expected to reach thousands of tons of nutrient by 2017, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% between 2012-2017.

&#160;

Organic versus Chemical Fertilizers 

&#160; 

In general, fertilizer products are categorized into organic and chemical fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can be natural or developed artificially. Natural organic fertilizers include manure, slurry, worm castings, peat, seaweed, humic acid, brassin and guano. Artificial organic fertilizers include compost, blood meal, bone meal, humic acid, and are typically supplemented with other nutrient ingredients. Chemical fertilizers normally are composed of synthetic chemicals such as phosphate and potassium compounds. The primary difference between organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers is in the sourcing process of ingredients as the nutrient contents are largely the same. 

&#160; 

Over the past 20 years, the use of chemical fertilizers in China substantially increased, but years of use created unintended consequences for the agriculture industry&#8212;Agricultural products gradually lack certain minerals since Chemical fertilizers applied fell short of natural minerals which made soil infertile. 

&#160; 

In addition, heavy use of chemical fertilizers would create &#34;fertilizer burn&#34;, the over-fertilization of a single nutrient such as nitrogen. which dried roots and suspend crop growth due to the upset of balance in compound salts and soil acidification. Another drawback caused by chemical fertilizers is that soil are easily depleted by irrigation, rainfall and flooding. In addition, the production of chemical fertilizers consumed a great deal of natural resources. For example, the production of synthetic ammonia, a common chemical fertilizer, consumes about 5% among the world&#8217;s natural gas consumption. 

&#160; 

Organic fertilizers, on the other hand, improve the biodiversity and long-term productivity of soil. Organic nutrients increase the abundance of soil organisms by providing organic micronutrients. Unlike chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizer nutrients are diluted with better solubility. It requires less application on soil to reach the same result as of chemical fertilizers, which maintains soil fertility and avoid the runoff caused by components like soluble nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the composition of organic fertilizer is more complex and costly than chemical products. As an alternative to pure chemical fertilizer use, farmers can also use inorganic fertilizer supplemented with small portion of organic fertilizers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Since the 1980s, China has intensified the use of chemical fertilizers in order to increase crop yields. While the increase in crop yield slowed down in recent years, the overuse of chemical fertilizers also caused many environmental issues ranging from water pollution to soil damage. As a result, the PRC government has been promoting the use of environmental friendly green fertilizers, such as humic acid-based organic compound fertilizers and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizers, because they provide crops with incremental yield by adding various nutrients essential to soil. Although being relatively new to farmers, the demand for these green fertilizers was increasing and we expect this trend to continue in the coming years. Among other Asian and Southeast Asian countries we expanded business to, the PRC remained our principal market for organic compound fertilizers and related agricultural products. 

&#160; 

The &#8220;Green Food&#8221; Industry in the PRC 

&#160; 

The rise of the PRC industry for food free from pollutants or harmful chemicals, or &#8220;green food&#8221;, raise the demand for organic fertilizers. &#8220;Green Food&#8221;, the certificate for agricultural products promoted by Chinese Government, positioned between ordinary agricultural food from common farming practice and the organic food has two levels: &#8220;AA Green Food&#8221; and &#8220;A Green Food&#8221;. The &#8220;AA Green Food&#8221; standard indicates or equals to that of organic agriculture. Since the market for organic agricultural products in China has huge potential, it is forecasted that the increase of organic agricultural products consumption in China will exceed that of the average organic agricultural products consumption in the world in the next few years, and the market of Chinese organic agricultural products will reach RMB 24.8 billion-59.4 billion in 2015with an incremental 15 percent increase year over year during the next following years. 

&#160; 

With the rapid development of organic food industry in China, an increasing number of companies have been entering into the green food sector to utilize market opportunities. In 1990, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture began to promote the production of green food; In 1992, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture established the China Green Food Development Center ( CGFDC) to supervise the development and management of green food at the national and provincial levels in the PRC; In 1993, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture established regulations for green food labeling; In 1996, a trademark for green food was registered and put into use in the PRC. 

&#160; 

Crops grown with the use of our products are qualified for &#8220;AA Green Food&#8221; certificate. As mentioned above, the &#8220;AA&#8221; rating indicates that the crops contain minimal chemical residue from fertilizers. Although our products are not qualified for the &#8220;AA Green Food&#8221; certificate, they are (except for the products from &#8220;Gufeng&#8221;) certified as &#8220;Green Food Production Material&#8221; by the CGFDC. 

&#160; 

According to the statistics from the CGFDC, China's annual output of green food reached 15 million tons in 2008. However, the domestic consumption level remains relatively low, comprising approximately 3% of the market share of food commodities. The low consumption level is primarily due to: (i) small scale of production of green food; (ii) lack of consumer awareness of green food and (iii) the presence of counterfeit green food products that adversely affect consumers&#8217; purchase. 

&#160; 

As described by the CGFDC, the development strategy for China&#8217;s green food industry are as follows: first, maintain high quality standards and focus on developing key products; second, promote and facilitate the industrialization of green food; third, implement an integrated development strategy emphasizing producers, production base and farmers; fourth, accelerate the pace of development with the aid of the government; and fifth, to carry out an international development strategy aimed at promoting exports. 

&#160; 

According to the Investment and Forecast Report on China Green Food Industry 2012-2016 by Research in China, a Chinese market research company, the green food industry is a high growth industry with significant investment potential. According to the report, leading green food producers will experience huge growth when they achieve national and provincial agricultural industrialization with the supports of favorable government policies and tax breaks.

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe that our increased production capacity and our research and development capability positioned us to benefit from the anticipated growth of the PRC fertilizer market. We expect to expand sales and grow revenues through the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#9744; Expand Capacity and Diversify Product Offerings. Our current annual fertilizer production capacity is 555,000 metric tons and our portfolio of fertilizers includes 459 products. In the future we will expand our existing production lines, develop new products and acquire certain PRC fertilizer manufacturers that complement our product lines. 

&#160; 

&#9744; Capitalize on Synergies Created by Research and Development Efforts. In connection with the construction of Yuxing&#8217;s research and development center, we have established 98 sunlight greenhouses and six &#8220;intelligent&#8221; greenhouses. We expect the Yuxing facility to help us shorten the fertilizer market cycle by providing an advanced testing field for new products which are manufactured by Jinong. In addition, by making efforts in research and development, we expect to simultaneously facilitate the production of superior agricultural products, such as flower bulbs, flowers, fruits and vegetables, which would eventually increase revenues. 

&#160; 

&#9744; Develop new advanced high efficient fertilizers . The new fertilizer products represented by slow controlled-release fertilizer, microbial fertilizer and others, developed rapidly with high market expansion. Gufeng has signed a cooperation agreement with Anhui Diyuan Biological Technology Co., LTD (&#8220;Anhui Diyuan&#8221;) to produce the &#8220;Tianjuyuan&#8221; controlled-release fertilizer. The objective is to provide Gufeng with fertilizer agent supplied by Anhui Diyuan to improve the control release effectiveness when producing controlled-release compound fertilizers. In the agreement, Chinese Academy of Sciences (&#8220;CAS&#8221;) and Anhui Diyuan authorized Gufeng to refer to CAS and Anhui Diyuan&#8217;s name in marketing related fertilizer products. We expect that Gufeng&#8217;s controlled-release compound fertilizer will stay an advantageous position in the market. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our principal products are our fertilizers, which consist of liquid, granular and powdered fertilizers and various kinds of compound fertilizers developed to increase crop yields. We manufacture and sell 459 fertilizer products from humic acid-based fertilizers to compound fertilizers. In addition, we produce high quality agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables and flowers for commercial sale. 

&#160; 

Fertilizer Products 

&#160; 

Fertilizer business is our main business, which produce approximately 96.9% of total revenues. Fertilizers are produced and sale through Jinong and Gufeng. We believe that Jinong utilizes one of the most advanced automated humic acid production lines in China. Humic acid is a complex with natural, organic ingredient essential to make soil fertile. Humic acid-rich material, such as peat, lignite or weathered coal generating naturally from decomposed plant or animal remains, is one of the major organic constituents for soil composition. Humic acid exhibits a high capacity for cation exchange (a chemical process in which cations of like charge are exchanged equally between a solid and a solution), which serves to chelate plant nutrient elements and release them as the plant requires. The chelation process prevents leaching of nutrients by holding them in the soil solution. Moreover, humic acids can bind soil toxins along with plant nutrients, thereby strongly stabilize soil. The regular use of humic acid organic liquid compound fertilizer can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizer, insecticide, herbicide and water. This mechanism contributes to environmental protection by preventing contamination of water sources caused by runoff. 

&#160; 

In nature, humic acid improves soil structure and aeration, nutrient absorption and water retention. It also increases soil&#8217;s buffering capacity against fluctuations in PH levels, and reduces soil crusting and erosion from wind and water as well as radical toxic pollutants. Humic acid promotes the developing of root systems, seed germination and overall plant growth. It also enhances health, resilience and overall appearance of plants. We believe there is no synthetic material currently known to match humic acid's effectiveness and versatility. 

&#160; 

The pure humic acid used in our fertilizers is distilled and extracted from weathered coal by way of alkaline digestion and acid recrystallization. Our Jinong fertilizers are principally used as a foliar fertilizer (a liquid, water soluble fertilizer applied to a plant&#8217;s foliage by a fine spray so the plant absorbs the nutrients through its leaves), through spraying directly on soil or injecting into the irrigation systems. Benefits of using our products are to stimulate the growth and yield of plants, protecting them from drought, disease and temperature damages while improving soil structure and fertility. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Gufeng and Tianjuyuan produce compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, highly-concentrated water-soluble fertilizers and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer. Gufeng sells its products under four brands: &#8220;KEBA&#8221;, &#8220;Mei Er An&#8221;, &#8220;Huang Cheng Gen&#8221; and &#8220;SPR HOP&#8221;, which are all registered trademarks in the PRC. Tianjuyuan&#8217;s products are marketed under the brands &#8220;AGR GFJ&#8221; and &#8220;T.J.Y.&#8221; which are both PRC registered trademarks. 

&#160; 

We have a multi-tiered product line of 459 fertilizer products, covering humic acid-based compound fertilizer produced through Jinong, and organic/inorganic compound fertilizer through Gufeng. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we earned $260,378,357, $259,030,774 and $229,717,266, respectively, in gross revenues from sales of our fertilizer products, representing 96.9%, 98.4% and 98.4% of our total revenues for such periods. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan manufacture a total of 332 fertilizer products. 89.6% of Gufeng&#8217;s fertilizer revenue came from humic acid compound fertilizers and 10.4% from compound fertilizer for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Agricultural Products 

&#160; 

Our subsidiary, Yuxing, Jinong&#8217;s VIE produce top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings for commercial sale. The gross revenues from the sale of our agricultural products for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $8,406,663, $4,323,514 and $3,684,822, respectively, representing 1.6%, 1.6% or 1.6% of our total revenues, respectively. 

&#160; 

Yuxing was originally established to be the research and development base for humic acid fertilizers produced by Jinong. By simulating the growing conditions and cycles of various plants, such as flowers, vegetables and seedlings, Yuxing regularly conducts experimental testing to enhance the efficacy of our new fertilizers. 

&#160; 

Fertilizer Manufacturing Process 

&#160; 

Our production lines employ scientifically-designed production procedures and strict quality control systems to ensure high quality in our products. These production lines are fully automated and ran by a central control system with minimal manual input by technicians. The machinery and vats for the line are supplied by a local medical machinery manufacturer and the automatic control systems were developed by us. Our access management system protects the proprietary ingredient mixes from any unauthorized use at all time. Our computer server is connected to the electronic scales on each of the material input bins to ensure that the exact quantity of each elements or ingredients is delivered correctly, thus maintain product quality and reduce waste. Our production line producing liquid fertilizer and powered fertilizer is centrally controlled by a wireless panoramic audio and video monitoring system that allows connectivity with mobile terminals such as cell phones. 

&#160; 

In Jinong, we operate a 6,495 square meters (69,911 square feet) production facility that manufactures liquid fertilizer products and a 13,803 square meter (148,576 square feet) production facility that produces liquid and highly concentrated (powdered) fertilizers. Jinong&#8217;s total annual production capacity of these facilities is 55,000 metric tons. 

&#160; 

In Gufeng and Tianjuyuan, we operate eight manufacturing facilities located in No. 6 Mafang Logistics Park, Pinggu, Beijing. These facilities produce various kinds of fertilizers and have a total annual production capacity of 500,000 metric tons. 

&#160; 

The manufacturing techniques utilized by Gufeng include extruder granulation, rotary drum steam granulation, urea-based spraying granulation and resin-coated sustained release, which enable Gufeng to effectively meet the production requirements of all different compound fertilizers. To ensure high quality, Gufeng and Tianjuyuan employ strict quality controls from the raw materials purchases to the products sales to end users. 

&#160; 

We produced and sold a total of approximately 413,633 metric tons of fertilizer products during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

Fertilizer Products 

&#160; 

Among the three materials utilized to produce humic acid (weathered coal, lignite and peat), we have chosen weathered coal as our principal raw material because it is abundant with the price of approximately $116.1 per metric ton including delivery. We have been using Inner Mongolia Tianlibao Fertilizer Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianlibao&#8221;) as our main supplier for the abundant and high-quality weathered coal in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. We do not have any purchase volume commitment pursuant to our supply agreement with Tianlibao, which is renewable on a monthly basis. 

&#160; 

In addition to weathered coal, we also use approximately 50 different components in our production process, including elements such as sodium, calcium, zinc, iron and potassium, all of which can be readily obtained from local markets. We utilize spectral analysis technology to select raw materials with the best quality, and we have specially-trained buyers to ensure the consistency of raw materials procured. 

&#160; 

The fertilizer products that Gufeng and Tianjuyuan manufacture incorporate over 50 different raw materials, including coal, sulfuric acid and NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) related compounds such as amide and hydro nitrogen. Shaanxi Shanbei Agricluture Co., Ltd.. and Sino-agri are the primary suppliers for raw materials to Gufeng, accounting for approximately 29.1% and 26.8%, respectively, of Gufeng&#8217;s total purchase for the fiscal year end June 30, 2016. However, the loss of either of these suppliers would not cast a material adverse effect on our business. We do not believe there is any material risk of losing these suppliers during the next 12 months. 

&#160; 

Our products are packaged in bottles, bags and boxes. Each type of packaging material, along with packaging labels, is readily available for purchase from manufacturers in Shaanxi, Beijing, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces. 

&#160; 

Agricultural Products 

&#160; 

The plants that generate our top-grade flowers and multi-colored seedlings are mainly planted and cultivated in research and development facilities maintained by Yuxing. We purchase seeds of green vegetables and fruits from agricultural companies, such as RijkZwaan Company which imports the seeds from foreign markets including Holland. We cultivate our agricultural products by applying fertilizers produced by Jinong. 

&#160; 

Inventory 

&#160; 

For our fertilizer products, our efficient production methods allow us to maintain low inventory levels, which keep inventory costs down. We purchase raw materials and packaging materials based on real demands. Products are shipped directly to distributors after production in response to orders we received. We normally carry finished goods up to one week and do not maintain any work-in-process. 

&#160; 

For our agricultural products, we maintain approximately one month&#8217;s inventory because we need a significant amount of agricultural products to serve as our product testing base for research and development purpose. 

&#160; 

Return Policy 

&#160; 

The Company only accepts returns of defective fertilizer products. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not experience any significant returns. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had a backlog of orders in the amount of $9,664,348 as compared to $9,413,250, $5,359,200, and $1,009,062 in backlog orders as of June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The peak season to sell fertilizer products was from January through June. However, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, Jinong did not experience seasonal variation with respect to its fertilizer sales since approximately 47.5% of its annual sales revenue occurred in the third fiscal quarter (winter) and the fourth fiscal quarter (spring). Gufeng&#8217;s sales of compound fertilizer has undergone significant seasonal variation in China. Correspondingly, the purchase of its raw material, basic fertilizers, is affected by the supply and demand in the fertilizer market with seasonality. Over non-peak sales season, when the raw material price is low, Gufeng still places larger orders for raw material as its export business offset the seasonality when exportation made to southern Asia, such as India, where their selling are on corresponds to the non-peak season in China. 

&#160; 

The peak selling season for our agricultural products is from October till March the next calendar year, namely our second fiscal quarter (fall) and the third fiscal quarter (winter). This was primarily due to the strong demand for high-end fruits and decorative flowers during the holiday seasons. However, Yuxing did not have seasonal variation problem during the period from October 2015 through March 2016, it generated approximately 5.3 million, or 63.7% of our annual sales of agricultural products. 

Marketing, Distribution and Customers 

Overview 

We currently market our fertilizer products to private wholesalers and retailers of agricultural farm products in 27 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 3 central government-controlled municipalities in China. For the fiscal year 2016, the following five PRC provinces, collectively accounted for 56.3% of our total fertilizer revenue: Beijing(24.1%), Hebei (11.9%), Shaanxi (8.4%), Heilongjiang (6.8%) and Liaoning (5.0%). We believe this geographically diverse distribution greatly helps us to become a leader in the compound fertilizer market as compared to regional competitors because we are not heavily dependent on any single geographic area for sales and are able to raise our brand and product awareness nationwide. We also manufacture our fertilizer products for exportation through contracted distributors in foreign countries, including India and Ghana. Total revenues from exported products accounted for approximately 0.1% of our total fertilizer revenues in fiscal 2016.

Our agricultural products are distributed through various channels in Shaanxi Province and other provinces. Decorative flowers are usually sold through our fertilizer distributors to end-users such as flower shops, luxury hotels and government agencies. Fruits and vegetables are sold to high-end supermarkets and upscale restaurants. Seedlings are sold primarily to departments of city planning. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A multi-tiered product strategy allows us to tailor our fertilizer products to the needs and preferences of the various geographic regions in China. Our fertilizers can be tailored to different crops grown in varying climate and soil conditions. For example, climate and rainfall conditions in Southern and Eastern China allow farmers to grow high margin crops such as fruit and seasonal vegetables. As a result, these farmers are willing to invest in expensive and specialized fertilizers. In contrast, we market low-cost fertilizers to farmers in the Northwest areas of China due to the inclement weather. 

&#160; 

Our research and development capabilities allows us to tailor products to meet specific farming needs in considering different factors such as crops species, humidity, weather and soil conditions. 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing staff is trained to closely work with distributors and customers, including retailers and farmers, providing professional advice on customizing our products to customer needs and offering agricultural knowledge and other extensive customer support. In addition, our employees educate and communicate with distributors and customers by regularly organizing training courses on new agricultural techniques. 

&#160; 

Compared with industry norms, we believe our product development cycle of three to nine months is relatively short. Through our regular collection of market data, including growth records of a variety of plants cultivated in different soil and climate conditions, together with feedbacks from our end-users, we are able to conduct nationwide market analysis, ascertain new product needs, estimate demand and customer demographics and develop new products tailored to current market needs. 

&#160; 

Although we utilize television advertisements and mass media, the majority of our marketing efforts are conducted through joint activities with distributors. Our sales and marketing staff works with and trains distributors and retail clients through lectures and interactive meetings. We emphasize the technological components of our products to end-users to help them understand the differences in products and how to effectively use them. Word-of-mouth advertising and sample trials of new products in new areas are also essential components of our marketing efforts. In addition, we have established nationwide telephone hotlines to answer questions and have constructed an SMS text message platform to have real-time interaction with customers. 

&#160;

Fertilizer Products 

The fertilizer product market in China is highly fragmented. Our primary sales strategy is to establish contractual relationships with qualified distributors throughout the country, who, in turn, will distribute our products to wholesalers and retailers, and ultimately, the farmers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we sold our products through a carefully constructed network of about 1,904 distributors covering 27 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 3 central government-controlled municipalities in China. 

The distributors sell our products to the smaller, local wholesale and retail outlets who then sell to the end-users, typically farmers. We do not grant provincial or regional exclusivity because there is currently no single distributor sufficiently dominant to warrant exclusivity. We enter into non-exclusive written distribution agreements with chosen distributors that demonstrate their ability in regional sales networks. The distribution agreements do not dictate distribution quantity because changes in weather and local market could dramatically affect sales quotas. 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, sales to our top five distributors accounted for approximately 38.5% of our fertilizer product revenue, of which Sino-agri Holding Company Limited accounted for 23.7% of the total fertilizer revenues. As we do not depend on any particular customers, we believe that the loss of single customers would not have any significant effect on our business. 

Agricultural Products 

We distribute our agricultural products through several networks depending on the type of product. Our top-grade flowers are mainly distributed through our fertilizer distribution network; Our green vegetables and fruits are mainly distributed to a variety of wholesale markets and supermarkets in Xi&#8217;an, while our multi-colored seedlings are distributed to the seedling centers and planting companies in China with which we have had long-term cooperation. The following is a list of our top five customers in terms of revenues for our agricultural products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Yuxing&#8217;s customers accounted for approximately 29.7% of the total revenues from Yuxing&#8217;s agricultural products. 

&#160; 

Retail Stores and Authorized Retailers 

We have successfully implemented two marketing programs in Shaanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu and Guangzhou provinces. These marketing programs consist of: (i) establishment of Company directly-owned retail stores to sell fertilizer products produced by Jinong and Gufeng through the designated sales personnel (the &#8220;Pilot Program&#8221;) and (ii) selection of qualified retailers from the Company's distributor base to be designated as &#34;China Green Agriculture Authorized Retailers&#34;. Under the Pilot Program, we currently have one directly-owned store operating in Shaanxi Province, with each store having an assigned territory in order not to compete with other existing distributors. Since the launch of the Pilot Program in January 2010, we have worked closely with our existing distributors who designate over 26,175 retailers, namely the &#8220;China Green Agriculture Retailers&#8221; for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We have entered into agreements with these retailers to prominently display &#34;China Green Agriculture Authorized Retailer&#34; on their exhibits, and have well-positioned standardized shelf and product displays in their retail stores. In addition, we provide the retailers with educational materials on proper product use and billboard ads with our product logo to attract target farmers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

We conduct the bulk of our research and development activities through Yuxing. Through Yuxing, we cultivate high-quality flowers, green vegetables and fruits in our own greenhouses and sell them to various end-users, including airlines, hotels and restaurants. Yuxing operates advanced research and development facilities that: (i) provide testing and an experimental data collection base for new fertilizers produced by Jinong by simulating the growing conditions and development stages of a variety of plants, such as flowers, vegetables and seedlings, (ii) increase our capability to produce more products while shortening the new product development cycle, which allows us to release products to market quickly, thus increasing revenues and market share. In addition, our research and development capabilities allow us to develop products tailored to specific farming needs generated by different crop species, humidity, weather and soil conditions. Flowers, fruits and vegetables grown from experimental testing of Jinong&#8217;shumic acid compound fertilizers are of high quality and are sold to local supermarkets and airline companies. 

The capital expenditure and other payments on Yuxing&#8217;s construction were approximately $13,300,313, $474,322 and $927,153 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon completion, we expect the research and development center to help expanding our output of high quality agricultural products for commercial sale while providing an advanced testing field for new products. The new facility will continue to enhance our capability to produce more products while shortening the development cycle, thus increase revenues and market share. In addition to developing new humic acid-based fertilizer products, we plan to develop other agricultural derivatives such as humic-acid based organic pesticides, which can provide additional revenue sources. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we sold approximately $8,406,663 of these agricultural products.

The PRC Patent Law was adopted by the PRC National People's Congress in 1984 and was subsequently amended in 1992 and 2000. Under the PRC Patent Law, an invention patent is valid for a term of 20 years and a utility or design patent is valid for a term of 10 years. Both of our registered patents are all utility patents. Any use of our patent without consent or a proper license from the us constitutes an infringement of patent rights. 

&#160; 

In addition to trademark and patent protection in China, we also rely on contractual confidentiality provisions to protect our brand and intellectual property rights. To safeguard these rights our research and development personnel and executive officers are subject to confidentiality agreements. They are also subject to a non-compete covenant following the termination of employment. They also agree that all work products belong to us. Moreover, we take steps to limit the number of personnel involved in the production process and, instead of disclosing fertilizer ingredients to employees, we refer to the ingredients by numbers. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe our products possess the following competitive advantages which enable us to compete in the PRC fertilizer market. 

&#160; 

Nation-wide sales network . In the highly fragmented Chinese fertilizer market, we have established our own distribution channels with private distributors that sell our products to retail stores and farmers throughout China. We have over 1,292 distributors nationwide across 27 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 3 central government-controlled municipalities in China. Most of our competitors do not have a sales team as large as ours that specializes in the sale of compound fertilizer products. Moreover, we believe the regional strengths of Gufeng&#8217;s distribution network have expanded and will continue to expand our sales coverage to certain cities and counties as well as foreign markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Strong Research and Development . Our research and development is managed effectively. Typically, it takes only three to nine months from the decision to develop a new product to mass production, which ensures product flow and helps to maintain market share. Our strong research and development department is based on our intelligent greenhouse facilities. The advanced equipment and soil-free techniques in such facilities simulate the natural environment in different areas and control selected factors. Since most of Jinong&#8217;s experimental work is conducted in Yuxing&#8217;s greenhouse facilities, thereby speeding up development cycles, we are able to reduce costs without sacrificing accurate results. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we generated approximately $8,406,663 revenue from sales of Yuxing&#8217;s agricultural products, and we anticipate that this source of revenue will grow in the future. We have built 98 sunlight greenhouses and six intelligence greenhouses over an 88-acre parcel of land in connection with Yuxing's pending research and development center, which expands output of high quality agricultural products for commercial sale while providing an advanced testing field for new products. 

&#160; 

Gufeng and Tianjuyuan have a total of 17 employees in research and development. They have independently developed seven technologies: 

&#160; 

(1) Drying fan for urea-based compound fertilizer; 

&#160; 

(2) Heat balance control system for flexible compound fertilizer; 

&#160; 

(3) Automatic control system for the anti-block of compound fertilizer; 

&#160; 

(4) Water control technology for low nitrogen, low potassium and high phosphorus compound fertilizer; 

&#160; 

(5) Manufacturing technology for salt-alkaline resistance and soil improvement of compound fertilizer(The company had won the third prize for &#8220;Progress in Science and Technology in Pinggu District Beijing&#8221; with this technology); 

&#160; 

(6) Manufacturing technology for compound HA fertilizer with high density (NPK &#8805; 51%); 

&#160; 

(7) Manufacturing technology for the sustained release of blending and compound fertilizer 

&#160; 

While we believe our greenhouse facilities provide us with a competitive advantage over the competitors, some of them may still have better understanding in certain local markets where they successfully marketed products over a period of time and have developed specifically formulated fertilizers for local plants, soil and climate conditions. To enhance our competitiveness, we will seek to diversify our fertilizers to benefit a wider range of plants and soil conditions. 

&#160; 

Well-known Brand. We believe customers have strong brand recognition and would make purchase decision accordingly. &#8220;Jinong&#8221;, &#8220;KEBA&#8221; and &#8220;T.J.Y&#8221; are registered trademarks and are well recognized by end users; in addition, certain large national fertilizer traders, such as Sinoagri Holding Company Limited, one of the largest domestic fertilizer traders in China, had strong brand preference for Gufeng&#8217;s fertilizer products. Gufeng sells its products under four brands, namely &#8220;KEBA&#8221;, &#8220;Meier&#8217;an&#8221;, &#8220;Huangchenggen&#8221; and &#8220;SPR HOP&#8221;. Tianjuyuan&#8217;s products are marketed under the brands &#8220;AGR GFJ&#8221; and &#8220;T.J.Y.&#8221; The primary products sold under the Gufeng and Tianjuyuan brands include orgainc/inorganic compound fertilizer (humic acid) with NPK &#8805; 40%, and organic /inorganic compound fertilizer (humic acid) with NPK &#8805; 48%. 

&#160; 

Automated Production Line and Process . All of Jinong&#8217;s major production procedures are controlled by a centralized computer system only accessible for authorized personnel. Jinong&#8217;s production lines are fully automated to ensure that content in each product is measured exactly according to its recipe by linking the computer server with the electronic weights on each material input bins. In addition, spectral analysis is used to accurately check the composition of materials. During the fiscal year 2016, Jinong&#8217;s highly advanced production lines manufactured a multi-tiered line of 132 fertilizer products, and we believe that Jinong&#8217;s production lines are among the few advanced lines in the Chinese industry. As mentioned above, we have patent protection for Jinong&#8217;s two proprietary production lines, one of which has medical grade production equipment with precise quality control, and the other is capable of producing liquid, powder and granular fertilizers. We currently have an annual production capacity of 555,000 metric tons.

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Fertilizer Products 

&#160; 

Based on our internal estimates, there are approximately 2,000 organic fertilizer manufacturers in China with no discernible market leaders in the sector. We believe our competitors are currently comprised of approximately 90% small-sized local manufacturers and 10% large national manufacturers such as Yongye International, Inc. We believe we are among the largest national fertilizer manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Gufeng&#8217;s primary competitor is Stanley Fertilizer Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Stanley&#8221;), a compound fertilizer manufacturer based in Linyi, Shandong Province, which was listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange (China) in June 2011. Stanley manufactures various kinds of compound fertilizers and tailored fertilizers which were in direct compete with Gufeng. 

&#160; 

The smaller competitors of ours are generally producers of amino acid compound fertilizers which are very price competitive. However, lacking of adequate quality or process control technologies, these companies always sell products with inconsistent quality. 

&#160; 

The Chinese fertilizer market has been fully opened to foreign companies since China&#8217;s entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2006. Accordingly, the PRC government has increased its fertilizer import quota and, since January 2007, has reduced the import tariffs on foreign fertilizer to 1%. However, foreign fertilizers are generally more expensive than PRC manufactured fertilizers and are not customized to soil conditions influenced by China&#8217;s diverse climate and terrains. 

&#160; 

Agricultural Products 

&#160; 

The competitive market of our agriculture products varies among our three main products: Top-grade flowers, green vegetables and fruits, multi-colored seedlings. 

&#160; 

Top-grade Flowers : The main competitor to our flowers and flower seedlings is Sanyi Agriculture Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing). We believe that our flower products have comparative advantages in terms of the advanced technologies we apply, the superior species of the seedlings we select and the efficiency and stability due to strict quality control. In addition, our greenhouse facilities enable us to produce flower seedlings year-round. 

&#160; 

Green Vegetables and Fruits : Our competitors are primarily the vegetable planting centers and planters in Shaanxi, Shandong and Gansu provinces that produce vegetables such as cucumbers and peppers. With the aid from our green fertilizers that improve soil conditions and limit bacterial growth, our competitive advantage lies in the advanced greenhouse facilities which contribute to the pollution-free end products. 

&#160; 

Multi-colored Seedlings : In the market of Multi-colored seedlings, one of our main competitors is Kunming Anthura horticulture Co. Ltd. Our products, primarily red photiniaserrulata, are imported from other countries with high survival rates. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business operations are subject to various laws, including environmental, health and workplace safety laws issued by governmental agencies on the provincial and state levels. Business and company registrations, along with the products, are monitored through the issuance of licenses and certificates including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8220;Green&#8221; Certification . Except for those manufactured by Gufeng and Tianjuyuan, all of our fertilizer products are certified by the CGFDC as &#8220;Green Food Production Material&#8221;. Currently, the CGFDC provides two different certifications within the green food industry: &#34;Green Food Certification&#34; granted to edible foods, and &#34;Green Food Production Material Certification&#34; granted to production materials such as our fertilizers. A &#8220;Green Food Production Material Certification&#8221; was issued to Jinong on March 2015 and will expire in March 2018. The certificate is renewable with an application within 90 days prior to the expiration.

&#160;

Operating license. Our operating license enables us to (1) undertake research and development, production, sales and services of humic-acid liquid fertilizer, (2) sales of pesticides, and (3) export and import of products, technology and equipment. Jinong&#8217;s license (Registration No. 610000100003655) is valid until August 8, 2057, and the license is renewable. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan maintain valid operating licenses with expiration day on August 1, 2043 (for the license with Registration No. 110000008250498) and August 7, 2021 (for the license with Registration No.110117003157142), respectively.

&#160;

Fertilizer Registration. Fertilizer registration is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the PRC and is required for producing fertilizers. There are two kinds of registrations: interim registration and formal registration. The interim registration is valid for one year and applies to fertilizers in the stages of in-the-field testing and test selling; Fertilizers that have completed in-the-field testing and test selling must obtain formal registration, which, if granted, is valid for five years, and thereafter must be renewed every five years. Jinong currently holds 16 formal fertilizer registration certificates. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan hold 11 interim fertilizer certificates and 259 formal certificates.

&#160;

As of the date of this Report, &#160; we believe we are in material compliance with all registrations and requirements for the issuance and maintenance of all licenses required to conduct our businesses and operations.
