Wireless 

&#160; 

Background 

Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2015, Verizon Wireless had 112.1 million retail connections and 2015 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion, representing approximately 70% of Verizon&#146;s aggregate revenues. 

Verizon Wireless was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone). On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafone&#146;s indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. 

We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier&#146;s network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. 

We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology. 

&#160; 

Wireless Service and Product Offerings 

Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis. 

Wireless Services 

We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our retail connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2015. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. 

We offer various postpaid account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and plans tailored to the needs of our business customers. Our shared data plans feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, cloud storage and a single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customer&#146;s account. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. Shared data plans also include our Mobile Hotspot service at no additional charge. This service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses. 

Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans. Generally, customers entering into device installment agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However, certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan and trading in their device. 

In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customer&#146;s account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan. 

We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices. Our messaging services enable our customers to send and receive text, picture and video messages. In addition, access to the Internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks TM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. 

Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services and the Internet on all of our smartphones and many of our tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations. In addition, depending upon their wireless device&#146;s operating system, our customers have access to more than one million applications and services offered by Google Inc. (Google) via Google Play, Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes, Microsoft Inc. (Microsoft) via its Windows Phone operating system and BlackBerry Limited (BlackBerry) via its BlackBerry App World webstore. 

Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network. 

In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our IoT services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including health monitoring, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of IoT wireless connections, such as telematics, home monitoring, health monitoring, energy management and utilities management, will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their mobile lifestyle. (See &#147;New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives.&#148;) 

&#160; 

Wireless Devices 

We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. 

Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, Windows Phone OS, and BlackBerry OS. Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. 

Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules. During 2015, we continued to experience strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase. 

We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry and HTC. 

A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the &#147;intelligence&#148; of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. To support CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. 

Network 

We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2015, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 312 million people in the U.S., including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to approximately three million people and, to date, all participants have commenced 4G LTE operations on their networks. 

The reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage. 

We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density, by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses. 

Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in all critical locations. 

In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at-will by either party upon several months&#146; notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Technology 

Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Advanced Calling 1.0, a first generation suite of services enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. 

In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. We plan to launch field technology trials in 2016. 

Spectrum 

The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. 

In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction, and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. 

We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. The FCC will be auctioning television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range through a voluntary incentive auction that will take place in two phases. In the first phase, television broadcasters participating in the auction process will &#147;sell&#148; their rights to use such spectrum to the FCC. In the second phase, the FCC will &#147;resell&#148; that spectrum to various auction participants, including wireless service providers and other potential bidders. The incentive auction is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. 

Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. 

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions. 

Network Equipment and Build-out 

Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our switching equipment. In January 2016, Nokia Corporation acquired Alcatel-Lucent and combined operations. 

As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning, other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for macro cell sites. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. 

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. 

Marketing and Distribution 

Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizon&#146;s Wireline business units through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless&#146; solutions for medium and large business and government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. 

&#160; 

Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We have opened Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into &#147;Smart Stores,&#148; which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In addition, our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. 

Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&#38;T Inc. (AT&#38;T), Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA), as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. 

The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider&#146;s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. 

We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet customer demand. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to rollover unused data allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under the customer&#146;s service plan with its current wireless provider, and some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offers with other products. Some wireless providers also offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. 

Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly, and in some cases fully, subsidized the customer&#146;s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device installment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies. As a result of the increased penetration of device installment plans, we expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price, while meeting their wireless service needs. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to promote 

&#160; 

long-term relationships with our customers, we offer Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or for their provision of telematics services. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors. 

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors. 

&#160;

Wireline Background 

Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2015, Wireline revenues were $37.7 billion, representing approximately 29% of Verizon&#146;s aggregate revenues. 

In 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies. Accordingly, the historical Wireline results for these operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or segment results of operations, have been reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results. 

On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon&#146;s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon&#146;s continuing operations and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust authorities and state regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. 

Wireline Service and Product Offerings 

We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings &#150; mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale. 

&#160; 

Mass Markets 

Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), and local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2015, Mass Markets revenues were $18.5 billion, representing approximately 49% of Wireline&#146;s aggregate revenues. 

Internet services. We offer Fios Internet and high-speed Internet services with varying throughput speeds. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our Fios Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. As more data storage and, in some cases, processing is moved to the cloud, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads. 

Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2015, Fios video was available to approximately 16 million homes across 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fios Quantum TV , which provides customers the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fios Custom TV , which offers customers the option of purchasing a package of channels that includes a base set of select national networks and local broadcast stations plus their choice of two sets of channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment. Customers can add more sets of categorized channels to their Custom TV package for an additional monthly fee. As with all Fios TV packages, Custom TV customers also receive the Fios Local Package, which contains local versions of the Fox, CBS, NBCU, and ABC broadcast stations and other similar local content; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fios on Demand, which gives Fios customers the ability to watch content virtually anytime and anywhere, on any compatible device. Customers who subscribe to Fios Internet and video service also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal Fios on Demand Library, which gives them access to this content via various data-capable devices.

Global Wholesale 

Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services, primarily to local, long distance, wireless, and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2015, Global Wholesale revenues were $6.0 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wireline&#146;s aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. 

Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizon&#146;s other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers&#146; networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. 

New Ethernet connectivity in the U.S. represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale, as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in the future. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 4G and 3G networks. 

Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Managed services , which offer wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and web applications to Verizon; 

&#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Mobility offerings , which enable wholesale customers to enhance their portfolio to triple-play or quad-play capability by leveraging wireless devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Security services , which provide wholesale customers integrated solutions to help their enterprise end-users secure their networks and data. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Voice services . We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the United States and globally utilizing our TDM and VoIP networks. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. 

&#160; 

Network 

To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 20.5 million premises in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications, and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber optic infrastructure. While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is finding increased application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses seek to migrate to Ethernet-based access services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries and 2,700 cities. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations. 

Global IP volume has increased significantly over the last five years and substantial year-over-year growth is expected to continue. We deployed the industry&#146;s first 100G ultra-long-haul-system for live traffic in 2009, and have made additional 100G deployments on our European and Asia-Pacific long-haul networks, major U.S. backbone routes, and U.S. metro network. We have also completed a first office application of 200G technology on our U.S. long-haul network. This technology allows more information to be carried on a single wavelength while increasing the distance it can be sent without additional loss of signal quality. 

Global business is rapidly evolving to an &#147;everything-as-a-service&#148; model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. 

We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers. 

Competition 

The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. 

In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. 

We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Customer service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives. 

&#160; 

&#149; &#160; Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer. 

In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. 

We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. 

In the global enterprise market, the customer&#146;s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. 

Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. 

We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. 

&#160;

New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and IoT and create certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy, we have created an organization devoted to the development of new products and incubation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their wireless and wireline needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the following areas: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment. Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. On June 23, 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL). AOL is a leader in digital content and advertising. AOL&#146;s business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. 

We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. For example, in 2015 we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming. Digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content as well as original content. In January 2016, we introduced FreeBee Data, a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the provider&#146;s mobile content, or sponsor specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, all free of data charges to the customer. In February 2016, we announced we would offer retail postpaid Verizon Wireless customers video streaming in go90 over our 4G LTE network free of data charges via the FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data service. Customers must have the latest version of the go90 application to take advantage of this offer. 

We also began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we used to deliver live events in go90 in 2015. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. In order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers, we also are developing an IP television service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating back to any subscription. 

&#160; 

We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple, end-to-end, global platform for the delivery of media to customers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless offerings. 

Connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth as customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of broadband data, and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase. Our Fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and reliability. Broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of over-the-top video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number of connected homes and devices continues to grow. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Internet of Things and Telematics . The adoption of IoT technology continues to increase, primarily led by the telematics and transportation industries, as well as the fields of utility and energy management. Our strategy to simplify the IoT and accelerate its adoption includes the launch in 2015 of ThingSpace, our new IoT platform designed to assist developers create, test, manage and market their IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health care and connected cities. ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces as well as partner development kits. 

Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Networkfleet solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also provide this service to over 28,900 vehicles operated by Verizon. We are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities. 

During the third quarter of 2015, we announced the availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, to consumers. With this subscription-based service, drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and will be able to request roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Hum also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Fostering Effective Partnerships and Alliances . As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across all their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media, IoT and cloud to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation, which will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights, and application ecosystems. 

We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue, increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company. 

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable such third-party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizon&#146;s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. 

Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services.

Regulatory and Competitive Trends Regulatory and Competitive Landscape 

Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. 

FCC Regulation 

Wireless Services 

The FCC regulates several aspects of Verizon&#146;s wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. It can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals, and potential conditions. 

Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon&#146;s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called &#147;open access&#148; FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations, and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. 

Broadband 

Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC has recognized that broadband Internet access services are &#147;information services&#148; subject to a &#147;light touch&#148; regulatory approach rather than the traditional, utilities-style regulations that apply to traditional voice services. In its order imposing so-called &#147;network neutrality&#148; rules, the FCC reversed course in 2015 and declared that broadband Internet access services will now be treated as &#147;telecommunications services&#148; subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This decision creates uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services going forward. These regulations will limit the ways that broadband Internet access service providers can structure business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, which could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCC&#146;s decision is being challenged in court, and the proper scope of such regulations is also being debated in Congress. Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Verizon opposes the shift to utilities style regulation, however, which we believe is unnecessary, unlawful and harmful to the broader Internet ecosystem and our customers. 

Wireline Voice 

Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be &#147;common carrier&#148; services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions, and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. 

Video 

Verizon offers a multi-channel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In addition, the Act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise, and the FCC has adopted rules that interpret and implement this requirement. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. 

&#160; 

Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access 

The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. In many instances, Verizon makes payments to other providers, and in turn Verizon receives some payments from other carriers. In 2011, the FCC issued a broad reform order changing, among other things, the framework for many of the per-minute rates that carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic. The new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline &#147;special access&#148; and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services. For example, on the wireline side Verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers. On the wireless side, Verizon purchases special access and other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers. In addition, as required by the Act, Verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes these facilities and services available to other network providers. 

Universal Service 

The Communications Act charges the FCC with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services, including rural and other high-cost areas, low income subscribers, schools and libraries, rural health-care organizations, and deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The FCC established different subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals. To pay for these programs, the FCC requires contributions from providers such as Verizon based on reported revenues for certain services. Verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them. 

State Regulation and Local Regulation 

Wireless Services 

The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other &#147;terms and conditions&#148; of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. 

Wireline Services 

State public utility commissions regulate Verizon&#146;s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an &#147;incumbent local exchange carrier&#148; in 13 states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and to comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.
