 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

&#160; 

PART I - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Corporate History and Overview 

&#160; 

Ksix Media Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Ksix Holdings&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) is a digital advertising agency conglomerate serving customers worldwide online and across social media, gaming and mobile platforms. The Company seeks to acquire other niche marketing companies to grow market share and increase efficiency as part of an accretive strategy in the highly fragmented digital advertising sector. 

&#160; 

The Company is the parent of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Ksix Media, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which operates two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ksix, LLC and Blvd Media Group, LLC, both Nevada limited liability companies and both acquired by Ksix Media, Inc. from Paywall, Inc. on or about December 18, 2014 pursuant to a &#8220;Membership Interest Purchase Agreement&#8221;. Pursuant to this acquisition from Paywall, Inc., KSIX Media, Inc. assumed the remaining balance owed to Richard Brostrom pursuant to a October 26, 2011 &#8220;Unit Redemption Agreement&#8221; whereby Paywall, Inc. purchased the remaining 40% of Blvd Media Group, LLC from its partner. 

&#160; 

On October 12, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Common Stock (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with DigitizeIQ, LLC (&#8220;DIQ&#8221;), an Illinois Limited Liability Company and its sole owner. DIQ, whose primary business operation is a full service digital advertising agency specializing in survey generation and landing page optimization specifically designed for mass tort action lawsuits, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160; 

The Agreement provided for a purchase price of $1,250,000 to be paid as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Upon execution of the Agreement, the Company paid $250,000 in cash and issued 1,250,000 shares of its restricted common stock valued at $250,000; &#160; 

(a) On or about October 6, 2015, pursuant to a fully executed letter of intent, the Company caused to be paid to the Seller through an attorney escrow a non-refundable deposit in the amount of $25,000 USD which was applied to the Purchase Price upon closing. (b) On or about October 19, 2015 the Company paid the Seller $225,000 USD to complete the initial payment price. (c) On or about October 29, 2015, the Seller returned $150,000 USD of the initial payment price to the Company pursuant to a negotiated reduction in the purchase price of DIQ. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Issue a non-interest bearing Promissory Note made payable to the Seller in the amount of $250,000, which was due on November 12, 2015; &#160; 

The Company caused to be paid to the Seller $250,000 USD on February 26, 2016 to retire the Promissory Note due November 12, 2015 in full. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Issue a second non-interest bearing Promissory Note made payable to the Seller in the amount of $250,000, which was due on January 12, 2016; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Issue a third non-interest bearing Promissory Note made payable to the Seller in the amount of $250,000, which was due on March 12, 2016. &#160; 

As of the date of this filing, the Company owes the Seller a total of $500,000 USD towards the purchase price of DIQ which is represented by the Promissory Notes due on January 12, 2016 and March 12, 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Promissory Notes, the Company, with proper notice to the Seller, had a thirty (30) day grace period to cure any default resulting from the failure to pay the Seller or his assigns by the due date of each of the three listed Promissory Notes. 

&#160; 

Ksix Holdings is a reporting company under sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company changed its name and symbol from North American Energy Resources, Inc. and NAEY to Ksix Media Holdings, Inc. and KSIX, respectively, in July 2015. 

&#160; 

Prior to April 27, 2015, the Company operated solely as an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and the production of oil and natural gas through its wholly owned subsidiary, North American Exploration, Inc. The Company operated in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry which includes the drilling, completion and operation of oil and gas wells. The Company&#8217;s focus was on acquiring producing oil and gas properties or companies with development potential. On April 27, 2015, the Company acquired Ksix Media, Inc. pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, which resulted in the shareholders of Ksix Media, Inc. owning approximately 90% of the voting stock of North American Energy Resources, Inc., the Registrant, a Nevada corporation, listed under the symbol &#8220;NAEY&#8221; on the OTC Pink current information tier of the OTC Markets, Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition. 

&#160; 

The Company currently plans on keeping the business operations of North American Exploration, Inc. until it no longer is beneficial or profitable for Ksix Media Holdings Inc. 

&#160; 

Current advertising subsidiary operations include: Ksix Media, Inc. which acquired Blvd Media Group, LLC and Ksix, LLC on December 18, 2014 and DigitizeIQ, LLC which the Company acquired on October 12, 2015. 

&#160; 

Blvd Media Group, LLC (&#8220;BMG&#8221;), was formed in Nevada in 2009 to focus on providing online game and web publishers the tools to increase revenue within their environment. BMG&#8217;s mission is to monetize the Internet, promoting incentive based advertisements resulting in more clicks, greater lead generation and increased revenues. BMG has two operational sides of its business operations: 

&#160; 

First, BMG works with different advertisers that look for customers on a cost per lead basis. Advertisers commonly looking for performance-based pricing models include Cost-Per-Download (&#8220;CPD&#8221;), Cost-Per-Install (&#8220;CPI&#8221;), Cost-Per-Sale (&#8220;CPS&#8221;), Pay-Per-Click (&#8220;PPC&#8221;) and Cost-Per-View (&#8220;CPV&#8221;), whereby advertisers pay only when a consumer downloads an application, installs a software application, makes a purchase or views a video. Examples include but are not limited to game developers looking for installs of their application and advertisers looking to acquire email addresses so they can build their database for email promotions. Some advertisers look for surveys to be filled out or even an application such as school or insurance enrolment. 

&#160; 

Second, BMG works with game owners that install the rewards tool widget inside the game and offers gold coins to their users to fill out the advertisers offers (email submit, app download, surveys, etc.). The majority of the traffic that BMG is currently developing includes desktop video games called MMORPG&#8217;s (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games). 

&#160; 

BMG has its own proprietary software known as an &#8220;Offer Wall&#8221; that gaming programmers can implement into a gaming environment enabling users to engage with multiple advertising offers and to earn rewards for their engagement with varying compensation related to the gaming environment for completing the desired task the advertiser is requesting. Examples of the tasks include but are not limited to an email sign up, an app download, and registration for a product or service. Once the user completes the task BMG notifies the game owner and rewards the user a preselected amount of game currency. 

&#160; 

Ksix, LLC (&#8220;KSIX&#8221;), was created as an advertising network to compliment BMG. KSIX is designed to create revenue streams for BMG affiliates and provide advertisers with increased measurable audience through targeted cross-platform marketing strategies. KSIX provides performance based marketing solutions to drive traffic and conversions within a Cost-Per-Action (&#8220;CPA&#8221;) business model. The KSIX online advertising network works directly with advertisers and other networks to promote advertiser campaigns. KSIX manages offer tracking, reporting and distribution on the third-party platform. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

KSIX and its network offers advertisers an integrated digital advertising solution for campaign management. KSIX currently provides BMG with incentive offers, which accounts for approximately 30% of KSIX&#8217;s business. The rest of its business is generated through other affiliates in different verticals such non-incentive education enrollment, insurance applications, credit card trial offers and mobile installs. 

&#160; 

Both BMG and KSIX deal with incentive based advertising. Incentive based advertising occurs when a user viewing the advertisement gets some sort of reward for participating in the advertisers offer. These types of transactions are demonstrated frequently in online/mobile video games where users need in game currency to purchase an in game item. Online and mobile games will pay the users a certain amount of their game currency to participate with the advertisers offer to keep the user engaged in the game for free. Once the user completes the needed task with the advertisers offer, the advertiser pays us a commission for the action or lead generated and we split that commission with the game owner. 

&#160; 

Currently all KSIX and BMG revenues are generated through a CPA model but we have worked in and will be working in the cost-per-thousand and cost-per-click method. The same applies to Cost-per-Lead (CPL) models. 

&#160; 

DigitizeIQ, LLC (&#8220;DIQ&#8221;) is an Illinois Limited Liability Company formed on July 23, 2014 and was acquired by the Company on October 12, 2015. DIQ is a full service digital advertising agency specializing in survey generation and landing page optimization specifically designed for mass tort class action lawsuits. DIQ generally requires prepayment of the initial contracted amount, which will result in deferred revenue until DIQ delivers the contracted surveys. Receivables will arise from the initial contract billing and when DIQ, through agreement with the customer will deliver more surveys than originally contracted for. 

&#160; 

KSIX will garner additional revenue through branding, graphic design, web development, mobile software application development, search engine optimization, and social media curation offering a full in-house suite of creative and marking services. KSIX does anticipate working with more mobile advertising networks which has impacted its business by necessitating more involved collaboration with mobile advertisers and more directly supporting the affiliates that look for these install offers. 

&#160; 

Trademarked Products and Proprietary Technology: 

&#160; 

RewardTool&#174; - A proprietary &#8220;offer wall&#8221; or &#8220;ad container&#8221; that promotes hundreds of different advertising campaigns on a single web page. Offer walls, by definition, attract users with the premise of getting virtual currency without having to spend money. Instead they are asked to fill out a survey, download an app, watch a video, or sign up for something in return for the free currency. The RewardTool&#174; displays up to 1,000 offers and automatically rewards users upon completion. It is customizable and completely systematizes all of the processes needed to successfully run these campaigns. 

&#160; 

AccessTool&#174; - A proprietary &#8220;content locker&#8221; that is used to monetize any type of premium digital content like videos, music, or eBooks. Content lockers, by definition, attract users with the premise of access to premium content without having to spend money. Instead, they are asked to complete an advertiser&#8217;s offer in return for free access to the content. The AccessTool&#174; displays up to 1,000 offers and is customizable to match the design of any website. 

&#160; 

General Business Strategy: 

&#160;

In general, Ksix Holdings does not plan to focus in anyone one area of the digital advertising space &#8211; which includes online advertisements and across mobile, social media and gaming platforms. The Internet and digital advertising environment is always changing and the Company will only find success by anticipating trends within the industry and not merely reacting to them, which is the key to a successful advertising network. 

&#160; 

Instead, Ksix Holdings looks to grow by strategic acquisition of those niche companies who demonstrate performance-based success in specific digital advertising and marketing platforms. Because digital advertising and online marketing strategies are inherently low yield, the ability to make even small gains in efficiency benefits the Company and its network of partners and affiliates exponentially. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees and Labor Relations 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had eight full-time employees and three consultants. We plan to add corporate and managerial staff as necessary consistent with the growth of our operations. 

&#160; 

We plan to concentrate on the acquisition of companies where the employees are not, and have not historically been, members of unions. However, there is no assurance that any company that we acquire will not be the subject of a successful unionization vote. 

&#160; 

PART 1A - RISK FACTORS 

&#160; 

This Form 10-K contains &#8220;forward-looking statements.&#8221; The use of words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans&#8221; and &#8220;believes,&#8221; among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: Ksix Holding&#8217;s future financial performance, Ksix Holding&#8217;s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which Ksix Holding&#8217;s businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward-looking statements are based on Ksix Holdings management&#8217;s current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. 

&#160; 

Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: changes in senior management at Ksix Holdings and/or its businesses, changes in our relationship with, or policies implemented by, Google, adverse changes in economic conditions, either generally or in any of the markets or industries in which Ksix Holding&#8217;s businesses operate, adverse trends in the online advertising industry or the advertising industry generally, our ability to convert visitors to our various websites into users and customers, our ability to offer new or alternative products and services in a cost-effective manner and consumer acceptance of these products and services, changes in industry standards and technology, actual tax liabilities that differ materially from our estimates, operational and financial risks relating to acquisitions, our ability to expand successfully into international markets and regulatory changes. Certain of these and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in Ksix Holding&#8217;s filings with the SEC. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect Ksix Holding&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results may arise from time to time. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking statements discussed in this report may not prove to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of Ksix Holdings management as of the date of this report. Ksix Holdings does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

&#160; 

A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value-added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. 

&#160; 

For example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites. We also allow users to submit content, such as comments, photographs and videos. We could be subject to liability for posting, hosting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights. Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content. For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied. However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting) the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers. Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate. As a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Also, we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses, as well as develop, market and/or distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our B2C and B2B operations, which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications. For example, Canada&#8217;s Anti-Spam Legislation (&#8220;CASL&#8221;), which became effective on July 1, 2014, prohibits all commercial electronic messages (including e-mail, text, social media, sound and image messages) that are sent without proper consumer consent. And, effective January 15, 2015, the CASL restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications. While several Canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for CASL violations, effective July 1, 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for CASL violations. 

&#160; 

In addition, changing Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention. One example of such changing practices is the increasing use of &#8220;native&#8221; advertising, a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers. 

&#160; 

Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers. Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us. Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties. System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business. 

&#160; 

To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services. Moreover, as traffic to our websites, applications and online properties increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth. If we fail to do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or prolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences. In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect. Moreover, even if we do not experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers. Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time. Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers. While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy. 

&#160; 

We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience. As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations. Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets. 

&#160; 

We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence. In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States. Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks. For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences and political and/or economic instability, including issues associated with establishing and maintaining effective management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information. Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own. 

&#160; 

We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions. In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value. 

&#160; 

We continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets. As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts. 

&#160; 

Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; successfully manage acquisition-related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of Ksix Holdings and its businesses and/or acquired businesses. &#160; 

We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions. In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities. Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges. The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties. Any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyber attacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks or other malicious activities (or any combination of these events) is on the rise worldwide. From time to time, we may become the victim of these types of attacks. 

&#160; 

While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that these events will not occur in the future and if they do occur, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, we may become the victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations). 

&#160; 

Any cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as result in a degradation of our products and services and/or cause damage to our systems, infrastructures, technologies and data. Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect. Moreover, even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services. 

&#160; 

In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events. 

&#160; 

The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights. 

&#160; 

We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses. These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data. Examples include the European Union Data Protection Directive (as adopted and implemented by the various European Union member states, the &#8220;EU Directive&#8221;), various U.S. state regulations concerning minimum data security standards, industry self-regulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections (and related compliance obligations) regarding privacy and data security. 

&#160; 

In addition, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws. Similarly, in the European Union, the online service provider could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority (an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws), as well as private causes of action under the EU Directive. In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world (particularly in the European Union), the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

U.S. and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security. For example, in May 2014, the White House released a review of &#8220;big data&#8221; practices, which called for an update to U.S. privacy laws based on the proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights released by the White House in February 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law. In addition, in February 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a report seeking changes in Internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures. Similarly, new privacy laws and regulations at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly in the European Union), are being proposed and implemented. For example, legislation in the state of California that became effective on January 1, 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; signals and the European Union is in the process of adopting new guidelines for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments, which will supersede the EU Directive. In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses. Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches. In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. Moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards, as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services. 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services. While many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers. While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services. In addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers. Lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread, we will need to take steps to ensure that our products and services are attractive to users of mobile devices. This shift could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues. 

&#160; 

The Internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes. 

&#160; 

The development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the Internet, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner. Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete. Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and advertisers offers. 

&#160; 

We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites, advertisers offers and convert visitors into repeat users and customers. How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and offers, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally. 

&#160; 

For example, we have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute surveys, CPA offers, and app installs through third parties. Most of these agreements are either non-exclusive and short-term in nature or, in the case of long-term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances. In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our B2B operations. Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our advertisers offers through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the Internet. 

&#160; 

We continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market. We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud. Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure, an industry-wide move to self-regulatory principles that require additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporate user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising. Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures. Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending. 

&#160; 

Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit. In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We depend on our key personnel. 

&#160; 

Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees across Ksix Holdings and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Mr. Matzinger owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations. 

&#160; 

As of December 9, 2015, Mr. Matzinger owned 24,778,761 shares of Ksix Holdings common stock representing 68.58% of Ksix Holdings outstanding common stock and approximately 68.58% of the total outstanding voting power of Ksix Holdings. 

&#160; 

In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between Ksix Holdings and Mr. Matzinger, for so long as Mr. Matzinger serves as Ksix Holdings Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that Ksix Holding&#8217;s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period. While Mr. Matzinger may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Matzinger will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case Ksix Holding would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right. 

&#160; 

As a result of Mr. Matzinger&#8217;s ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Matzinger currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Nevada law, the composition of Ksix Holding&#8217;s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to Ksix Holding&#8217;s, which could adversely affect the market price of Ksix Holdings securities. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES AND THE OVER THE COUNTER MARKET 

&#160; 

Trading on the Pink Sheets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. 

&#160; 

Even though we are a fully reporting issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our common stock is quoted on the &#8220;Pink Sheets&#8221; as provided by OTC Markets under the ticker symbol &#8220;KSIX&#8221; (the &#8220;Pink Sheets&#8221;). Trading in stock quoted on the Pink Sheets, or any other over the counter venues, is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the Pink Sheets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the Pink Sheets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC&#8217;s penny stock regulations and FINRA&#8217;s sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

&#160; 

Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and &#8220;accredited investors&#8221;. The term &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#8217;s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 

&#160; 

In addition to the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&#8217; requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. 

&#160; 

Rule 144 sales in the future may have a depressive effect on our stock price as an increase in supply of shares for sale, with no corresponding increase in demand will cause prices to fall. 

&#160; 

All of the outstanding shares of common stock held by the present officers, directors, and affiliate stockholders are &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who is an affiliate or officer or director who has held restricted securities for six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1.0% of a company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. There is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate after the owner has held the restricted securities for a period of six months if the company is a current reporting company under the 1934 Act. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop. 

&#160; 

FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

&#160; 

In addition to the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

&#160; 

It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the additional internal controls, processes and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal auditing and other finance staff in order to develop and implement appropriate additional internal controls, processes and reporting procedures. 

&#160; 

If we fail to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal control over financial reporting or to remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify, such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and current SEC regulations, we are required to prepare assessments regarding internal controls over financial reporting and, furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We have begun the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy these requirements, which is likely to result in increased general and administrative expenses and may shift management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. While our management is expending significant resources in an effort to complete this important project, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our objective on a timely basis. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment or complete our Section 404 certifications could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. 

&#160; 

In addition, in connection with our on-going assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may discover &#8220;material weaknesses&#8221; in our internal controls as defined in standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The PCAOB defines &#8220;significant deficiency&#8221; as a deficiency that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. 

&#160; 

In the event that a material weakness is identified, we will employ qualified personnel and adopt and implement policies and procedures to address any material weaknesses that we identify. However, the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take will remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial process and reporting in the future. 

&#160; 

Any failure to complete our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify or to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 

&#160; 

We do not intend to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, and, if dividends are rapid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation, thereby diverting our resources that may have a material effect on our profitability and results of operations. 

&#160; 

As discussed in the preceding risk factors, the market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management&#8217;s attention and resources. 

&#160; 

If we are unable to continue as a going concern, investors may face a complete loss of their investment. 

&#160; 

The independent auditor&#8217;s report on our financial statements contains explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report states that we depend on the continued contributions of our executive officers to work effectively as a team, to execute our business strategy and to manage our business. The loss of key personnel, or their failure to work effectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing in the near term or achieve profitability, then we would, in all likelihood, experience severe liquidity problems and may have to curtail our operations. If we curtail our operations, we may be placed into bankruptcy or undergo liquidation, the result of which will adversely affect the value of our common shares. 

&#160; 

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management team. 

&#160; 

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. 

&#160; 

OTHER RISKS 

&#160; 

Trends, Risks and Uncertainties 

&#160; 

We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.
