 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

United Fire Group, Inc. ("UFG", "United Fire", the "Registrant", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the business of writing property and casualty insurance and life insurance and selling annuities through a network of independent agencies. Our insurance company subsidiaries are currently licensed as a property and casualty insurer in 46 &#32;states, plus the District of Columbia and as a life insurer in 37 &#32;states. United Fire &#38; Casualty Company was incorporated in Iowa in January 1946. Our principal executive office is located at 118 Second Avenue SE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401; telephone: 319-399-5700. 

United Fire Group, Inc. owns 100 percent of one subsidiary, United Fire &#38; Casualty Company. United Fire &#38; Casualty Company owns 100 percent of eight subsidiaries: United Life Insurance Company, Addison Insurance Company, Lafayette Insurance Company, United Fire &#38; Indemnity Company, Mercer Insurance Company, Financial Pacific Insurance Company, UFG Specialty Insurance Company (formerly known as Texas General Indemnity Company) and United Real Estate Holdings Company, LLC. Mercer Insurance Company owns 100 percent of two subsidiaries: Franklin Insurance Company and Mercer Insurance Company of New Jersey, Inc. United Fire Lloyds is an affiliate of United Fire &#38; Indemnity Company. 

In 2015, the Company dissolved three of its holding companies in order to flatten our organizational chart. The companies dissolved were American Indemnity Financial Corporation, Mercer Insurance Group, Inc. and Financial Pacific Insurance Group, Inc. In addition, Texas General Indemnity Company was renamed UFG Specialty Insurance Company on July 1, 2015. 

Holding Company Reorganization 

On February 1, 2012, we completed a holding company reorganization (the "Reorganization") of United Fire Group, Inc., United Fire &#38; Casualty Company, and UFC MergeCo, Inc., an Iowa corporation formed for the purpose of facilitating the Reorganization. The Reorganization agreement was approved and adopted by United Fire &#38; Casualty Company shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders held on January 24, 2012. 

The Reorganization agreement provided for the merger of United Fire &#38; Casualty Company with UFC MergeCo, Inc., with United Fire &#38; Casualty Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of United Fire Group, Inc. Each share of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3 per share, of United Fire &#38; Casualty Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, converted into one duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of United Fire Group, Inc. In addition, each outstanding option to purchase or right to acquire shares of United Fire &#38; Casualty Company common stock was automatically converted into an option to purchase or right to acquire, upon the same terms and conditions, an identical number of shares of United Fire Group, Inc. common stock. 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, United Fire Group, Inc., an Iowa corporation, replaced United Fire &#38; Casualty Company, an Iowa corporation, as the publicly held corporation, and the holders of United Fire &#38; Casualty Company common stock then held the same number of shares at the same ownership percentage of United Fire Group, Inc. as they held of United Fire &#38; Casualty Company immediately prior to the Reorganization. On February 2, 2012, shares of United Fire Group, Inc. common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "UFCS." 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 1,057 &#32;full-time employees and 13 &#32;part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. 

Reportable Segments 

We report our operations in two business segments: property and casualty insurance and life insurance. Our property and casualty insurance segment is comprised of commercial lines insurance, including surety bonds, personal lines insurance and assumed reinsurance. Our life insurance segment is comprised of deferred and immediate fixed annuities, universal life insurance products and traditional life insurance products. A table reflecting revenues, net income and assets attributable to our operating segments is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 10 "Segment Information." All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

All of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and our affiliate belong to an intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangement. On July 1, 2015, UFG Specialty Insurance Company (formerly known as Texas General Indemnity Company) entered the pooling arrangement. Pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's capital and surplus, rather than being limited to policy exposures of a size commensurate with each participant's own surplus level. Under such arrangements, the members share substantially all of the insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses based on percentages defined in the arrangement. 

Our life insurance segment consists solely of the operations of United Life Insurance Company.

We staff our regional offices with underwriting, claims and marketing representatives and administrative technicians, all of whom provide support and assistance to the independent agencies. Also, home office staff technicians and specialists provide support to our subsidiaries, regional offices and independent agencies. We use management reports to monitor subsidiary and regional offices for overall results and conformity to our business policies. 

Competition 

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous property and casualty insurance companies in the regional and national market, many of which are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial and other resources. Except for regulatory considerations, there are limited barriers to entry into the insurance industry. Our competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The exact number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. 

In addition, because our products are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agencies, most of which represent more than one company, we face competition within each agency and competition to retain qualified independent agents. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. 

Because we rely solely on independent agencies, we offer a competitive commissions program and a rewarding profit-sharing plan as incentives for agents to place high-quality property and casualty insurance business with us. Property and casualty insurance agencies will receive profit-sharing payments of $21.2 million &#32;in 2016 , based on profitable business produced by the agencies in 2015 . In 2015 &#32;for 2014 &#32;business, agencies received $17.6 million &#32;in profit-sharing payments and in 2014 &#32;for 2013 &#32;business, agencies received $19.2 million &#32;in payments. 

Our competitive advantages include our commitment to: 

&#8226; 

Strong agency relationships &#8212; 

&#9702; 

A stable workforce, with an average duration of employment of approximately 10.6 &#32;years, allows our agents to work with the same, highly-experienced personnel each day. 

&#9702; 

Our organization is relatively flat, allowing our agents to be close to the highest levels of management and ensuring that our agents will receive answers quickly to their questions. 

&#8226; 

Exceptional service &#8212; our agents and policyholders always have the option to speak with a real person. 

&#8226; 

Fair and prompt claims handling &#8212; we view claims as an opportunity to prove to our customers that they have chosen the right insurance company. 

&#8226; 

Disciplined underwriting &#8212; we empower our underwriters with the knowledge and tools needed to make good decisions for the Company. 

&#8226; 

Superior loss control services &#8212; our loss control representatives make multiple visits to businesses and job sites each year to ensure safety. 

&#8226; 

Effective and efficient use of technology &#8212; we use technology to provide enhanced service to our agents and policyholders, not to replace our personal relationships, but to reinforce them. 

Life Insurance Segment 

Our life insurance subsidiary markets its products primarily in the Midwest, East Coast and West. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;the direct statutory premiums written by our life insurance operations were distributed as follows:

Competition 

We encounter significant competition in all lines of our life and fixed annuity business from other life insurance companies and other providers of financial services. Since our products are marketed exclusively through independent life insurance agencies that typically represent more than one company, we face competition within our agencies. Competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell directly to their customers. The exact number of competitors within the industry is not known. 

To attract and maintain relationships with our independent life insurance agencies, we offer competitive commission rates and other sales incentives. Our life insurance segment achieves a competitive advantage by offering products that are simple and straightforward, by providing outstanding customer service, by being accessible to our agents and customers, and by using technology in a variety of ways to assist our agents and improve the delivery of service to our policyholders. 

OPERATING SEGMENTS 

Information specific to the reportable business segments in our operations, including products, pricing and seasonality of premiums written is incorporated by reference from Note 10 "Segment Information" contained in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Additionally, for a detailed discussion of our operating results by segment, refer to the "Consolidated Results of Operations" section in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

REINSURANCE 

Incorporated by reference from Note 4 "Reinsurance" contained in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

RESERVES 

Property and Casualty Insurance Segment 

Property insurance indemnifies an insured with an interest in physical property for loss of, or damage to, such property or the loss of its income-producing abilities. Casualty insurance primarily covers liability for damage to property of, or injury to, a person or entity other than the insured. In most cases, casualty insurance also obligates the insurance company to provide a defense for the insured in litigation, arising out of events covered by the policy. 

Liabilities for loss and loss settlement expenses reflect management's best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay for claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), based on known facts, circumstances, and historical trends. 

The determination of reserves (particularly those relating to liability lines of insurance that have relatively longer lag in claim reporting) requires significant work to reasonably project expected future claim reporting and payment patterns. If, during the course of our regular monitoring of reserves, we determine that coverages previously written are incurring higher than expected losses, we will take action that may include, among other things, increasing the related reserves. Any adjustments we make to reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which we make those adjustments. We engage an independent actuary, Regnier Consulting Group, Inc. ("Regnier"), to render an opinion as to the adequacy of our statutory reserves annually. The actuarial opinion is filed in those states where we are licensed. 

On a quarterly basis, United Fire's internal actuary performs a detailed actuarial review of IBNR reserves. This review includes a comparison of results from the most recent analysis of reserves completed by both our internal and external actuaries. Senior management meets with our internal actuary to review, on a regular and quarterly basis, the adequacy of carried reserves based on results from this actuarial analysis. There are two fundamental types or sources of IBNR reserves. We record IBNR reserves for "normal" types of claims and also specific IBNR reserves related to unique circumstances or events. A major hurricane is an example of an event that might necessitate establishing specific IBNR reserves because an analysis of existing historical data would not provide an appropriate estimate. 

We do not discount loss reserves based on the time value of money. There are no material differences between our reserves established under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and our statutory reserves. 

The following table illustrates the change in our estimate of loss reserves for our property and casualty insurance companies for the years 2005 through 2015. The first section shows the amount of the liability, as originally reported, at the end of each calendar year in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These reserves represent the estimated amount of losses and loss settlement expenses for losses arising in that year and all prior years that are unpaid at the end of each year, including an estimate for our IBNR losses, net of applicable ceded reinsurance. The second section displays the cumulative amount of net losses and loss settlement expenses paid for each year with respect to that liability. The third section shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the losses for individual years. The last section compares the latest re-estimated amount with the original estimate. Conditions and trends that have affected development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily exist in the future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to project future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

For a more detailed discussion of our loss reserves, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5 "Reserves for Losses and Loss Settlement Expenses" contained in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

Life Insurance Segment 

We calculate the policy reserves reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. For our fixed annuities and universal life policies, we establish a benefit reserve at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received. Subsequently, we adjust the benefit reserve for any additional deposits, interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals, as well as insurance and other expense charges. We base policy reserves for other life products on the projected contractual benefits and expenses and interest rates appropriate to those products. We base reserves for accident and health products, which are a minor portion of our reserves, on appropriate morbidity tables. 

We determine reserves for statutory purposes based upon mortality rates and interest rates specified by Iowa state law. Our life insurance subsidiary's reserves meet or exceed the minimum statutory requirements. Griffith, Ballard &#38; Company, an independent actuary, assists us in developing and analyzing our reserves on both a GAAP and statutory basis. 

For further discussion of our life insurance segment's reserves, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

INVESTMENTS 

Incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," under the headings "Investments," "Market Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies"; and Note 1 "Significant Accounting Policies" under the headings "Investments," Note 2 "Summary of Investments," and Note 3 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," contained in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

REGULATION 

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Each jurisdiction in which we operate has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers. While we are not aware of any currently proposed or recently enacted state or federal regulation that would have a material impact on our operations, we cannot predict the effect that future regulatory changes might have on us. 

State Regulation 

We are subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state, but generally has its source in National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") model laws and regulations that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency. Moreover, the NAIC Accreditation Program requires state regulatory agencies to meet baseline standards of solvency regulation, particularly with respect to regulation of multi-state insurers. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use our insurance products, and not our shareholders. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including: insurance company licensing and examination; the licensing of insurance agents and adjusters; price setting or premium rates; trade practices; approval of policy forms; claims practices; restrictions on transactions between our subsidiaries and their affiliates, including the payment of dividends; investments; underwriting standards; advertising and marketing practices; capital adequacy; and the collection, remittance and reporting of certain taxes, licenses and fees. 

The state laws and regulations that have the most significant effect on our insurance operations and financial reporting are discussed below. 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation 

We are regulated as an insurance holding company system in the states of domicile of our property and casualty insurance companies and life insurance subsidiary: Iowa (United Fire &#38; Casualty Company, United Life Insurance Company, UFG Specialty Insurance Company and Addison Insurance Company), California (Financial Pacific Insurance Company), Louisiana (Lafayette Insurance Company), New Jersey (Mercer Insurance Company of New Jersey, Inc.), Pennsylvania (Mercer Insurance Company and Franklin Insurance Company) and Texas (United Fire &#38; Indemnity Company and United Fire Lloyds). These regulations require that we annually furnish financial and other information about the operations of the individual companies within our holding company system. Generally, the insurance laws of these states provide that notice to the state insurance commissioner is required before finalizing any transaction affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and before finalizing certain material transactions between an insurer and any person or entity within its holding company system. In addition, some of those transactions cannot be finalized without the commissioner's prior approval. 

Most states have now adopted the version of the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulation Act and Regulation as amended by the NAIC in December 2010 (the "Amended Model Act") to introduce the concept of "enterprise risk" within an insurance company holding system. Enterprise risk is defined as any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. The Amended Model Act imposes more extensive informational requirements on us, including requiring us to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within our insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to our licensed insurers. Compliance with new reporting requirements under the Amended Model Act began for us in 2014 for the 2013 fiscal year. 

Restrictions on Shareholder Dividends 

As an insurance holding company with no independent operations or source of revenue, our capacity to pay dividends to our shareholders is based on the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is regulated by the laws of their state of domicile. Under these laws, insurance companies must provide advance informational notice to the domicile state insurance regulatory authority prior to payment of any dividend or distribution to its shareholders. Prior approval from the state insurance regulatory authority must be obtained before payment of an "extraordinary dividend" as defined under the state's insurance code. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to us is subject to certain limitations, the amounts of which change each year. In all cases, we may pay dividends only from our earned surplus. Refer to the "Market Information" section of Part II, Item 5, "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," and Note 6 "Statutory Reporting, Capital Requirements and Dividends and Retained Earnings Restrictions," contained in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the dividends we paid during 2015 . 

Price Regulation 

Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring us to file rate schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In certain states, rate schedules, policy forms, or both, must be approved prior to use. While insurance laws vary from state to state, their objectives are generally the same: an insurance rate cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The speed with which we can change our rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on the willingness of state regulators to allow adequate rates for the business we write. 

Investment Regulation 

We are subject to various state regulations requiring investment portfolio diversification and limiting the concentration of investments we may maintain in certain asset categories. Failure to comply with these regulations leads to the treatment of nonconforming investments as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, state regulations require us to sell certain nonconforming investments. 

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Nonrenewing Policies 

Most states regulate our ability to exit a market. For example, states limit, to varying degrees, our ability to cancel and nonrenew insurance policies. Some states prohibit us from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except upon prior regulatory approval. Regulations that limit policy cancellation and nonrenewal may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. 

Insurance Guaranty Associations 

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws. Membership in a state's insurance guaranty association is generally mandatory for insurers wishing to do business in that state. Under these laws, associations may assess their members for certain obligations that insolvent insurance companies have incurred with regard to their policyholders and claimants. 

Typically, states assess each solvent association member with an amount related to that member's proportionate share of business written by all association members within the state. Most state guaranty associations allow solvent insurers to recoup the assessments they are charged through future rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately recover these assessments. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments or refunds under these laws. 

Shared Market and Joint Underwriting Plans 

State insurance regulations often require insurers to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations. These are mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various types of basic insurance coverage that may not otherwise be available to them through voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are most commonly instituted for automobile and workers' compensation insurance, but many states also mandate participation in Fair Access to Insurance Requirements ("FAIR") Plans or Windstorm Plans, which provide basic property coverage. Participation is based upon the amount of a company's voluntary market share in a particular state for the classes of insurance involved. Policies written through these mechanisms may require different underwriting standards and may pose greater risk than those written through our voluntary application process. 

Statutory Accounting Rules 

For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, state laws require us to calculate and report certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data frequently is used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. 

Insurance Reserves 

State insurance laws require that insurance companies analyze the adequacy of their reserves annually. Our appointed actuaries must submit an opinion that our statutory reserves are adequate to meet policy claims-paying obligations and related expenses. 

Financial Solvency Ratios 

The NAIC annually calculates 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. A "usual range" of results for each of these ratios is used by insurance regulators as a benchmark. Departure from the usual range on four or more of the ratios could lead to inquiries from individual state insurance departments as to certain aspects of a company's business. In addition to the financial ratios, states also require us to calculate a minimum capital requirement for each of our insurance companies based on individual company insurance risk factors. These "risk-based capital" results are used by state insurance regulators to identify companies that require regulatory attention or the initiation of regulatory action. At December 31, 2015 , all of our insurance companies had capital in excess of the required levels. 

Federal Regulation 

Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives and legislation often have an impact on our business. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals, proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures, terrorism risk mechanisms, federal financial services reforms, various tax proposals affecting insurance companies, and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 

Various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have impacted and will continue to impact our industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing direct actions against insurers related to bad 

faith claims. As a result of this unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and other specialty coverages. 

Dodd-Frank expanded the federal presence in insurance oversight and may increase regulatory requirements that are applicable to us. Dodd-Frank's requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance (property or casualty insurance placed with insurers that are eligible to accept insurance, but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state). Dodd-Frank also established the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters, and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. 

Dodd-Frank also contains a number of provisions related to corporate governance and disclosure matters. In 

response to Dodd-Frank, the SEC has adopted or proposed rules regarding director independence, director and officer hedging activities, executive compensation clawback policies, compensation advisor independence, pay versus performance disclosures, internal pay equity disclosures, and shareholder proxy access. We continue to monitor developments under Dodd-Frank and their impact on us, insurers of similar size and the insurance industry as a whole. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act may increase our operating costs and underwriting losses. This landmark legislation continues to result in numerous changes within the health care industry that could create additional operating costs for us, particularly with respect to our workers' compensation products. 

FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND ISSUER CREDIT RATING 

Our financial strength, as measured by statutory accounting principles, is regularly reviewed by an independent rating agency that assigns a rating based upon criteria such as results of operations, capital resources and minimum policyholders' surplus requirements. An insurer's financial strength rating is one of the primary factors evaluated by those in the market to purchase insurance. A poor rating indicates that there is an increased likelihood that the insurer could become insolvent and therefore not able to fulfill its obligations under the insurance policies it issues. This rating can also affect an insurer's level of premium writings, the lines of business it can write and, for insurers like us that are also public registrants, the market value of its securities. 

Our property and casualty insurers are rated by A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") on a group basis. Our pooled property and casualty insurers have all received an "A" (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best. Our life insurance subsidiary has received an "A-" (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best. According to A.M. Best, companies rated "A" and "A-" have "an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders." 

A.M. Best also assigns issuer credit ratings based on a company's ability to repay its debts. All of our property and casualty insurers have received an issuer credit rating of "a" from A.M. Best. Our life insurance subsidiary has received an issuer credit rating of "a-" from A.M. Best. Beginning in 2012, our holding company parent was also rated by A.M. Best, receiving an issuer credit rating of "bbb."
