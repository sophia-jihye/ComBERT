 Item 1. Business

Gene ral Description of Business

Nordson engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, nonwovens, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing.

Our strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers&#8217; needs globally. We are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio, and our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 71 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2016.

We have 6,127 employees worldwide. Principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

Corporate Purpose and Goals

We strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.

We operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies.

Although every quarter may not produce increased sales, net income and earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter, we do expect to produce long-term gains. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our basic objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences.

We drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies, and by leveraging existing technology into new applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that serve international growth markets, share our business model characteristics and can leverage our global infrastructure.

We create benefits for our customers through a Package of Values&#174;, which includes carefully engineered, durable products; strong service support; the backing of a well-established, worldwide company with financial and technical strengths; and a corporate commitment to deliver what was promised.

We strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction; it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business.

Complementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department&#8217;s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives.

We recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all business units, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives.

&#160;

We drive continuous improvement in all areas of the company through the Nordson Business System (NBS), our collected set of tools and best practices. Rooted in Lean Six Sigma methodologies, the NBS is applied throughout all business units and corporate functions. Closely tied to the NBS are a set of key performance indicators that help define and measure progress toward corporate goals. The NBS is underpinned by our timeless corporate values of customer passion, energy, excellence, integrity and respect for people. 

We are an equal opportunity employer.

We are committed to contributing approximately five percent of domestic pretax earnings to human welfare services, education and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations.

Manufacturing an d Raw Materials 

Our production operations include machining, molding and assembly. We manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment. Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Wisconsin; as well as in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

Principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. All significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources.

Senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes.

Natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed.

Intellectual Property

We maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property (including patents, trademarks and copyrights) both domestically and internationally. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Our intellectual property portfolios include valuable patents, trade secrets, know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names. As of October 31, 2016, we held 541 United States patents and 1,207 foreign patents and had 212 United States patent applications pending and 878 foreign patent applications pending, but there is no assurance that any patent application will be issued. We continue to apply for and obtain patent protection for new products on an ongoing basis.

Patents covering individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. Our current patent portfolio has expiration dates ranging from November 2016 to February 2041. The actual protection a patent provides, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country. We believe, however, that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents.

We believe our trademarks are important assets and we aggressively manage our brands. We also own a number of trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, including registered trademarks for Nordson, Asymtek, Dage, EFD, Value Plastics, and Xaloy and various common law trademarks which are important to our business, inasmuch as they identify Nordson and our products to our customers. As of October 31, 2016, we had a total of 2,084 trademark registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries.

We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights and also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, convey all rights to inventions to us, and restrict the distribution of proprietary information.

We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our right to sell our products. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not believe that the loss of any one patent, trademark, or group of related patents or trademarks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position of our overall business.

Seasonal Variation in Business

Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the year due in large part to the timing of customers&#8217; capital spending programs. Accordingly, first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers&#8217; capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns.

Nordson Corporation 7 

&#160;

Working Capit al Practices 

No special or unusual practices affect our working capital. We generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and, in certain cases, require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products. We continue to initiate new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times, resulting in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs.

Customers

We serve a broad customer base, both in terms of industries and geographic regions. In 2016, no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of sales.

Backlog

Our backlog of open orders increased to approximately $274,000 at October 31, 2016 from approximately $228,000 at October 31, 2015. The amounts for both years were calculated based upon exchange rates in effect at October 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to orders within the Advanced Technology Systems segment. All orders in the 2016 year-end backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in 2017.

Governme nt Contracts

Our business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts. Therefore, no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government.

Competitive Conditions

Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting, and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality.

Many factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage.

Research and Development

Investments in research and development are important to our long-term growth, enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products. We place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams. Research and development expenses were approximately $46,247 in 2016, compared with approximately $46,689 in 2015 and $47,536 in 2014. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were approximately 2.6, 2.8 and 2.8 percent in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Environmental Compliance

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate.

Nordson Corporation 8 

&#160;

We believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and w ill continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a mat erial effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirement s or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated. 

We believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations. We accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws during 2016 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future.

Employees

As of October 31, 2016, we had 6,127 full-time and part-time employees, including 149 at our Amherst, Ohio, facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 3, 2019 and 37 at our New Castle, Pennsylvania facility who are represented by collective bargaining agreements that expire on August 31, 2017. No work stoppages have been experienced at any of our facilities during any of the periods covered by this report.
