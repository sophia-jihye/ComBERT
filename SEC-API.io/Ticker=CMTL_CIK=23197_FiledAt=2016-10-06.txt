 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

We are a leading provider of advanced communications solutions for both commercial and government customers worldwide. Our solutions fulfill our customers&#8217; needs for secure wireless communications in some of the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical scenarios where performance is crucial. 

On February 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. ("TCS"). The TCS acquisition has a preliminary aggregate purchase price for accounting purposes of approximately $340.4 million (also referred to as the "transaction equity value"). As of February 23, 2016, the date we closed the acquisition, TCS had $59.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt (including capital lease obligations and accrued interest) of approximately $143.1 million. As such, the transaction had an enterprise value of approximately $423.6 million. 

TCS is a leading provider of advanced communication solutions, including mission-critical command and control technologies, safety and security technologies and enterprise technologies. We believe that the acquisition of TCS provides us with a number of key strategic and financial benefits, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The creation of scale and more diversified earnings streams, reducing volatility associated with challenging international (including emerging markets) business conditions; 

&#8226; 

Entry into commercial markets at growth inflection points, including the public safety market which has a growing need for next generation emergency 911 systems that utilize messaging and trusted location technologies; 

&#8226; 

An enhanced position with existing customers, including the U.S. government, for which Comtech is now a prime contractor, including for sales of our over-the-horizon microwave systems (troposcatter) products; and 

&#8226; 

The ability to obtain meaningful cost synergies and additional growth prospects. 

The TCS acquisition was a significant step in our strategy of entering complementary markets and expanding our domestic and international commercial offerings. In connection with the TCS acquisition, we announced a new organizational structure by which we began managing our combined businesses through two reportable operating segments that we refer to as Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. 

Our fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, which includes approximately five months of TCS&#8217;s operations, generated revenues of $411.0 million , an operating loss of $0.6 million &#32;(inclusive of $21.3 million &#32;of expenses primarily related to the TCS acquisition) and Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure) of $48.1 million . For a definition and explanation of Adjusted EBITDA, see &#8220; Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of Fiscal 2016 and 2015 - Adjusted EBITDA. &#8221; 

As we enter fiscal 2017, we have a backlog of $484.0 million and we are expecting significant year-over-year increases in net sales, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced that our Chairman of the Board resumed his role as Chief Executive Officer and President. Additionally, we created a new role of Chief Operating Officer, and we filled this position on September 26, 2016. In view of our transformative acquisition of TCS and the broad opportunities for future growth across all of our businesses, we believe these leadership changes will enhance our ability to manage expected growth, and reinforce company-wide execution and operational discipline, with a view to building long-term value for our shareholders. Our Business Outlook for fiscal 2017 is discussed further in " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Outlook for Fiscal 2017. "

The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies is based on our competitive strengths, including the following: 

(1) 

We Have Significant Exposure to Large, Growing End Markets 

We believe Comtech is well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant emerging technology trends occurring worldwide and that customers around the world will increasingly turn to us to fulfill their needs for secure wireless communications in some of the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical scenarios where performance is crucial. These important emerging technology trends include growth in global wireless penetration and mobile data consumption, proliferation of mobile applications requiring trusted location data, widespread deployment of in-flight connectivity solutions by airlines worldwide, and the rapidly expanding breadth of High Definition ("HD") and 4K broadcasting content. 

(2) 

We Believe We Are a Market Leader in the End-Markets That We Serve &#32; 

Commercial Solutions Segment &#32; 

Communication Technologies - We believe we are the leading provider of Single Carrier per Channel ("SCPC") satellite earth station modems. Many of our key satellite earth station products incorporate Turbo Product Code ("TPC") forward error correction technology and our licensed DoubleTalk &#174; &#32;Carrier-in-Carrier &#174; &#32;bandwidth compression technology which enables our customers to optimize their satellite networks by either reducing their satellite transponder lease costs or increasing data throughput. We believe we are a leader in the traveling wave tube amplifiers ("TWTA") market and we differentiate our product offerings by our ability to develop the most efficient size, weight and power profile. Our TWTA products are vital to satellite communication applications such as traditional broadcast, direct-to-home ("DTH") broadcast and satellite newsgathering. We provide solid-state amplifiers that are also used to amplify signals carrying voice, video or data for air-to-satellite-to-ground communications. For example, our amplifiers, when incorporated into an aircraft satellite communication system, can provide passengers with email, Internet access and video conferencing. Certain of our high-powered amplifiers are AS-900 (an airborne quality standard ) certified. We believe we are a leader in providing amplifiers for the growing in-flight connectivity market. 

Safety and Security Technologies - We believe that we are a leader in public safety communication technologies used for delivery of 911 calls. We believe we have significant market share in the routing of U.S. wireless 911 calls, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") 911 calls and Text to 911 deployments. We believe we are one of two companies fulfilling the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") requirements for Enhanced 911 ("E911") call-routing to public safety answering points ("PSAPs") for wireless and VoIP network operators. E911 refers to 911 calls for both wireline and wireless telephones that are enhanced to provide location information of the caller. We are focusing our marketing and research and development efforts to meet system standards for next generation 911 ("NG911"), which refers to an Internet Protocol ("IP") based system that allows digital information (e.g., voice, photos, videos, text messages) to flow seamlessly from the public, through the 911 network, and on to emergency responders. 

Enterprise Technologies &#8201;- Our Short-Messaging Service ("SMS") Center software has been used by wireless carrier subscribers to send and receive text or data messages to and from wireless devices for almost two decades. We provide ongoing operational support for our installed base of systems, including administration of system components, system optimization and configuration management. In April 2016, we were issued a U.S. patent for our Location Trust Score technology, a unique process we developed to reliably identify a mobile location by generating a "Location Trust Score." Additionally, we have developed a location-based services platform that we refer to as Location Studio TM . This platform includes Look4 TM &#32;geo-services which enable customers to build their own applications powered by our location-based technology and a cloud-based positioning engine. We believe the positioning of Location Studio TM &#32;is unique in the industry and is an appealing alternative to free consumer-based mapping services which are subject to change by the supplier and which may not meet an enterprise&#8217;s privacy and security requirements. 

Government Solutions Segment 

Command and Control Technologies &#8201;- We are a key supplier to the U.S. Army for mission critical command and control technology solutions such as our Secret Internet Protocol Router and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Access Point ("SNAP") products. We are also a prime contractor under two 5-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity defense contract vehicles: the Army&#8217;s Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems ("GTACS") contract and the Defense Information Systems Agency&#8217;s Custom SATCOM Solutions ("CS2") contract. In September 2015, we were named the awardee of a competitive five-year contract extension (a base plus five option periods) to provide the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") personnel with curriculum development and training services to support cybersecurity workforce development. Additionally, we have and expect to continue to provide sustainment services to the U.S. Army for our Blue Force Tracking-1 system. 

Troposcatter Technologies &#32;- We have designed, manufactured and sold over-the-horizon microwave products and systems for approximately forty years and believe we are the leading supplier in this specialized product market. We believe we offer the only available adaptive troposcatter modem operating at 50 Mbps. Our Modular Tactical Transmission System ("MTTS") systems provide a high capacity, beyond-line-of-sight modular communications system designed for easy and rapid deployment. Our MTTS systems also offer seamless compatibility and interoperability with legacy-fielded troposcatter systems currently used by the U.S. military, including all versions of the AN/TRC-170. 

RF Power &#38; Switching Technologies - We are one of the largest independent suppliers of broadband, high-power, high-performance RF microwave amplifiers, which reproduce signals with high power and are extremely complex and critical to the performance of the systems into which they are incorporated. Many of these amplifiers are produced in-house by large companies; however, our expertise has created a cost-effective and technologically superior alternative to in-house sourcing. Some of the companies who have outsourced amplifier production to us include Rockwell Collins, Inc., Thales Group, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ("EADS"), Telephonics Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, BAE Systems PLC and Raytheon Company. Our amplifiers are also used in oncology treatment systems that allow physicians to give cancer patients higher doses of radiation that are more closely focused on cancerous tissue, thereby minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

We Believe We Provide Industry Leading Innovation, Capabilities and Solutions 

We have established a leading position of technology innovation in our fields through internal and customer-funded research and development activities, which have yielded significant advances. Examples of our industry-leading innovation include: 

Our Heights TM &#32;Networking Platform - An advanced networking platform that combines our most efficient waveforms, compression engines and the ability to provide dynamic bandwidth and power management to meet the demands of customers operating on traditional fixed satellite service systems ("FSS") while providing advantages for customers who plan to transition to high throughput satellite ("HTS") systems in the future. Our Heights TM &#32;platform, a successor to our advanced Very Small Aperture Terminal ("VSAT") series of products, is ideally suited for cellular backhaul, universal service obligation networks and other applications that require high performance in a hub-spoke environment. 

Our New Line of SuperPower TM &#32;TWTAs &#32;- In March 2015 we introduced new breakthrough Ku-band and DBS-band SuperPower TM &#32;TWTAs that can double TWTA output power and provide direct replacement for klystron power amplifiers ("KPAs") in satellite communications uplink applications. Based on positive customer reaction to this new product, we believe this innovation will drive market growth. 

Our Gallium Nitride Based Amplifiers &#8201;- These amplifiers, which incorporate Gallium Nitride ("GaN") technololgy, offer an efficient size, weight and power profile affording customers more power with higher efficiency. With continued technology evolution in the GaN semiconductor marketplace, we have successfully developed solid-state products with our GaN semiconductor partners that are achieving power levels of traditional tube amplifier products. We believe this will create opportunities to replace difficult to utilize amplifiers that use antiquated technology and are more expensive to operate. 

Our New Trusted Technology Location Solutions &#8201;- In order to determine a cellular phone user&#8217;s location, many companies utilize technology that combines wireless network-derived location data with data from the phone&#8217;s on-board global positioning system receiver. In April 2016, we were issued a U.S. patent for our Location Trust Score technology. This patent grants us important intellectual property protection and licensing opportunities for a unique process that identifies the reliability of a stated mobile location by generating a "Location Trust Score." We believe this technology is a major breakthrough in providing secure, accurate and reliable information and a powerful tool for identifying fraud, preventing "false positive" denials of service, and confirming location compliance for regulated industries. 

(4) 

We Have a Diverse Global Customer Base 

We have established longstanding relationships with hundreds of customers worldwide. Our customers include leading system and network suppliers in the global satellite, defense, broadcast and aerospace industries, as well as the U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local governments, and foreign governments. 

Our satellite earth station products and our high-power amplifiers are used by hundreds of international customers including mobile cellular network providers and governments around the world. We also have ongoing relationships with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and other government agencies. Our global commercial and government customers are increasingly seeking integrated solutions to meet their operational needs. We believe that our customers recognize our ability to develop improved technologies and to meet stringent program requirements. 

We intend to leverage relationships with our customers to introduce them to the expanded portfolio of technology solutions that resulted from the TCS acquisition. Additionally, we hope to expand relationships with U.S.-based telecommunications companies, including Verizon Wireless and AT&#38;T, (through various divisions, directly and through channels). 

We also expect the TCS acquisition will further strengthen our relationship with the U.S. government, given TCS's prime position on key contracts. Prior to the acquisition, Comtech and TCS had worked together for a number of years to offer the U.S. military a troposcatter system in a transportable flyaway configuration (known as the AN/TCS-198(V3) or SNAP-3T) which is capable of providing seamless compatibility and interoperability with legacy-fielded over-the-horizon microwave systems. Over time, we hope to utilize these prime contracts to facilitate procurement by the U.S. government for our satellite earth station and over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems, given the ever increasing amount of Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (also known as "C4ISR") information that is being generated. 

Our Two Business Segments 

Beginning with our third quarter of fiscal 2016, we began managing our business through two reportable operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. Our corporate senior management team supports the business segments by, among other things, actively seeking to exploit potential synergies that exist between the segments, including in areas such as manufacturing, technology, sales, marketing and customer support. 

In fiscal 2016, our Commercial Solutions segment contributed approximately 60.6% of our net sales and our Government Solutions segment contributed approximately 39.4% of our net sales. Additional financial information about our business segments, including net sales, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure), total assets, and our operations outside the United States, is provided in " Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (13) Segment Information " &#160; included in " Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. " 

Commercial Solutions Segment 

Overview 

Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies). 

Key Markets and Technology Solutions 

Communication Technologies &#32;- We offer communication technologies with particular expertise in the satellite communications industry, which is undergoing a period of significant growth and rapid technological change. Our Commercial Solutions segment manufactures most of the satellite-based communication equipment we sell to our customers. 

We believe that the overall satellite ground station equipment industry will grow over the next few years. This growth is expected to occur as a result of wide-sweeping deployment and upgrades of ground-based systems, including satellite earth stations, as well as integration of high-performance amplifiers used for high-performance systems and applications necessary to meet emerging demand for high-performance applications of satellite communications technologies, such as satellite-based wireless backhaul, direct to home ("DTH"), high definition ("HD") and 4K broadcasting, and in-flight connectivity. 

We believe that Comtech is well positioned to capitalize on this industry growth and change through sales of our market leading, high performance communication technologies and products, including our SCPC satellite modems, solid-state amplifiers, Heights TM &#32;Networking Platform and advanced VSAT products. Examples of end-market applications that are driving demand for our satellite-based communication technologies include: 

&#8226; 

Satellite-Based Cellular Backhaul. Demand for satellite-based cellular backhaul services is anticipated to grow rapidly as a result of the increased penetration of smart cellular phones and network upgrades to 3G and 4G in developing regions of the world. As mobile data penetration expands and mobile data consumption increases, wireless carriers must invest in their mobile network infrastructure. In developing regions of the world and in remote areas where terrestrial network infrastructure is lacking, wireless network operators often backhaul, or transport, their wireless data traffic using satellite-based networking technologies. Comtech is well positioned to serve the high-performance, high availability needs of satellite-based cellular backhaul through sales of our leading SCPC modems and solid-state amplifiers. &#32; 

&#8226; 

New High Throughput Satellites. &#32;There are literally more than 100 new High Throughput Satellites ("HTS") payloads and satellites expected to launch over the next decade which we believe is expected to lead to increasingly complex satellite networks. As service providers work to offer connectivity to these high-speed, high-bandwidth satellites and expand their networks to handle the demand for new HTS applications, we believe they will require new installations and upgrades of equipment. 

&#8226; 

High Definition and Ultra-High Definition Broadcasting. &#32;In recent years, consumers have purchased millions of High Definition televisions and Ultra-High Definition or "4K" televisions. We believe this will require a significant amount of satellite bandwidth, which is expected to require satellite service providers to upgrade equipment and find new ways to manage the cost and transmission efficiency of their networks. We believe that these requirements will drive increased demand for new SCPC-based modems, our Ka-frequency based 500 Watt TWTA, our Heights &#8482; &#32;products and our new SuperPower TM &#32;TWTAs, which can double TWTA output power and provide direct replacement for bandwidth deficient KPAs. &#32; 

&#8226; 

In-Flight Connectivity. Consumer demand for anytime, anywhere connectivity is rapidly rising. As a result, airlines worldwide are deploying in-flight connectivity and entertainment systems. The deployment of in-flight connectivity and entertainment systems by airlines around the world is creating opportunities for us to serve as a key supplier of amplifier components used for in-flight Ku-band connectivity systems. &#32; 

Safety and Security Technologies &#32;- We offer safety and security technology solutions that enable 911 call routing via cellular, over the Internet using VoIP, and across next generation technology. When someone places an emergency call using one of these technologies, our software, which is utilized by certain telecommunication carriers, can identify the call as an emergency call, accesses the user&#8217;s location information from the wireless network and route the call to the assigned public safety jurisdiction. 

We intend to continue to invest in and upgrade our 911 capabilities as we believe this market will grow from current levels. We believe our existing customer base has a need for NG911 systems, including 911 text messaging services, advanced data, real-time photos, and other types of information sharing over IP networks. In February 2015, the FCC enabled $7 billion of funding for the Commerce Department&#8217;s FirstNet, a nationwide LTE broadband network for over five million first responders, which encompasses police departments, fire departments, the National Guard, and other emergency service providers using the 700MHz spectrum. Our FirstNet opportunities include systems integration, satellite and location infrastructure terminals, and linkage to NG911 Emergency Services IP Networks ("ESInet"). 

We believe the market for NG911 will grow from current levels. As a result, we have implemented and will continue to implement pilot programs of our market leading U.S. solutions in foreign countries. Our NG911 solutions have been deployed since 2006 and are utilized by literally millions of people in more than 30 states. Key E911 capability upgrades include: Text-to-911, indoor location accuracy and multimedia messaging. 

Enterprise &#38; Trusted Location TM &#32; Technologies &#32;- We offer enterprise application technologies including location-based technology such as Trusted Location TM , Look4 TM , Indoor Location, text messaging platforms, and VirtuMedix &#174; . 

Leveraging our leading location-based technology expertise, we have developed a wide range of commercial solutions to help address mapping, routing, and geolocation to help reduce cybercrime and fraud, as well as enhance public safety. Our Trusted Location TM product is a software-based scoring system that allows providers to accurately determine mobile location and identify fraudulent behavior (e.g., location spoofing) and other security risks, including risks arising from mobile-based financial transactions. Our Look4 TM &#32;application allows customers to build their own applications that include our location-based technology. Look4 TM &#32;allows enterprise customers to offer their end-customers functionality such as maps, search, geocoding, routing and navigation using their brand. We believe that enterprise customers are increasingly looking for an alternative to free mapping services that are subject to change by the provider and may not meet the enterprise&#8217;s privacy and security requirements. 

Our Indoor Location solution enables the determination of a cell phone user&#8217;s geospatial position in environments where traditional Global Positioning System (&#8220;GPS&#8221;), global navigation satellite systems and cellular technologies do not work well (such as office buildings). The FCC has mandated that emergency services must incorporate this technology (and we believe other markets will follow) which utilizes more precise location information in mobile applications as well as in driverless cars and C4ISR systems. We provide services to support these applications, and our platform is used to provide "Connected Car" connectivity. 

Our text messaging platforms are used by wireless carriers to provide SMS to their end-customers and are also used to communicate with 911 PSAPs through major network operators. For our installed base of systems, we provide ongoing operational support, including administration of system components, system optimization, and configuration management. Maintenance services include tracking customer support issues, trouble shooting, and developing and installing maintenance releases. 

The VirtuMedix &#174; &#32;product is a new secure digital health platform that we have developed and is accessible from any device, connecting patients and providers to enable virtual healthcare. Changes in health regulations and reimbursement models have created a new market opportunity. To date, sales of this product have been nominal. 

We have begun to focus efforts to cross-sell existing Comtech international carrier customers with our new location-based services such as safety and security technologies and navigation and texting solutions. Our Trusted Location TM &#32;software, which is currently being used by commercial customers to validate a user&#8217;s precise location for purposes such as fraud prevention, also has utility in law enforcement and intelligence, including the tracking of targets and soldiers on the battlefield. Similarly, we are using the intellectual property originally developed to support the 911 call routing business to offer solutions to telehealth and telematics customers. We are focused on identifying similar opportunities across our product lines, identifying existing capabilities that can be deployed in new markets and for developing a go-to-market strategy. 

Government Solutions Segment 

Overview 

Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems. We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including telecom expense management, project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems, and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers, and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices). 

Key Markets and Technology Solutions 

Our Government Solutions segment offers integrated satellite equipment and designs, installs and operates data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links). In addition, our Government Solutions segment provides ongoing network operation and management support services including telecom expense management and project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals and related systems. 

Command &#38; Control (C4ISR) Technologies 

With persistent threats from state and non-state actors, governments seek to mitigate these threats using information to increase decision-makers&#8217; situational awareness. This information is collected through various surveillance platforms, such as radars and unmanned aerial vehicles ("UAVs"), and transferred and processed through secure communications networks. 

Comtech offers solutions to help close the security gap in an era of information-based, network-centric warfare. U.S. and foreign governments use our over-the-horizon microwave systems to, among other things, transmit radar tracking and air defense information and to connect remote border locations. We also offer satellite transceivers used by militaries to track and communicate with friendly forces, and we offer cyber security and training. Our amplifiers support high capacity U.S. military satellite systems and our narrow-band solid state amplifier products are a key component in communications systems used to support U.S. special operations forces. In addition, advanced UAVs use our integrated solid state products as part of their data link systems. U.S. and foreign military customers use our solid state amplifiers in a variety of electronic warfare systems such as jamming, broadcasting and deception in addition to simulation, communication, radar, counter measure and IFF systems. 

Moreover, governments around the world have historically allocated large portions of their defense budgets to platform-based programs - for example, the development, acquisition, operation and maintenance of aircrafts and ships. However, with increasing security threats and increasingly constrained budgets, the new capital allocation mentality in the defense industry is that incremental investment in old platform programs is seen as starving funding from data-centric investments which do more to close the security gap. Increasing focus by government agencies on the protection of their online assets has brought the importance of cybersecurity and associated solutions to the forefront. As such, we have developed a number of cybersecurity training solutions to meet the U.S. government&#8217;s surging demand for qualified personnel. We are proficient in the recruitment and development of cyber professionals and offer our Art of Exploitation training program. This training program covers a clear set of leading methodologies to produce a certified cyber professional. 

Troposcatter Technologies 

Over-the-horizon microwave systems, sometimes referred to as troposcatter systems, are extremely reliable and secure. Over-the-horizon microwave communication is a cost-effective, secure alternative to satellite communication as it does not require the leasing of expensive satellite transponder space with its attendant recurring costs. Traditional end-users of our troposcatter equipment have included the U.S. government and foreign governments that utilize our systems to, among other things, transmit radar tracking, run C4ISR applications, and connect remote border locations. Additionally, energy companies use our systems to enable communication links for offshore oil rigs and other remote locations, as well as for exploration activities. Our over-the-horizon microwave systems, which include our patented forward error correction technology, are able to transmit video and other broadband applications at throughputs of up to 50 megabits per second ("Mbps"). 

We believe the market for troposcatter technologies is poised for growth. We believe many emerging and developing countries will be required to further develop and upgrade their commercial and defense communications systems, and many of these countries lack the financial resources to install extensive land-based networks, particularly where they have large geographic areas or unfriendly terrain that make the installation of land-based networks more costly. We believe our over-the-horizon microwave technologies often provide affordable and effective solutions to meet the requirements for communications services in these countries and that long-term demand will increase. 

Our MTTS, the first truly modular, rapidly deployable transit case-based troposcatter system, which has recently been purchased by the U.S. Army, has been incorporated into the SNAP family of products used by the U.S. military and called the Tactical Transportable TROPO ("SNAP 3T") or AN/TRC 198(V3). Numerous SNAP 3T terminals have been deployed by the U.S. Army in recent years and we believe that the U.S. Army intends to deploy a significant number of units in the future. We are currently developing next generation troposcatter modems that will provide significant reductions in size, power and weight as compared to currently available models. We believe these next generation modems will facilitate further market expansion over the next several years. 

RF Power and Switching Technologies 

Our high-power solid-state amplifiers and related technologies are utilized in several critical applications including: electronic warfare, communications, radar, IFF and medical applications. We believe the demand for our RF power and switching technologies is growing. 

In the electronic warfare marketplace, we support legacy systems and are participating in the ongoing migration to platforms that require smaller and lighter amplifiers. We expect the U.S. DoD to fund initial proof of concept systems and fund production of small airborne platforms to meet the need for improved data link systems with manned and unmanned platforms. Our solutions increase the flexibility of systems by providing wider bandwidth capabilities to address communication needs. 

We also believe that the desire for increased situational awareness of the airspace may create opportunities for our radar and IFF products, which are used by government customers around the world. Our high power and highly reliable GaN amplifier technology is increasingly being used both to update existing radar systems for improved sensitivity and range as well as for new radar installations. In addition to technologies that enhance performance of primary radars, we also supply solutions for IFF systems that provide positive identification of radar targets. Governing bodies are requiring the implementation of spectrum friendly systems which, in turn, is driving market need for new hardware for our advanced performance systems. 

The medical industry is also making use of our technologies for use in oncology and hypothermic cancer treatment systems. These systems improve treatment precision, reduce marginal costs and allow for higher insurance reimbursement rates. These increased reimbursement levels are strong incentives to upgrade facilities with the latest available technologies. 

As a result of the TCS acquisition, we are able to compete for a larger number of government contracts due to our increased scale, prime contracting experience, key past performance qualifications and broader technology resources. Furthermore, TCS has historically procured modems and amplifiers used in its equipment, such as our SNAP terminals, from third parties. We are currently in the process of having our equipment certified for inclusion on these programs, which will allow us to displace existing third party providers and control and enhance overall system performance.

Acquisitions 

In the past, we have acquired businesses and enabling technologies. We have followed a disciplined approach in identifying, executing and capitalizing on these acquisitions. 

On February 23, 2016, we acquired TCS, a leading provider of commercial solutions (such as public safety systems and enterprise application technologies), and government solutions (such as command and control (C4ISR) applications.) The TCS acquisition resulted in Comtech entering complementary markets and expanding our domestic and international commercial offerings. TCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, based on audited financial results, TCS generated net sales of approximately $364.4 million. Our financial results for fiscal 2016 include approximately five months of TCS's operations and are discussed further in " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of Fiscal 2016 and 2015." 

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

Sales and marketing strategies vary with particular markets served and include direct sales through sales, marketing and engineering personnel, indirect sales through independent representatives, value-added resellers, and sales through a combination of the foregoing. We devote resources to evaluating and responding to requests for proposals by governmental agencies around the world and, as needed, we employ the use of specialized consultants to develop our proposals and bids. 

We intend to continue to expand international marketing efforts by engaging additional independent sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers and by establishing additional foreign sales offices. 

In addition, we also leverage our relationships with larger companies to market our commercial systems. These indirect sales relationships include AT&#38;T, CenturyLink, and Alcatel-Lucent. We have Cisco certifications which enhance our ability to co-sell with Cisco&#8217;s sales force. 

We are pre-qualified as an approved vendor for certain government contracts, and some of our products and services are available to government customers via the General Services Administration&#8217;s Information Technology Schedule 70, GTACS, CS2, and the Space and Naval Warfare Foreign Military Sales contract vehicles. We collaborate in sales efforts under various arrangements with integrators. Our marketing efforts also include advertising, public relations, speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences. 

Our management, technical and marketing personnel establish and maintain relationships with customers. Our sales strategies include a commitment to providing ongoing customer support for our systems and equipment. This support involves providing direct access to engineering staff or trained technical representatives to resolve technical or operational issues. 

Our products and services in many of our product lines have long sales cycles. Once a product is designed into a system, customers may be reluctant to change the incumbent supplier due to the extensive qualification process and potential redesign required in using alternative sources. In addition, in recent years, we have found that overall sales cycles for each of our product lines have significantly increased. 

Sales by geography and customer type, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, are as follows:

Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the DoD, intelligence and civilian agencies such as Homeland Security and the General Services Administration, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. 

Domestic sales include sales to U.S state and local governments. 

International sales include sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers. International sales for fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;(which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) were $123.5 million , $172.7 million &#32;and $206.0 million , respectively. When we sell internationally, we denominate virtually all of our contracts in U.S. dollars. Some of our sales to international customers are paid for by letters of credit or on an open account. From time to time, some of our international customers may require us to provide performance guarantees. 

For fiscal 2016, except for the U.S. government, no customer or individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales. For fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , sales to a U.S. prime contractor customer represented approximately 1.8% , 13.5% &#32;and 15.4% , respectively, of consolidated net sales. Almost all of those sales relate to our North African country end-customer. 

As a result of the TCS acquisition, we believe that international sales as a percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods will be significantly lower than our historical results, and U.S. domestic sales as a percentage of our consolidated revenues in future periods will increase as compared to historical results. This expected change is driven by the inclusion in consolidated net sales of safety and security technology solutions (such as 911 call routing) which are primarily sold to U.S. domestic customers. 

Backlog 

Our backlog as of July 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $484.0 million &#32;and $117.7 million , respectively. We expect that a significant portion of the backlog as of July 31, 2016 &#32;will be recognized as sales during fiscal 2017 . 

At July 31, 2016 , 23.4% &#32;of our backlog consisted of U.S. government contracts, subcontracts and government funded programs, 15.8% &#32;consisted of orders for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) and 60.8% &#32;consisted of orders for use by U.S. commercial customers. 

Our backlog consists of orders that we believe to be firm; however, almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to modification, cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. Backlog that is derived from U.S. government orders relates to U.S. government contracts that have been awarded, signed and funded. Backlog for our U.S. government customers also includes amounts appropriated by Congress and allotted to the contract by the procuring government agency. Our backlog does not include the value of options that may be exercised in the future on multi-year contracts, nor does it include the value of additional purchase orders that we may receive under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts or basic ordering agreements. 

In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month&#8217;s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. 

There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised. 

Variations in backlog from time to time are attributable, in part, to changes in sales mix, the timing of contract proposals, and the timing of contract awards and delivery schedules on specific contracts. A large majority of the solutions in our communication technologies product line operate under short lead times. Our Government Solutions segment backlog is highly influenced by the nature and timing of orders received from the U.S. government, which is subject to unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions. As a result, we believe our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the total sales anticipated for any particular future period. 

Manufacturing and Service 

Our manufacturing operations consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic products that we design and build from purchased fabricated parts, printed circuits and electronic components. We consider our facilities to be well maintained and adequate for current and planned production requirements. All of our manufacturing facilities, including those that serve the military market, must comply with stringent customer specifications. We employ formal quality management programs and other training programs, including the International Standard Organization&#8217;s quality procedure registration programs. 

We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. This manufacturing center is operated by our Commercial Solutions segment and can be utilized, in part, by our Government Solutions segment and by third-party commercial customers, including prime contractors to the U.S. government, who can outsource a portion of their product manufacturing to us. Increased usage of our high-volume technology manufacturing center allows us to secure volume discounts on key components, better control the quality of our manufacturing process and maximize the utilization of our manufacturing capacity. 

Our ability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis is dependent, in part, upon the availability and timely delivery by subcontractors and suppliers (including, at times, the U.S. government) of the components and subsystems that we use in manufacturing our products. Electronic components and raw materials used in our products are generally obtained from independent suppliers. Some components are standard items and are available from a number of suppliers. Others are manufactured to our specifications by subcontractors. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and equipment are available from multiple sources. Certain U.S. government contracts may require us to incorporate government furnished parts into our products. Delays in receipt of such parts can adversely impact the timing of our performance on the related contracts. 

Research and Development 

We have established a leading technology position in our fields through internal and customer-funded research and development activities. 

Internal research and development expenses are reported as research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes and were $42.2 &#32;million, $35.9 &#32;million and $34.1 &#32;million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, representing 10.3% , 11.7% &#32;and 9.8% &#32;of total consolidated net sales, respectively, for these periods. Customer-funded research and development activities relate to the adaptation of our basic technology to specialized customer requirements which is recoverable under contracts and is reflected in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales. Certain of our government customers contract with us from time to time to conduct research on telecommunications software, equipment and systems. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we were reimbursed by customers for such activities in the amounts of $17.4 &#32;million, $9.2 &#32;million and $13.1 &#32;million (of which $7.3 million related to the Advanced Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA") Interface Processor ("ATIP") development), respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, continuing technological innovation and, with respect to certain technologies, patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. The products we sell require significant engineering design and manufacturing expertise. For these technological capabilities that are not protected by patents or licenses, we generally rely on the expertise of our employees and our learned experiences in both the design and manufacture of our products and the delivery of our services. 

Some of our key Commercial Solutions segment technology is protected by patents that are significant to protecting our proprietary technology. We have been issued several U.S. patents relating to forward error correction technology that is utilized in our TPC-enabled satellite modems. Due to our market leadership position, we do not expect that upon expiration of these patents, our future results will be negatively impacted. Our DoubleTalk &#174; &#32;Carrier-in-Carrier &#174; &#32;bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party. 

In connection with the TCS acquisition, we acquired a portfolio of several hundred patents worldwide relating to wireless location-based services, text messaging, GPS ephemeris data, emergency public safety data routing, electronic commerce, and other areas. Our patent portfolio allows us to build meaningful partnerships with other companies through direct licensing, cross licensing, and other forms of agreements. Our commitment to protecting our intellectual property ensures continued differentiation and freedom to operate in the industry. We do not believe that any single patent or group of patents, patent application or patent license agreement is material to the Company&#8217;s operations. 

We have filed additional patent applications for certain apparatus and processes we believe we have invented covering key features of the location services, wireless text alerts, SMS Center, mobile-originated data and E911 network software. There is no assurance that our patent applications will result in a patent being issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other patent offices, nor is there any guarantee that any issued patent will be valid and enforceable. Additionally, foreign patent rights may or may not be available or pursued in any technology area for which U.S. patent applications have been filed. 

Almost all of the products and services we sell to the U.S. government include technology and other technical know-how that we have internally developed. In past instances where we have provided government-purpose rights, to our knowledge, the U.S. government has not exercised any of these rights. To the extent that we have provided or will provide government-purpose rights in the future, we believe that given the rapidly changing nature of our technology, our future success will depend primarily on the technical competence and creative skill of our personnel, rather than any contractual protection. 

Competition 

Our businesses are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have significantly greater financial, marketing, research and development, technological and operating resources and broader product lines than we have. Other companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including new companies, our existing competitors and our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our growth and financial condition depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. 

Some large defense-based companies, such as Northrop Grumman Corporation, have subsidiaries or divisions that compete against us in one or more business segments. In addition, new and potential competitors are always emerging. Certain of our customers, such as prime contractors who currently outsource their engineering and manufacturing requirements to us, have technological capabilities in our product areas and could choose to replace our products with products they develop. In some cases, we partner or team with companies (both large and mid-tier) to compete against other teams for large defense programs. In some cases, these same companies may be among our competitors. 

Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some of our competitors in each of our two business segments: 

Commercial Solutions &#32;- Airbus DS Communications, Advantech Wireless Inc., CalAmp Corp., COM Dev International Ltd. (a subsidiary of Honeywell, Inc.), Comverse Technology Inc., CPI International, Inc., Datum Systems, Inc., 8x8 Inc., Emergency CallWorks, Ericsson LM Telephone Co., Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd., Gogo Inc., Google Inc., Harris Corporation, iDirect, Inc., Intermap Technologies Corp., Iridium Communications Inc., KVH Industries Inc., Newtec, Nokia Networks, NovelSat, Orbcomm, Inc., Paradise Datacom LLC (a subsidiary of Teledyne Corporation), Solacom Technologies Inc., Telenav, Inc., ViaSat, Inc., West Corporation and Xura, Inc. 

Government Solutions &#32;- Aethercomm, Inc., CACI International Inc., CalAmp Corp., Computer Sciences Corporation, DB Control Corp. (a subsidiary of HEICO Corp.), E2V Technologies Ltd., Empower RF Systems, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Harris Corporation, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Mercury Systems, Inc., NeuStar, Inc., The KEYW Holding Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Orbital ATK, Inc., Teledyne Technologies, Ultra Electronics Herley Industries (a division of Ultra Electronics Holdings PLC) and ViaSat, Inc. 

We believe that competition in all of our markets is based primarily on technology innovation, product performance, reputation, delivery times, customer support and price. Due to our proprietary know-how, we believe we have the ability to develop, produce and deliver products and services on a cost-effective basis faster than many of our competitors. 

Employees 

At July 31, 2016 , we had 2,031 employees (including temporary employees and contractors), 1,259 of whom were engaged in production and production support, 425 in research and development and other engineering support, and 347 in marketing and administrative functions. None of our U.S. based employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

U.S. Government Contracts and Security Clearances 

The U.S. government operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Generally, in February of each year, the President of the United States presents to the U.S. Congress ("Congress") the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year and from February through September of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of Congress review the President&#8217;s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies. Thereafter, we can receive orders pursuant to sole-source or competitively awarded contracts, which we describe below. 

The U.S. government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of any given government fiscal year and when the fiscal budget is not approved in a timely manner, the U.S. government is required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a so-called "continuing resolution" that authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we provide. 

Sole-source contracts are generally awarded to a single contractor without a formal competition when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology superior to that of competing contractors or when there is an urgent need by the U.S. government that cannot wait for a full competitive process. Potential suppliers compete informally through research and development and marketing efforts. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded based on a formal proposal evaluation established by the procuring agency and interested contractors prepare bids. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers. 

The U.S. government has a stated policy direction to reduce the number of sole-source contract awards across all procuring agencies. In addition, the U.S. government is increasing the use of multiple-award IDIQ contracts to increase its procurement options. IDIQ contracts allow the U.S. government to select a group of eligible contractors for the same program. When the government awards IDIQ contracts to multiple bidders under the same program, a company that has already competed to be selected as a participant in the program must subsequently compete for individual delivery orders. As a result of this U.S. government shift toward multiple award IDIQ contracts, we expect to face greater competition for future U.S. government contracts and, at the same time, greater opportunities for us to participate in program areas that we do not currently participate in. 

As a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are subject to a variety of rules and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"). Individual agencies can also have acquisition regulations. For example, the Department of Defense implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation supplement (commonly known as "DFARs"). For all Federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including: acquisition planning, competition requirements, contractor qualifications, protection of source selection and vendor information, and acquisition procedures. In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of supplier costs, while Cost Accounting Standards address how those costs can be allocated to contracts. The FAR also subjects suppliers to audits and other government reviews. These reviews cover issues such as cost, performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts. The government may challenge a supplier's costs and fees. Suppliers are also required to comply with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual which relates to requirements regarding classified materials and programs. Suppliers who do not comply with these various regulations may lose and/or become ineligible for facility security clearances and/or participation in classified programs. 

Under firm fixed-price contracts, we perform for an agreed-upon price and we can derive benefits from cost savings, but bear the risk of cost overruns. Our cost-reimbursable type contracts typically provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a negotiated fee. Cost-plus-incentive-fee orders typically provide for sharing with the U.S. government savings accrued from orders performed for less than the target costs and costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), and for the supplier to carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. 

In fiscal 2016 , $167.5 million &#32;or 40.8% &#32;of our consolidated net sales were to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government). Of this amount, firm fixed-price and cost-reimbursable type contracts (including both fixed-fee and incentive-fee type contracts) accounted for approximately $123.3 million &#32;and $44.2 million , respectively. Of the net sales in fiscal 2016 &#32;related to firm fixed-price and cost-reimbursable type contracts, $12.2 million &#32;and $13.1 million , respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment's BFT-1 sustainment contract. Since fiscal 2014, we have performed work on our ATIP contract for which we have received aggregate funded orders of $33.5 million &#32;to date, a majority of which are cost-plus-incentive-fee orders. 

Regulatory Matters 

In addition to the rules and regulations that pertain to us as a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations. 

Our products that are incorporated into wireless communications systems must comply with various government regulations, including those of the FCC. Our manufacturing facilities, which may store, handle, emit, generate and dispose of hazardous substances that are used in the manufacture of our products, are subject to a variety of local, state and federal regulations, including those issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Our products are also subject to European Union directives related to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. 

Our international sales are subject to U.S. and foreign regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). If we are unable to receive appropriate export authorizations in the future, we may be prohibited from selling our products and services internationally, which may limit our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other local laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could further restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. 

In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC") and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance. 

In October 2014, we self-disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a routine assessment of the adequacy of our export control compliance procedures that we had inadvertently neglected to obtain an OFAC license for a shipment of modems to a Canadian customer who, we learned after the transaction had begun, intended to incorporate our modems in a communication system the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly in Sudan and from facilitating transactions by non-U.S. persons which would be illegal if done by a U.S. person. In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena to us seeking further information about the previously voluntarily disclosed transaction and any other transactions involving Sudan. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech&#8217;s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon after which time the modems were rerouted to Sudan without Comtech&#8217;s knowledge. OFAC has not responded to our submission of further information and we cannot predict when the agency will complete its review and determine whether any violations occurred. See " Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business-Our international sales and operations are subject to risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses, and such failure would materially adversely affect our operations ." 

Our financial reporting, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices are governed by laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and rules and regulations issued by the SEC. The SEC has adopted rules which require, among other things, public companies to conduct certain inquiries to determine whether or not Conflict Minerals (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) that are necessary to the functionality of their manufactured products or their product's production processes originated in a Covered Country (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) and ultimately file a report with the SEC. Conflict Minerals are widely used in many industries, including the telecommunications industry and almost all of our products include component parts purchased from third party suppliers and we must rely heavily on information received from suppliers to determine the origin of those materials. We have implemented a due diligence program consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines to collect information concerning the country of origin of Conflict Minerals and in that regard, have adopted a policy that requires our suppliers (both public and private) to commit to a code of conduct relating to the responsible sourcing of minerals and to establish a policy to reasonably assure that the products they manufacture do not contain Conflict Minerals that originated in a Covered Country. Efforts to comply with this SEC rule have resulted in additional costs to us and, we believe, to our suppliers. As such, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.
