&#160; 

Overview of Business 

&#160; 

MedeFile International, Inc., through its MedeFile, Inc. subsidiary, has developed and globally markets a proprietary, patient-centric, Internet-enabled Personal Health Record (pier) system for gathering, digitizing, maintaining, accessing and sharing an individual&#8217;s actual medical records. MedeFile's goal is to revolutionize the medical industry by bringing patient-centric digital technology to the business of medicine. MedeFile intends to accomplish its objective by providing individuals with a simple and secure way to access their lifetime of actual medical records in an efficient and cost-effective manner. MedeFile's products and services are designed to provide healthcare providers with the ability to reference their patient's actual past medical records, thereby ensuring the most accurate treatment and services possible while simultaneously reducing redundant procedures. 

&#160; 

Interoperable with most electronic medical record systems utilized by physician practices, clinics, hospitals and other care providers, the highly secure, feature-rich MedeFile iPHR solution has been designed to gather all of its members&#8217; actual medical records on behalf of each member, and create a single, comprehensive, electronic Personal Health Record (PHR). The member can access his/her records 24-hours a day, seven days a week &#8211; or authorize a third party user &#8211; on any web-enabled device (PC, cell phone, PDA, e-reader, et al), as well as the portable MedeDrive flash drive/keychain or branded UBS-bracelet. 

&#160; 

By subscribing to the MedeFile system, members empower themselves to take control of their own health and well-being, and empower their healthcare providers to make sound and lifesaving decisions with the most accurate, up-to-date medical information available. In addition, with MedeFile, members benefit from knowing that their medical records are protected from fire, natural disaster, document misplacement or the closing of a medical or dental practice. 

&#160; 

MedeFile believes it enjoys a number of direct, competitive advantages over others in the medical records marketplace, including that: 

&#160; 

&#9679; &#160; MedeFile has developed products and services geared to the patient, which also have the depth and breadth of information required by treating physicians and medical personnel. &#9679; &#160; MedeFile does all the work of collecting and updating medical information on an ongoing basis; our products&#8217; dependence on the patient taking action is minimal &#8211; particularly when compared to patient action required to support competing solutions. &#9679; &#160; MedeFile provides a complete medical record. Other companies claim complete longitudinal records, but in reality only provide histories (usually completed by the member/patient), and are by no means complete or necessarily accurate records. &#9679; &#160; MedeFile provides a coherent mix of services and products that are intended to improve the quality of healthcare by enabling the patient to manage and access the information normally retained by doctors and other care providers. &#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Since the beginning of modern medicine, information about a patient's history, testing, treatment and care have been key factors in the provision and delivery of quality healthcare. Medical record information takes many forms, such as the patient's diagnosis, treatments, surgeries, medications, allergies, x-rays, and test results. The usage of medical record information has dramatically increased over the past two decades due to factors such as the complex reimbursement structure in the United States healthcare system, an ever more litigious society, and increased patient awareness. 

&#160; 

Every patient visit generates a medical record. Today, this information is largely contained in a paper-based patient medical record. A patient's medical records are usually stored in physicians' offices as well as other healthcare facilities the patient has visited. A record that tracks a patient's medical treatment over time is called a &#8220;longitudinal record.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In today's healthcare environment, access to hospital-based medical records by patients and other authorized parties (e.g., insurance companies, attorneys, etc.) is controlled by Release of Information (ROI) policies and procedures. ROI processes are based on the premise that patients have a right to access their medical records and that they must specifically designate any other party to whom their medical information can be released. ROI policies and procedures are based on the following laws and policies: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), various state laws, and the policies and professional practice guidelines set forth by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). 

&#160; 

Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability &#38; Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996. The purpose of HIPAA is to prevent fraud in the healthcare industry and to protect confidential patient information. HIPAA standardizes and provides enforcement mechanisms for ROI rules and guidelines to protect personal healthcare information. HIPAA effects entities involved with electronic health care information--including health care providers, health plans, employers, public health authorities, life insurers, clearinghouses, billing agencies, information systems vendors, service organizations, universities, and even single-physician offices. The final version of the HIPAA Privacy regulations was issued in December 2000, and went into effect on April 14, 2001. A two-year &#34;grace&#34; period was included; enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Rules began on April 14, 2003. 

&#160; 

In addition, in 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) legislation was created to stimulate the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and supporting technology in the United States. President Obama signed HITECH into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), an economic stimulus bill. The HITECH Act continues the effort of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to encourage movement to electronic patient records and to deliver stricter data protection regulations for more secure patient privacy. The HITECH act stipulates that, beginning in 2011, healthcare providers will be offered financial incentives for demonstrating meaningful use of electronic health records (EHR). Incentives will be offered until 2015, after which time penalties may be levied for failing to demonstrate such use. The Act also establishes grants for training centers for the personnel required to support a health IT infrastructure.

Overview of Products and Services 

&#160; 

MedeFile iPHR 

&#160; 

MedeFile is a Business-to-Business and a Business-to-Consumer subscription service. MedeFile is designed to create a &#34;cradle to grave&#34; longitudinal record for each of its members by retrieving and consolidating copies of their medical records. When the records are received, the MedeFile system consolidates them into a single medically correct format. The records are then stored in MedeFile's MedeVault, a secure repository that can be accessed by MedeFile members 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Because of the unique security procedures incorporated into the MedeFile system through SecuroMed, the member is the only person to access or give permission to access their records. 

&#160; 

A complete MedeFile iPHR is comprised of copies of the member's actual medical records as well as a Digital Health Profile (DHP), which is an overview of the patient's and his family's medical history. In addition, every Premium MedeFile member and MedeOne member receives a MedeDrive, an external USB drive which stores all of a patient's Emergency Medical Information as well as a copy of the member's MedeFile. 

&#160; 

MedeFile's Emergency Medical Information (EMI) Card 

&#160; 

Upon becoming a MedeFile member, each individual will receive a Membership / Emergency Medical Information (EMI) Card which contains instructions on how to contact MedeFile in order to retrieve the member's medical records. 

&#160; 

The Digital Health Profile (DHP) 

&#160; 

A part of a member's MedeFile is their Digital Health Profile (DHP). This form is completed by the patient in order to provide a summary of the patient's healthcare history which assists healthcare providers in understanding the patient's course of medical treatment. This document, along with Advanced Directives and medical record copies, complete the documents contained in the patient's MedeFile. 

&#160; 

MedeDrive 

&#160; 

The MedeDrive is an external USB drive which stores all of a patient's Emergency Medical Information and their MedeFile which can be viewed on a personal computer. MedeDrive self loads its own viewer, so no special program or software is required. The MedeDrive easily plugs into any PC USB port on most Windows-based computers built in the last four years. (Macintosh version is currently unavailable). The MedeDrive USB key can be updated easily and as frequently as the member desires at no additional cost. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

MedeVault 

&#160; 

The MedeVault is designed to serve as an electronic data and document repository that incorporates state-of-the-art security features in order to prevent unauthorized access to a patient's records. Access to the MedeVault is provided through an encrypted connection to a web service run by MedeFile. This connection is provided by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 

&#160; 

MedeMinder 

&#160; 

MedeMinder is MedeFile&#8217;s reminder service. The member tells us when and where to call, and we automatically contact the member day or night with an appropriate reminder, spoken by real people. The member can even choose the voice they want to hear. MedeMinder helps insure the member will not miss an appointment or forget to take their medication. 

&#160; 

SecurMed 

&#160; 

SecurMed is designed to serve as an authentication process that protects against any information being viewed by unauthorized persons. 

&#160; 

Quality of Care Program 

&#160; 

MedeFile&#8217;s Quality of Care Program is a unique marketing initiative providing for MedeFile to partner on a revenue-sharing basis with established medical practitioners, physician groups and hospitals to educate patients on the benefits and advantages of adopting the MedeFile system as their Personal Health Record solution. Studies have shown that consumers are more interested in adopting a PHR offered by their healthcare provider than any other source. 

&#160; 

MedeFile believes that its iPHR platform can serve as a highly effective patient portal and practice integration tool that addresses the need for practitioners to meet Stage 2 &#8220;meaningful use&#8221; standards required for qualifying for federal incentive payments pursuant to the HITECH Act. Stage 2 of the HITECH Act, which begins October 2012, stipulates that 20% of the patient populations of eligible providers must have the ability to electronically view and download their health information &#8211; including diagnostic test results, physician&#8217;s notes, medication lists and medication allergies, via a web-based portal within 36 hours of being seen by the eligible providers. With the Quality of Care Program, healthcare providers can establish an elevated patient-centric standard of care and economically benefit from increased clinical efficiencies, government &#8220;meaningful use&#8221; incentives and their financial stake in the successful marketing of MedeFile&#8217;s iPHR solution to their patient populations. 

&#160; 

MedePro 

&#160; 

Introduced in 2012, MedePro is a medical record retrieval and document management solution created specifically by MedeFile for legal and insurance professionals. 

&#160; 

For Legal Professionals 

&#160; 

Medical record retrieval and document management play critical roles in helping plaintiff or defense counsels build, support and win their cases, be them mass tort, malpractice, personal injury, product liability, workers&#8217; compensation or other types of health- or medical-related litigation. However, the sheer cost, manpower and time required to request, retrieve and manage what is typically hundreds, if not thousands, of records can be overwhelming. Upon engagement, MedeFile&#8217;s highly competent MedePRO customer service agents and our proprietary electronic retrieval system go to work contacting case-related healthcare providers nationwide to collect copies of all actual medical records and files &#8211; including actual notes, EKGs, X-rays, MRIs, labs, et al. Then, using a secure, double encrypted process, MedeFile consolidates, digitizes, indexes, paginates, Bates stamps, stores and protects the records in the MedeVault, MedeFile&#8217;s proprietary, highly secure, redundant electronic depository which can only be accessed by authorized individuals. 

&#160; 

Retrieved medical records can be searched and viewed online through MedeFile&#8217;s secure online portal from anywhere on Earth using an Internet-enabled desktop computer or mobile computing device. In addition, individual and/or collective documents can also be downloaded, shared with co-counsels (essential for large mass tort cases), and copied to a MedeDrive, a proprietary USB thumb drive ideal for portability and convenient and economical long term storage. 

&#160; 

The MedePRO solution may also be seamlessly integrated into a law firm&#8217;s case management system to facilitate real-time, one-click status checks of requested records, helping to expedite case discovery and complex trial preparation. 

&#160; 

For Insurance Professionals 

&#160; 

In collaboration with medical insurance providers and with proper authorization, MedePRO enables the expeditious, secure retrieval and management of all actual medical records and files from a patient&#8217;s current and former care providers. Records received are then digitized, indexed, coded and stored in the MedeVault, from which case managers can access, view, share and download a patient&#8217;s comprehensive, longitudinal personal health record from any web-enabled device. Further, MedePRO&#8217;s online record order tracking system allows case managers to view real-time status reports on a 24/7 basis. Insurance professionals can also tap the power and convenience of MedePRO for the purpose of analyzing medical claims or investigating and adjudicating medical identity theft and fraud. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Members 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, MedeFile had approximately 21,991 members. The Company&#8217;s marketing strategy includes issuing trial memberships on several levels. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

MedeFile employs the following marketing strategies to generate awareness of MedeFile's products and services: direct sales, direct mail, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements by MedeFile's executive officers, participation in trade shows, and alliances and partnerships with third parties. 

&#160; 

MedeFile's marketing strategy will target the following types of organizations: Health Maintenance Organizations; Preferred Provider Organizations; law practices, managed care organizations; insurance companies; trade unions; large affinity groups, such as AARP; large and medium-sized self-insured corporations; nursing homes and assisted living facilities; and Internet users. 

&#160; 

In particular, the MedeFile service is designed to be sold in several distinct ways: 

&#160; 

&#9679; &#160; MedeFile&#8217;s website &#160;- Through normal e-commerce mechanisms, patients may enroll in the service directly from the MedeFile website. Membership may be purchased on an annual basis and may be paid all at once or over time, at the patient's discretion. &#9679; &#160; Physician referrals &#160;- Patients may enroll based on a doctor's referral. In the event that these physicians are also MedeFile Quality of Care Program customers, they may easily transfer their patients' information into the MedeFile system. &#9679; &#160; Large group offerings (e.g. AARP, trade unions, etc.) &#160;- Large, membership-driven organizations may offer the MedeFile system to their members at a discounted rate, which may be negotiated with MedeFile based on the size of the expected enrollment. An additional promotional advantage may be derived from the use of MedeFile through the website of the client organization. Hence, MedeFile functionality may be accessed using each organization's site. &#9679; &#160; Insurance companies &#160;- Similar to large group offerings identified above, insurance companies may offer the MedeFile service to their insured as a means to decrease the cost of medical care. &#9679; &#160; Law firms and insurance companies &#160;&#8211; law firms and insurance companies may engage MedeFile&#8217;s MedePro service for the purpose of retrieving medical records and managing documents in association with case preparation and management. &#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

MedeFile will use and continue to update the most advanced security measures available. Data transmitted between Web browsers and Web servers over the Internet using TCP/IP is generally susceptible to unauthorized interception. To protect sensitive data, the most common method of protection is data encryption. MedeFile will use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is a mechanism to secure Internet traffic so that it cannot be intercepted. SSL utilizes digital certificates to verify the identity and integrity of a web site (such as MedeFile) and to protect the security of transactions by certifying their source and destination. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There are other companies working in the medical information technology arena such as GE Healthcare, Bio-Imaging Technologies, and Cyber Records. Some competing companies offer a USB key for medical record storage, but require the customer to provide or &#34;self-populate&#34; the information to be stored. The information in a self-populated record is limited and is only as accurate as the individual's memory and understanding of their health condition. Other companies expect each customer to obtain their own medical records from their various healthcare providers. Some offer a CD-Rom for record storage. Usually, the CD-Rom cannot be updated with any changes to an individual's medical status or treatment. Therefore, a new CD-Rom needs to be obtained from that company in order for the individual to have the most current, accurate information regarding their health. There are companies that are solely web-based that do not provide the customer the capability to have a copy of their records. In this case, an Internet connection is required to view stored documents. In addition, there are companies that do not concentrate on digitizing an individual's medical records but on converting medical facilities' records from paper to electronic format. 

&#160; 

The advantage to being a MedeFile member is that MedeFile gathers, consolidates, organizes and securely stores each member's actual medical records on their behalf. The MedeFile membership includes a Digital Health Profile (DHP) which contains the member's general health history, emergency contacts, doctor contacts, family medical history, allergies, medications, and current conditions. A MedeFile membership also includes a MedeDrive which easily plugs into any PC USB port on most Windows-based computers built in the last four years. (Macintosh version is currently unavailable). The MedeDrive contains the member's emergency medical information that can be easily accessed by emergency care personnel, and the client's actual medical records which are stored in a secure area of the subscriber's MedeFile. The MedeDrive USB key can be updated easily and as frequently as the member desires at no additional cost. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

From our inception through the period ended December 31, 2015, we have primarily relied on the services of outside consultants. As of December 31, 2015, MedeFile had a total of 3 full time employees and 3 consultants. We believe our relations with our employees are favorable.
