 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

HISTORY 

New York Global Innovations Inc. (formerly known as InkSure Technologies Inc.) was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada, but reincorporated in Delaware in 2003 (together with its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;). Until February 28, 2014, we developed, marketed and sold customized authentication solutions designed to enhance the security of documents and branded products to meet the growing demand for protection from counterfeiting. Since the closing of the sale of substantially all of our assets, or the Asset Sale, on February 28, 2014, or the Closing, the Company no longer has any operating business. 

ASSET SALE 

On October 1, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended, or APA, with Spectra Systems Corporation, or Spectra. Pursuant to the terms of the APA, Spectra has acquired at the Closing substantially all of the assets of the Company, with certain exclusions described below. 

In consideration for the acquisition of assets pursuant to the APA, Spectra paid the Company $840,684, plus Spectra&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s joint good faith estimate of the closing date inventory value on the closing date. Spectra also paid the Company the following post-Closing conditional payments: 

&#183; 

$185,000 in post-closing conditional payments depending on orders placed by a former customer and agreements to be entered into with a separate customer assigned to Spectra; 

&#160;

&#183; 

$200,000, which was deposited with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and held in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement to secure the Company&#8217;s obligations to pay Spectra any indemnification claims for a period of up to one year after the date of the Closing; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

$134,000, an amount equal to 50% of all pre-closing accounts receivable collected after the Closing. 

&#160;

In addition, as a result of the closing of the sale of our assets, the Company&#8217;s former President and Chief Executive Officer, Tal Gilat, received 5% of the net proceeds of the net consideration received by the Company. 

On February 28, 2014, the Company and Spectra entered into a further amendment to the APA to acknowledge and make certain agreements as to the allocation of the payments of the purchase price to be made under the APA. 

In connection with the Closing, we changed our name from InkSure Technologies Inc. to New York Global Innovations Inc. 

USE OF PROCEEDS OF ASSET SALE 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors is exploring strategic alternatives to deploy the proceeds of the Asset Sale, which may include future acquisitions, a merger with another company, or other actions to redeploy capital, including, without limitation, the sale of the public shell company into which the net proceeds may be retained. 

Although the Board of Directors and management have had preliminary discussions regarding potential uses of our capital following the Asset Sale, the Board of Directors intends to continue to review anticipated liabilities and potential strategic uses of capital in connection with the continuation of the Company. Accordingly, we cannot specify with certainty the amount of net proceeds, if any, we will use for any particular use or the timing in respect thereof. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FORMER BUSINESS 

&#160;

During the first two months of 2014, our products were based on three principal technologies: 

&#183; 

Unique chemical markers incorporated into security holograms. 

&#183; 

Customizable security inks that are suitable for almost every type of digital and impact printing on a wide variety of surfaces or substrates (e.g., paper documents, plastic identification cards, packaging materials and labels). Some chemical markers can also be incorporated into volume liquids such as fuel. 

&#183; 

Sophisticated &#8220;full-spectrum&#8221; readers that use proprietary software to quickly analyze marks inserted into the hologram or printed with our specialty inks. 

&#160;

We conducted most of our research and development activities through our subsidiary, InkSure Ltd. Our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $ 0 , compared with $48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

As described above, we sold all of the assets associated with these products to Spectra and do not currently have any business operations. 

&#160;

We have sustained significant losses in recent periods, which has resulted in a significant reduction in our cash reserves. As a result of the Asset Sale, the Company no longer has revenue producing operations. The Company believes that it will continue to experience losses and increased negative working capital and negative cash flows in the near future and will not be able to return to positive cash flow without obtaining additional financing in the near term or the completing of a business transaction. The Company has and will experience difficulties accessing the equity and debt markets and raising such capital, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms or at all find a suitable business transaction. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities or a business transaction is concluded, the Company&#8217;s existing stockholders will experience significant further dilution. In order to conserve the Company&#8217;s cash and manage its liquidity, the Company has implemented cost-cutting initiatives including the reduction of employee headcount and overhead costs. 

PRESENT BUSINESS 

The Company is currently seeking an acquisition or merger candidate. 

Shell Company Status 

Based on the lack of Company business activities since the closing of the Asset Sale, our Company is classified as a &#8220;shell&#8221; company by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The term shell company means a Company that has: 

(1) No or nominal operations; and 

(2) Either: 

(i) No or nominal assets; 

(ii) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or 

(iii) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. 

Searching for Business Combination Candidate 

The Company is undercapitalized. We are seeking a business combination candidate that would bring revenue and/or asset value to the Company. A business combination candidate would most probably be a private company that seeks to become a publicly traded company through a business combination transaction with a publicly held and quoted company. Often times these business combination transactions are termed &#8220;reverse mergers&#8221; or &#8220;reverse acquisitions&#8221; whereby the private company acquires controlling interest in the publicly held company. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Relevant Factors 

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company&#8217;s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. 

No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company. 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has no employees.
