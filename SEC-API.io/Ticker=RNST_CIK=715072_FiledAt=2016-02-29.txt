 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Renasant Corporation (referred to herein as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), a Mississippi corporation incorporated in 1982, owns and operates Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking association with operations in Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida and Georgia, and Renasant Insurance, Inc., a Mississippi corporation with operations in Mississippi. Renasant Insurance, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renasant Bank. Renasant Bank is referred to herein as the &#8220;Bank&#8221; and Renasant Insurance, Inc. is referred to herein as &#8220;Renasant Insurance.&#8221; 

Our vision is to be the financial services advisor and provider of choice in each community we serve. With this vision in mind, management has organized the branch banks into community banks using a franchise concept. The franchise approach empowers community bank presidents to execute their own business plans in order to achieve our vision. Specific performance measurement tools are available to assist these presidents in determining the success of their plan implementation. A few of the ratios used in measuring the success of their business plan include: 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

return on average assets 

&#8212; 

net interest margin and spread 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

the efficiency ratio 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

fee income shown as a percentage of loans and deposits 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

loan and deposit growth 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

the number and type of services provided per household 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

net charge-offs to average loans 

&#8212; 

&#160; 

the percentage of loans past due and nonaccruing 

While we have preserved decision-making at a local level, we have centralized our legal, accounting, investment, risk management, loan review, human resources, audit and data processing/operations functions. The centralization of these processes enables us to maintain consistent quality of these functions and achieve certain economies of scale. 

Our vision is further validated through our core values. These values include (1) employees are our greatest assets, (2) quality is not negotiable and (3) clients&#8217; trust is foremost. Centered on these values was the development of five different objectives that are the focal point of our strategic plan. Those objectives include: (1) client satisfaction and development, (2) financial soundness and profitability, (3) growth, (4) employee satisfaction and development and (5) shareholder satisfaction and development. 

Members of our Board of Directors also serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Bank. Responsibility for the management of our Bank remains with the Board of Directors and officers of the Bank; however, management services rendered by the Company to the Bank are intended to supplement internal management and expand the scope of banking services normally offered by the Bank. 

Definitive Merger Agreement with KeyWorth Bank 

On October 20, 2015, the Company and KeyWorth Bank (&#8220;KeyWorth&#8221;), a Georgia state bank headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which the Company will acquire KeyWorth in an all stock merger in a transaction valued at approximately $58.7 million. Under the terms of the agreement, KeyWorth will be merged with and into Renasant Bank, with Renasant Bank continuing as the surviving institution in the merger. According to the terms of the merger agreement, each KeyWorth common shareholder will have the right to receive 0.4494 shares of Renasant common stock for each share of KeyWorth common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Holders of options and warrants to acquire shares of KeyWorth common stock will receive cash in an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between $15.00 and the exercise price of the option or warrant, as applicable. The merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for KeyWorth shareholders. 

The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 and is subject to KeyWorth shareholder approval and other customary conditions set forth in the merger agreement. 

KeyWorth operates six offices in the Atlanta metropolitan area and as of December 31, 2015, had approximately $407.8 million in total assets, which included approximately $252.1 million in total loans, and approximately $355.1 million in total deposits. 

Acquisition of Heritage Financial Group, Inc. 

On July 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition by merger of Heritage Financial Group, Inc. (&#8220;Heritage&#8221;), a bank holding company headquartered in Albany, Georgia, and the parent of HeritageBank of the South, a Georgia savings bank (&#8220;HeritageBank&#8221;). On the same date, HeritageBank merged with and into Renasant Bank. On July 1, 2015, Heritage operated 48 banking, mortgage and investment offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The Company issued approximately 8,635,879 shares of its common stock and paid $5.9 million to Heritage stock option holders for 100% of the voting equity interest in Heritage in a transaction valued at $295.4 million. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2.0 billion, which includes loans held for investment and loans held for sale with a fair value of $1.5 billion, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1.7 billion, including deposits with a fair value of $1.4 billion. At the acquisition date, approximately $171.2 million of goodwill and $12.3 million of core deposit intangible assets were recorded. 

In connection with the acquisition of Heritage, the Bank assumed two loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC which covered Citizens Bank of Effingham (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;) and First Southern National Bank (&#8220;First Southern&#8221;). The loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC covered $214 million of Citizens assets and $140 million of First Southern assets. Pursuant to the terms of the loss-share agreements, the FDIC is obligated to reimburse the Bank for 80% of all eligible losses with respect to covered Citizens and First Southern loans, beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred. The Bank has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FDIC for 80% of eligible recoveries with respect to covered Citizens and First Southern loans. The claim periods to submit losses to the FDIC for reimbursement ends February 29, 2016 for nonsingle family Citizens loans and February 28, 2021 for single family Citizens loans.

On the same date, Merchants and Farmers Bank was merged into Renasant Bank. On August 31, 2013, First M&#38;F operated 35 full-service banking offices and eight insurance offices throughout Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. The Company issued approximately 6,175,576 shares of its common stock for 100% of the voting equity interests in First M&#38;F in a transaction valued at $156.8 million.

On August 31, 2011, the Company acquired the Birmingham, Alabama-based trust division of RBC Bank (USA), which services clients in Alabama and Georgia. Under the terms of the transaction, RBC Bank (USA) (which has since been acquired by PNC Bank) transferred its approximately $680 million in assets under management, comprised of personal and institutional clients with over 200 trust, custodial and escrow accounts, to a wholly-owned subsidiary, and Renasant Bank acquired all of the ownership interests in the subsidiary. The subsidiary was merged into Renasant Bank and the acquired operations were reconstituted into a separate division of Renasant Bank, titled Renasant Asset Management. 

FDIC-Assisted Acquisition of Certain Assets and Liabilities of American Trust Bank 

On February 4, 2011, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with loss-share agreements with the FDIC to acquire specified assets and assume specified liabilities of American Trust Bank, a Georgia-chartered bank headquartered in Roswell, Georgia (&#8220;American Trust&#8221;).

Operations 

The Company has three reportable segments: a Community Banks segment, an Insurance segment and a Wealth Management segment. Financial information about our segments for each of the last three years, including information with respect to revenues from external customers, profit or loss and total assets for each segment is contained in Note Q, &#8220;Segment Reporting,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Neither we nor the Bank have any foreign operations. 

Operations of Community Banks 

Substantially all of our business activities are conducted through, and substantially all of our assets and revenues are derived from, the operations of our community banks, which offer a complete range of banking and financial services to individuals and to small to medium-size businesses. These services include checking and savings accounts, business and personal loans, interim construction loans, equipment leasing, accounts receivable financing, as well as safe deposit and night depository facilities. Automated teller machines are located throughout our market area. Our Online and Mobile Banking products and our call center also provide 24-hour banking services. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 172 banking, insurance and financial services offices located throughout our markets in north and central Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida and Georgia. 

Lending Activities . Income generated by our lending activities, in the form of both interest income and loan-related fees, comprises a substantial portion of our revenue, accounting for approximately 63.88%, 66.05% and 64.74% of our total gross revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Total gross revenues consist of interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. Our lending philosophy is to minimize credit losses by following strict credit approval standards, diversifying our loan portfolio by both type and geography and conducting ongoing review and management of the loan portfolio. The following is a description of each of the principal types of loans in our loan portfolio, the relative risk of each type of loan and the steps we take to reduce credit risk. A further discussion of our risk reduction policies and procedures can be found in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading &#8220;Risk Management &#8211; Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.&#8221; Our loans are primarily generated within the market areas where our branches are located. 

&#8212; Commercial, Financial and Agricultural Loans . Commercial, financial and agricultural loans (referred to as &#8220;commercial loans&#8221;), which accounted for approximately 11.76% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 , are customarily granted to established local business customers in our market area on a fully collateralized basis to meet their credit needs. The terms and loan structure are dependent on the collateral and strength of the borrower. The loan-to-value ratios range from 50% to 85%, depending on the type of collateral. Terms are typically short term in nature and are commensurate with the secondary source of repayment that serves as our collateral. 

Commercial lending generally involves different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction lending. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the repayment of these types of loans depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower (and any guarantors). Thus, the general business conditions of the local economy and the local business borrower&#8217;s ability to sell its products and services, thereby generating sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions, are the chief considerations when assessing the risk of a commercial loan. The liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment. Another source of repayment are guarantors of the loan, if any. To manage these risks, the Bank&#8217;s policy is to secure its commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and any other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available. In addition, we actively monitor certain financial measures of the borrower, including advance rate, 

cash flow, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors. We use commercial loan credit scoring models for smaller level commercial loans. 

&#8212; Real Estate &#8211; 1-4 Family Mortgage . We are active in the real estate &#8211; 1-4 family mortgage area (referred to as &#8220;residential real estate loans&#8221;), with approximately 32.06% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 , being residential real estate loans. We offer both first and second mortgages on residential real estate. Loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as &#8220;primary&#8221; 1-4 family mortgages. Loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is rented to tenants or is not the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as &#8220;rental/investment&#8221; 1-4 family mortgages. We also offer loans for the preparation of residential real property prior to construction (referred to in this Annual Report as &#8220;residential land development loans&#8221;). In addition, we offer home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers for purchases, refinances, home improvements, education and other personal expenditures. Both fixed and variable rate loans are offered with competitive terms and fees. Originations of residential real estate loans are generated through either retail efforts in our branches or through loans either originated by or referred by our mortgage operations. We attempt to minimize the risk associated with residential real estate loans by strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower; typically, we also limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio. 

We retain loans for our portfolio when the Bank has sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of established customers and when rates are favorable to retain the loans. We also originate residential real estate loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market to third party private investors or directly to government sponsored agencies. These loans are collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate. When these loans are sold, we either release or retain the related servicing rights, depending on a number of factors including the pricing of such loans in the secondary market, fluctuations in interest rates that would impact the profitability of the loans, as well as other market-related conditions. Residential real estate originations to be sold are sold either on a &#8220;best efforts&#8221; basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a &#8220;best efforts&#8221; sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. The Company does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans. 

We also offer home equity loans or lines of credit as an option to borrowers who elect to utilize the accumulated equity in their homes by borrowing money through either a first or second lien home equity loan or line of credit. We limit our exposure to second lien home equity loans or lines of credit, which inherently carry a higher risk of loss upon default, by limiting these types of loans to borrowers with high credit scores. 

&#8212; Real Estate &#8211; Commercial Mortgage . Our real estate &#8211; commercial mortgage loans (&#8220;commercial real estate loans&#8221;) represented approximately 46.80% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 . We offer loans in which the owner develops a property with the intention of locating its business there. These loans are referred to as &#8220;owner-occupied&#8221; commercial real estate loans. Payments on these loans are dependent on the successful development and management of the business as well as the borrower&#8217;s ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay the loan. If our estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank must mitigate that risk by having sufficient sources of secondary repayment as well as guarantor support. In some instances, in addition to our mortgage on the underlying real estate of the business, our commercial real estate loans are secured by other non-real estate collateral, such as equipment or other assets used in the course of business. 

In addition to owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, we offer loans in which the owner develops a property where the source of repayment of the loan will come from the sale or lease of the developed property, for example, retail shopping centers, hotels, storage facilities, nursing homes, etc. These loans are referred to as &#8220;non-owner occupied&#8221; commercial real estate loans. We also offer commercial real estate loans to developers of commercial properties for purposes of site acquisition and preparation and other development prior to actual construction (referred to in this Annual Report as &#8220;commercial land development loans&#8221;). Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and commercial land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the project and may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as a whole. 

We seek to minimize risks relating to all commercial real estate loans by limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral, the management of the property securing the loan and, where applicable, the financial strength of the tenant occupying the property. Loans are usually structured either to fully amortize over the term of the loan or to balloon after the third year or fifth year of the loan, typically with an amortization period not to exceed 20 years. We also actively monitor such financial measures as advance rate, cash flow, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors. We generally obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties to the transaction based on a review of the guarantor&#8217;s financial statements. 

&#8212; Real Estate &#8211; Construction . Our real estate &#8211; construction loans (&#8220;construction loans&#8221;) represented approximately 6.61% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 . Our construction loan portfolio consists of loans for the construction of single family residential properties, multi-family properties and commercial projects. Maturities for construction loans generally range from 6 to 12 months for residential property and from 12 to 24 months for non-residential and multi-family properties. Construction lending entails significant additional risks compared to residential real estate or commercial real estate lending. A significant additional risk is that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the property under construction, which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. The risk is to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and to ensure proper loan-to-value ratios during the construction phase. However, for many of our construction loans, the Bank engages an independent third party to actively manage the construction process to ensure advances are in line with projects or budgets. To minimize the risks associated with construction lending, we limit loan-to-value ratios to 85% of when-completed appraised values for owner-occupied and investor-owned residential or commercial properties. 

&#8212; Installment Loans to Individuals . Installment loans to individuals (or &#8220;consumer loans&#8221;), which represented approximately 2.13% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 , are granted to individuals for the purchase of personal goods. These loans are generally granted for periods ranging between one and six years at fixed rates of interest from 100 to 500 basis points above the prime interest rate quoted in The Wall Street Journal . Loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences represents the primary risk of default to us. In the event of default, a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose a loss to us in this loan category. Before granting a consumer loan, we assess the applicant&#8217;s credit history and ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations. Although the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. We obtain a lien against the collateral securing the loan and hold title until the loan is repaid in full. 

&#8212; Equipment Financing and Leasing. Equipment financing loans (or &#8220;lease financing loans&#8221;), which represented approximately 0.64% of our total loans at December 31, 2015 , are granted to provide capital to businesses for commercial equipment needs. These loans are generally granted for periods ranging between two and five years at fixed rates of interest. Loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences represents the primary risk of default to us. In the event of default, a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose a loss to us in this loan category. We obtain a lien against the collateral securing the loan and hold title (if applicable) until the loan is repaid in full. Transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, material handling, printing and construction are the industries that typically obtain lease financing. In addition, the not-for-profit product offered as a subset of the product line includes real estate financing for qualified customers at tax-exempt rates. 

To protect against the risks associated with fluctuations in economic conditions, both in our markets and in the United States economy as a whole, management has implemented a strategy to diversify the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio by specifically reducing the concentration of construction and land development loans (both residential and commercial). To accomplish this, over the past few years management applied more stringent levels of underwriting on new originations of such loans and required principal reductions of these loans at time of renewal. The construction loan portfolio was further reduced as such loans were refinanced into permanent financing arrangements due to the completion of the construction phase of underlying projects and thus reclassified to commercial or residential real estate loans. The Company will continue this strategy to maintain the concentration of construction and land development loans in the portfolio at an acceptable level. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , construction and land development loans represented 11.19%, and 10.20%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio. 

Deposit Services . We offer a broad range of deposit services and products to our consumer and commercial clients. Through our community branch networks, we offer consumer checking accounts with free online and mobile banking, which includes bill pay and transfer features, interest bearing checking, money market accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts. 

For our commercial clients, we offer a competitive suite of cash management products which include, but are not limited to, remote deposit capture, account reconciliation with CD-ROM statements, electronic statements, positive pay, ACH origination and wire transfer, wholesale and retail lockbox, investment sweep accounts, enhanced business Internet banking, outbound data exchange and multi-bank reporting. 

The deposit services we offer accounted for approximately 12.16%, 13.00% and 12.69% of our total gross revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, in the form of fees for deposit services. The deposits held by our Bank have been primarily generated within the market areas where our branches are located. 

Operations of Wealth Management 

Through the Wealth Management segment, we offer a wide variety of fiduciary services and administer (as trustee or in other fiduciary or representative capacities) qualified retirement plans, profit sharing and other employee benefit plans, personal trusts and estates. In addition, the Wealth Management segment offers annuities, mutual funds and other investment services through a third party broker-dealer. For 2015 , the Wealth Management segment contributed total revenue of $12.2 million, or 3.23%, of the 

Company&#8217;s total gross revenues. Wealth Management operations are headquartered in Tupelo, Mississippi, and Birmingham, Alabama, but our products and services are available to customers in all of our markets through our community banks. 

Operations of Insurance 

Renasant Insurance is a full-service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers. For 2015 , Renasant Insurance contributed total revenue of $9.6 million, or 2.54%, of the Company&#8217;s total gross revenues and operated ten offices - one office each in Ackerman, Brandon, Corinth, Durant, Kosciusko, Louisville, Madison, Oxford, Starkville and Tupelo, Mississippi. 

Competition 

Community Banks 

Vigorous competition exists in all major product and geographic areas in which we conduct banking business. We compete through our Bank for available loans and deposits with state, regional and national banks in all of our service areas, as well as savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and investment companies. All of these numerous institutions compete in the delivery of services and products through availability, quality and pricing, and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do, including higher total assets and capitalization, greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services. 

Certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate. The following table shows our deposit share in those markets as of June 30, 2015 &#32;(which is the latest date that such information is available):

Wealth Management 

Our Wealth Management segment competes with other banks, brokerage firms, financial advisers and trust companies, which provide one or more of the services and products that we offer. Our wealth management operations compete on the basis of available product lines, rates and fees, as well as reputation and professional expertise. No particular company or group of companies dominates this industry. 

Insurance 

We encounter strong competition in the markets in which we conduct insurance operations. Through our insurance subsidiary, we compete with independent insurance agencies and agencies affiliated with other banks and/or other insurance carriers. All of these agencies compete in the delivery of personal and commercial product lines. There is no dominant insurance agency in our markets. 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. We are a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). As a result, we are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Mississippi; it is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a Mississippi bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance, as the chartering entity of the bank, and by the FDIC, as the insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits. As a result of this extensive system of supervision and regulation, the growth and earnings performance of the Company and the Bank is affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes, rules, regulations and policies administered by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance, as well as by other federal and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations. 

The bank regulatory scheme has two primary goals: to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. This comprehensive system of supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance fund, banks depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders or creditors. To this end, federal and state banking laws and regulations control, among other things, the types of activities in which we and the Bank may engage, permissible investments, the level of reserves that the Bank must maintain against deposits, minimum equity capital levels, the nature and amount of collateral required for loans, maximum interest rates that can be charged, the manner and amount of the dividends that may be paid, and corporate activities regarding mergers, acquisitions and the establishment of branch offices. 

The description below summarizes certain elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us and the Bank. This summary is not, however, intended to describe all laws, regulations and policies applicable to us and the Bank, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretative letters and other written guidance that are described below. 

Dodd-Frank Act 

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act has imposed new restrictions and an expanded regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions like the Bank. Although the Dodd-Frank Act is primarily aimed at the activities of investment banks and large commercial banks, many of the provisions of the legislation will impact operations of community banks such as the Bank. In addition to the Volcker Rule, which is discussed in more detail below, the following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to our operations: 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

Tier 1 capital treatment for &#8220;hybrid&#8221; capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated, subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. 

&#8212; 

The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Previously, the deposit insurance assessment was calculated based on the insured deposits held by the institution. 

&#8212; 

The minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased 20 basis points to 1.35% of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base. The FDIC also was directed to &#8220;offset the effect&#8221; of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. 

&#8212; 

Bank holding companies and banks must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state, which codified long-standing Federal Reserve policy. Any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company must be and remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; 

&#8212; 

Capital requirements for insured depository institutions are now countercyclical, such that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. 

&#8212; 

The Federal Reserve established interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions under a restrictive &#8220;reasonable and proportional cost&#8221; per transaction standard. 

&#8212; 

The regulation of consumer protections regarding mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and prepayment consideration, has been expanded. 

&#8212; 

The &#8220;opt in&#8221; provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1997 have been eliminated, which allows state banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank&#8217;s home state if the law of such other state would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location. 

The foregoing provisions may have the consequence of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues and changing the activities in which we choose to engage. The environment in which banking organizations will now operate, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen. Provisions in the legislation that revoke the Tier 1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities do not apply to the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities because of the Company&#8217;s size. The ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. 

The Volcker Rule &#32;&#32; 

On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators as well as the SEC each adopted a final rule implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; Generally speaking, the final rule prohibits a bank and its affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring certain &#8220;covered funds&#8221; or from acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in such covered funds. Most private equity, venture capital and hedge funds are considered &#8220;covered funds&#8221; as are bank trust preferred collateralized debt obligations. The final rule required banking entities to divest disallowed securities by July 21, 2015, subject to extension upon application. The Volcker Rule did not impact any of our activities nor do we hold any securities that we were required to sell under the rule, but it does limit the scope of permissible activities in which we might engage in the future. 

Supervision and Regulation of Renasant Corporation 

General . As a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act, we are subject to the regulation and supervision applicable to bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s jurisdiction also extends to any company that we directly or indirectly control, such as any non-bank subsidiaries and other companies in which we own a controlling investment. 

Scope of Permissible Activities . Under the BHC Act, we are prohibited from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or financial holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiary banks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may engage, directly or indirectly (including through the ownership of shares of another company), in certain activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; providing certain data processing, storage and transmission services; acting as an investment or financial advisor; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal or real property on a nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage. 

The BHC Act was substantially amended through the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, commonly referred to as the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;). The GLB Act eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial services providers. A bank holding company whose subsidiary deposit institutions are &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; may elect to become a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; (&#8220;FHC&#8221;) and thereby engage without prior Federal Reserve approval in certain banking and non-banking activities that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activity. These &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; organizing, sponsoring and managing mutual funds; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. We have not elected to become an FHC. 

A dominant theme of the GLB Act is functional regulation of financial services, with the primary regulator of the Company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the Company or its subsidiaries wish to engage. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) will regulate bank holding company securities transactions, and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities. 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines . The Federal Reserve has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies to factor off-balance sheet exposure into the assessment of capital adequacy, to minimize disincentives for holding liquid, low-risk assets and to achieve greater consistency in the evaluation of the capital adequacy of major banking organizations worldwide. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. These requirements apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $500 million, such as the Company. 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve has adopted a minimum Tier 1 capital (leverage) ratio, under which a bank holding company must maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank holding company that has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. This minimum leverage requirement only applies to bank holding companies on a consolidated basis if the risk based capital requirements discussed above apply. 

These capital requirements are substantially similar to those imposed on the Bank under FDIC regulations and described in more detail below under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation of Renasant Bank, Capital Adequacy Guidelines.&#8221; Furthermore, these capital requirements will change in connection with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s adoption of the Basel III guidelines described below. 

Payment of Dividends; Source of Strength . The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. This policy provides that in general a bank holding company should pay dividends only when (1) its net income available to shareholders over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

After the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (which codified long-standing Federal Reserve policy), a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks. This means that we are expected to use available resources to provide adequate resources to the Bank, including during periods of financial stress or adversity, and to maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting the Bank where necessary. In addition, any capital loans that we make to the Bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies . The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, merges or consolidates with another bank holding company or acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Federal Reserve will not approve any acquisition, merger, or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned, together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served and the record of a 

bank holding company and its subsidiary bank(s) in combating money laundering activities, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers. 

The BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from itself engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. The principal exception to this prohibition is for a bank holding company engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making determinations whether activities are closely related to banking or managing banks, the Federal Reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency of resources and whether such public benefits outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects, such as decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. 

Control Acquisitions . Federal and state laws, including the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. &#8220;Control&#8221; of a depository institution is a facts and circumstances analysis, but generally an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting securities. Ownership or control of 10% or more of any class of voting securities, where either the depository institution or company is a public company or no other person will own or control a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition, is also presumed to result in the investor controlling the depository institution or other company, although this is subject to rebuttal. 

Anti-Tying Restrictions . Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally established a comprehensive framework to modernize and reform the oversight of public company auditing, improve the quality and transparency of financial reporting by those companies and strengthen the independence of auditors. Among other things, the legislation: 

- 

Created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is empowered to set auditing, quality control and ethics standards, to inspect registered public accounting firms, to conduct investigations and to take disciplinary actions, subject to SEC oversight and review; 

- 

Strengthened auditor independence from corporate management by, among other things, limiting the scope of consulting services that auditors can offer their public company audit clients; 

- 

Heightened the responsibility of public company directors and senior managers for the quality of the financial reporting and disclosure made by their companies. A number of provisions to deter wrongdoing by corporate management were also adopted; 

- 

Imposed a number of new corporate disclosure requirements; and 

- 

Imposed a range of new criminal penalties for fraud and other wrongful acts, as well as extended the period during which certain types of lawsuits can be brought against a company or its insiders. 

The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . Bank holding companies are allowed to acquire savings associations under The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;). Deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of FIRREA, and losses incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally-insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally-insured financial institutions. 

Supervision and Regulation of the Bank 

General . As a Mississippi-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to the regulation and supervision of the FDIC. The regulations of the FDIC and the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance affect virtually all of the Bank&#8217;s activities, including the minimum level of capital, the ability to pay dividends, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing and the ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. 

Insurance of Deposits . The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;), which the FDIC administers. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, deposit insurance on most accounts was increased to $250,000. 

To fund the DIF, FDIC-insured banks are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. For institutions like the Bank with less than $10 billion in assets, the amount of the assessment is based on its risk classification. The higher an institution&#8217;s risk classification, the higher its rate of assessments (on the assumption that such institutions pose a greater risk of loss to the DIF). An institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that the institution poses to the regulators. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. 

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC must pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established as a financing vehicle for the Federal Savings &#38; Loan Insurance Corporation. The assessment rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 is .0058% of insured deposits and is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019 (the corporation&#8217;s ability to issue new debt has been terminated). 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. For an institution with no tangible capital, deposit insurance may be temporarily suspended during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance. If the FDIC terminates an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance, accounts insured at the time of the termination, less withdrawals, will continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. We are not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. 

Interstate Banking and Branching . Under Mississippi law, the Bank may establish additional branch offices within Mississippi, subject to the approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. After the Dodd-Frank Act, we can also establish additional branch offices outside of Mississippi, subject to prior regulatory approval, so long as the laws of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish a branch. Finally, we may also establish offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing branches of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions. 

Dividends . The restrictions and guidelines with respect to the Company&#8217;s payment of dividends are described above. As a practical matter, for so long as our operations chiefly consist of ownership of the Bank, the Bank will remain our source of dividend payments, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to any restrictions applicable to the Bank. 

The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is restricted by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. Under Mississippi law, a Mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock. A Mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend, subject to the approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. In addition, the FDIC must approve any payment of dividends by the Bank. Accordingly, the approval of these supervisory authorities is required prior to the Bank paying dividends to the Company. Federal Reserve regulations also limit the amount the Bank may loan to the Company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines . The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines similar to, and with the same underlying purposes as, those established by the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding companies. Under those guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 

- Current Guidelines . Bank assets are given risk-weights of varying percentages based on risk-based capital guidelines. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset-equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weight will apply. Those computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing loans fully secured by first liens on one-to-four family residential property, which carry a 50% risk weighting. Most investment securities (including, primarily, general obligation claims of states or other political subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk-weight, and direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which have a 0% risk-weight. In converting off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations, are given a 100% risk weighting. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds, standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with a maturity of more than one year), have a 50% risk weighting. Short-term commercial letters of credit have a 20% risk weighting, and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% risk weighting. 

The minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets required by FDIC regulations (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least 4% of total capital must be &#8220;Tier 1 capital,&#8221; consisting of common stockholders&#8217; equity and qualifying preferred stock or hybrid instruments, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets. The remainder, or &#8220;Tier 2 capital,&#8221; may consist of, among other things, (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk weighted assets, (b) unrealized gains on certain equity securities, (c) non-qualifying preferred stock, (d) hybrid capital instruments and (e) qualifying subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations&#8217; capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and any other deductions as determined by the FDIC. 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the FDIC has adopted a minimum Tier 1 capital (leverage) ratio, under which a bank must maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. For a bank that has the highest 

regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion, the leverage ratio must be at least 3%; all other banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. 

- Prompt Corrective Action . Under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions that it regulates. The federal banking agencies (including the FDIC) have adopted substantially similar regulations to implement this mandate. Under the regulations, a bank is (i) &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has total risk-based capital of 10% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6% or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5% or more and is not subject to any order or final capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure, (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or more and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4% or more (3% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, (iii) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4% (3% under certain circumstances), (iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 3%, and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 

The capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of regulatory examinations, the bank&#8217;s ability to engage in certain activities and the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank. In addition, federal banking regulators must take various mandatory supervisory actions, and may take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. Generally, banking regulators must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. 

Section 38 of the FDIA and the regulations promulgated thereunder also specify circumstances under which the FDIC may reclassify a well-capitalized bank as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized bank or an undercapitalized bank to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized bank as critically undercapitalized). 

- Basel III . The current risk-based capital guidelines that apply to both the Company and the Bank are based on the 1988 capital accord, referred to as Basel I, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by federal bank regulators. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new capital accord, Basel II. Basel II modifies risk weightings in an attempt to make capital requirements more risk-sensitive and provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk - an &#8220;advanced,&#8221; internal ratings-based approach tailored to individual institutions&#8217; circumstances and a &#8220;standardized&#8221; approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted under existing risk-based capital guidelines. Basel II also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures. In 2007, U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the advanced approaches of Basel II for &#8220;core&#8221; bank holding companies and banks having $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more of foreign exposures. These rules did not apply to the Bank or the Company. 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;. In early July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules relevant to us: (1) the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and (2) the &#8220;standardized approach of Basel II for non-core banks and bank holding companies,&#8221; such as the Bank and the Company. The capital framework under Basel III will replace the existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings associations and U.S. bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in total assets, and all savings and loan holding companies. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Rules&#8221;) that call for broad and comprehensive revision of regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Rules implemented a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement and other items affecting the calculation of the numerator of a banking organization&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, the Basel III Rules apply limits to a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not maintain a "capital conservation buffer," which is a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. For a detailed discussion of the new CET1 ratio and the impact on the Company, see Note P, &#8220;Regulatory Matters,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

The Company and the Bank are now required to comply with the Basel III rules, although certain parts of the rules will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2019. The final Basel III rules regarding our regulatory capital ratios, which are now fully phased in, made the following changes: 

- 

We are now required to maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of not less than 4.5%; 

- 

The minimum leverage capital ratio has been increased to 4% for all banking organizations (previously banking organizations that were highly rated and were not contemplating significant growth or expansion were allowed to maintain a 3% minimum leverage capital ratio); 

- 

The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio has been increased from 4% to 6%; and 

- 

The minimum total risked-based capital ratio that we are required to maintain remained at 8%. We and the Bank meet all minimum capital requirements under the Basel III rules as currently in effect. 

The final Basel III rules also changed the capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of prompt corrective action. Under the final rules, to be well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% (this is a new requirement), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% (up form 6%), a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a leverage capital ratio of at least 5%. In addition, the final Basel III rules established more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital and imposed certain deductions from and adjustments to the measure of common equity Tier 1 capital. 

The Basel II standardized approach revised the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity, particularly with respect to equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds), foreign exposures and residential real estate assets. It also established alternatives to credit ratings for calculating risk-weighted assets consistent with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Finally, as noted above, the Basel III rules limit payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer.&#8221; When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the required capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements; as of January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer is 0.625% of risk-weighted assets. 

These provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks . Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, taking the following actions: 

- 

acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary; 

- 

investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s total assets; 

- 

acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors&#8217;, trustees&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance coverage or bankers&#8217; blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and 

- 

acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. 

Under FDIC regulations, insured banks engaging in impermissible activities, or banks that wish to engage in otherwise impermissible activities, may seek approval from the FDIC to continue or commence such activities, as the case may be. The FDIC will not approve such an application if the bank does not meet its minimum capital requirements or the proposed activities present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. 

Safety and Soundness . The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have implemented rules and guidelines concerning standards for safety and soundness required pursuant to Section 39 of the FDIA. In general, the standards relate to operational and managerial matters, asset quality and earnings and compensation. The operational and managerial standards cover (1) internal controls and information systems, (2) internal audit systems, (3) loan documentation, (4) credit underwriting, (5) interest rate exposure, (6) asset growth and (7) compensation, fees and benefits. Under the asset quality and earnings standards, the Bank must 

establish and maintain systems to identify problem assets and prevent deterioration in those assets and to evaluate and monitor earnings and ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain adequate capital reserves. Finally, the compensation standard states that compensation will be considered excessive if it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the services actually performed by the individual being compensated. 

If an insured state-chartered bank fails to meet any of the standards promulgated by regulation, then such institution will be required to submit a plan within 30 days to the FDIC specifying the steps it will take to correct the deficiency. In the event that an insured state-chartered bank fails to submit or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan within the time allowed by the federal banking agency, Section 39 of the FDIA provides that the FDIC must order the institution to correct the deficiency. The FDIC may also (1) restrict asset growth; (2) require the bank to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets; (3) restrict the rates of interest that the bank may pay; or (4) take any other action that would better carry out the purpose of prompt corrective action. We believe that the Bank has been and will continue to be in compliance with each of these standards. 

Federal Reserve System . The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. The required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or an account at a Federal Reserve bank. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was in compliance with its reserve requirements. 

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), the FDIC assesses the Bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The FDIC&#8217;s assessment is taken into account when evaluating any application we submit for, among other things, approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility, an office relocation, a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution. The Bank has undertaken significant actions to comply with the CRA, and it received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating by the FDIC with respect to its CRA compliance. Both the U.S. Congress and banking regulatory agencies have proposed substantial changes to the CRA and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that any such changes would have on us or the Bank. 

Financial Privacy Requirements . Federal law and regulations limit a financial institution&#8217;s ability to share consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, these provisions require all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution&#8217;s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the sharing of personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. The sharing of information for marketing purposes is also subject to limitations. The Bank currently has privacy protection policy and procedures in place, which we believe complies with all applicable regulations. 

Anti-Money Laundering . Federal anti-money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. These provisions include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the United States have anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-laundering provisions. 

Supervision and Regulation of our Wealth Management and Insurance Operations 

Our Wealth Management and Insurance operations are subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of the United States and the State of Mississippi. The laws and regulations are primarily for the benefit of clients. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including the violation of such regulations, conviction of crimes and the like. Other possible sanctions which may be imposed for violation of regulations include suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time, censures and fines. 

Monetary Policy and Economic Controls 

We and the Bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to stabilize prices. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying degrees to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the various money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the Federal Reserve, the effect on our, and the Bank&#8217;s, future business and earnings cannot be predicted with accuracy. 

Sources and Availability of Funds 

The funds essential to our, and our Bank&#8217;s, business consist primarily of funds derived from customer deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The availability of such funds is primarily dependent upon the economic policies of the federal government, the economy in general and the general credit market for loans. 

Personnel 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed 1,996 people throughout all of our segments on a full-time equivalent basis. Of this total, the Bank accounted for 1,930 employees (inclusive of employees in our Community Banks and Wealth Management segments), and Renasant Insurance employed 66 individuals. The Company has no additional employees; however, at December 31, 2015 , 15 employees of the Bank served as officers of the Company in addition to their positions with the Bank. 

Dependence Upon a Single Customer 

No material portion of our loans have been made to, nor have our deposits been obtained from, a single or small group of customers; the loss of any single customer or small group of customers with respect to any of our reportable segments would not have a materially adverse effect on our business as a whole or with respect to that segment in particular. A discussion of concentrations of credit in our loan portfolio is set forth under the heading &#8220;Financial Condition - Loans&#8221; in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
