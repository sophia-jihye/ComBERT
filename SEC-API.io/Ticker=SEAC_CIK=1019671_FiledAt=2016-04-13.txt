 ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL 

SeaChange International, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded on July 9, 1993, is an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen video. Our products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for cable television system operators, telecommunications companies, satellite operators and media companies. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to television service providers including: cable television system operators, such as Liberty Global, plc. (&#147;LGI&#148;), Comcast Corporation (&#147;Comcast&#148;), Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., AT&#38;T, Inc. and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Direct TV and Dish Network Corporation; and media companies such as BBC Worldwide. 

Our products and services are designed to enable our customers to reduce capital and operating expenses, reduce subscriber turnover, and increase average revenue per subscriber by establishing new, software-as-a-service (&#147;SaaS&#148;) revenue-generating subscription video services and advertising. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenues by offering services such as video-on-demand (&#147;VOD&#148;) programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions (&#147;TVs&#148;), mobile telephones (&#147;smart phones&#148;), personal computers (&#147;PCs&#148;), tablets and over-the-top (&#147;OTT&#148;) streaming players. Our systems enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content. 

SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasing, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewer habits are shifting. The primary thrust of our business has been to enable the delivery of video assets in the evolving multiscreen television environment. Through acquisitions and partnerships, we have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more technologically advanced software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serve adjacent markets, such as mobile and OTT. Our core technologies provide a foundation for products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber interactivity. 

We have received several awards for technological excellence, including three Emmy Awards for our pivotal roles in the growth of volume service provider businesses including VOD and multi-channel television advertising. Last fiscal year, we won the Technology Services Industry Association STAR award for Best Practices in the Delivery of Customer Success and Support and our Rave premium OTT video platform was recognized with a 2015 TV Connect Award and a 2015 Cable &#38; Satellite International Award. Our achievements on behalf of certain customers have also received significant market recognition including winning the Liberty Global Vendor Award for Best Product &#38; Service Quality and the Cable Europe Innovation Award for cable operator Voo&#146;s multiscreen service launch. 

Effective April 6, 2016, Edward Terino, who previously served as our Chief Operating Officer, was appointed Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) of SeaChange, following the termination without cause of Jay Samit as CEO and Director, as previously reported in a Current Reports on Form 8-K (&#147;Form 8-K&#148;) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) on April 7, 2016. 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

Our business is comprised of focus across the following product areas: multiscreen video backoffice, advertising and video gateway software solutions. Our revenue sources consist of product revenue from these areas, as well as related services. 

&#160;

Multiscreen Video Backoffice 

SeaChange Adrenalin Multiscreen Video Backoffice Platform. Adrenalin is a comprehensive software platform that enables service providers to manage, monetize and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across TVs, PCs, tablets, smart phones and other IP-enabled devices. Adrenalin is a modular software solution allowing customers to gradually adopt new functionality and features to expand multiscreen television distribution capabilities. We offer our Adrenalin platform under two deployment options; through onsite software licenses and on a cloud-based offering. With an onsite software license model, revenue is derived from perpetual software licenses, maintenance and support fees and professional services. In a cloud-based offering, we license our product offerings and customers pay us on a monthly recurring basis based on the total number of subscribers deployed by the customer. 

SeaChange AssetFlow Content Management Solution. In today&#146;s multiscreen viewing platform, a show, movie or advertisement and its associated metadata, such as poster, description and pricing, are reproduced with numerous variants to serve the unique requirements of multiple network types, consumer devices and geographies. At the point of content ingest, our AssetFlow software is used to receive, manage and publish content for on-demand viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs and other consumer devices. AssetFlow simplifies the increasingly complex tasks of movie and television program asset tracking, metadata management, and overall content workflow. 

SeaChange Rave&#153; Premium OTT Video Platform. Our Rave premium OTT video platform (&#147;Rave&#148;) offering provides a managed services offering for our customers. Rave enables live, time-shifted, pay-per-view, on-demand video services and storefront creation. Advanced content recommendations, discovery and social media are enabled through SeaChange&#146;s user experience and third-party applications. Rave includes services, tools and integrations for OTT content workflow, media management and analytics. Rave also enables video and interactive cross-device advertising throughout individual streams and user experiences. Advanced content promotion and monetization features include download to purchase and rent, subscription packaging and couponing. Through these features, Rave allows media companies and service providers to fully integrate with the connected consumer lifestyle and create a deeper audience relationship to project their brand and create pertinent, contextual promotions and advertising. 

Advertising 

SeaChange Infusion Advanced Advertising Platform. As more video content is served to multiple consumer devices, the ability to generate additional revenue by inserting advertising on these devices becomes crucial to service providers seeking to offset content rights costs and reduce subscriber fees for viewing the content. Infusion enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multiscreen, broadcast, on-demand and OTT viewing and reach their audiences while viewers watch content across multiple devices. 

Video Gateway Software 

Nucleus. Nucleus ports to third-party set-top boxes, or other customer premises equipment hardware and system on a chip, and acts as a hub for all video distribution to any IP- connected device throughout the home, such as tablets, smart phones and game consoles. SeaChange capitalized on open software and networking technologies to create Nucleus, a fully customizable foundation for rich multiscreen services running on the chipset and hardware. Nucleus enables the service providers to select the chipset, hardware and set-top box vendor of their choice. Nucleus extends providers&#146; video services to a wide range of video consumer devices through its support for Digital Living Network Alliance networking protocols, and enables them to enhance their overall offering by providing the framework for the introduction of new applications. Further, Nucleus leverages the industry Reference Design Kit, a technology standard that enables the video service provider community to take advantage of open technologies to more rapidly introduce and support service innovations. 

Services 

SeaChange offers comprehensive professional services and maintenance and support for all its products. We have developed extensive capabilities in systems integration, implementation and customer engineering. We also offer 

&#160;

managed services with advantages, including remote monitoring and proactive system maintenance, to help our customers quickly and confidently establish new on-demand and multiscreen services. 

STRATEGY 

Our goal is to strengthen our position as a leading global provider of multiscreen video delivery solutions by enabling service providers and content owners to increase revenue opportunities by delivering transformative multiscreen video services to their end subscribers. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We intend to continue providing our current and future customer base with industry-leading solutions through our focus on product innovation and substantial investment in research and development for our latest feature-rich software products and services; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We intend to provide pre-packaged integrated solutions with the goal of better enabling new and existing customers to drive the adoption of Rave and SaaS commercial models through service offerings hosted and/or managed by us; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We intend on continuing to pursue acquisitions and collaborations which we believe will strengthen our industry leadership position, expand our geographic presence, open new markets or allow us to expand to new products or services, or enhance our existing ones; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We may enter into strategic relationships to help our customers address deficiencies in their market space; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Although our initial sale with a service provider may be for a single screen and device, once a service provider deploys services using our Adrenalin platform, we believe we are well positioned to sell additional features to that service provider to help them expand the number of devices in their customers&#146; households; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our customers are located worldwide and include top service providers. We believe we are well positioned to grow by adding customers in regions where we already have a strong presence and by expanding our geographic footprint in Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition, we intend to penetrate more deeply into other markets such as mobile, satellite, telecommunications and media companies. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Our research and development costs were $33.7 million in fiscal 2016, $42.2 million in fiscal 2015 and $39.7 million in fiscal 2014. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce timely new integrated solutions and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements in our current and future customer base as well as new markets. We have made substantial investments in developing and bringing to market our next generation products. Our current research and development activities are focused on developing multiscreen television platforms, video gateway software and advertising solutions in the multiscreen video backoffice market, and integrating the solutions we currently offer. Our direct sales and marketing groups closely monitor changes in customer needs, changes in the marketplace and emerging industry standards to help us focus our research and development efforts to address our customers&#146; needs, such as increasing average revenue per subscriber, lowering operating and capital costs and reducing customer churn. Our significant research and development efforts are performed in the United States at our Acton, Massachusetts headquarters as well as our sites in California and Pennsylvania; and worldwide in Bangalore, India; Manila, Philippines and Eindhoven, Netherlands. 

During fiscal 2016, we continued the focus of our research and development efforts on the next generation software platforms, which are vital to our customers&#146; success. We achieved this by further increasing our investment in our software products for multiscreen video and video gateway software platforms, while reducing our investment in certain legacy product lines. As of January 31, 2016, we had a research and development staff of 294 employees. 

&#160;

SELLING AND MARKETING 

Our sales cycle tends to be long, in some instances twelve to twenty-four months, and purchase orders are typically in excess of one million dollars. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to predict what quarter or fiscal year our sales will occur. In light of the complexity of our video products, we primarily utilize a direct sales process. We sell and market our products worldwide through a direct sales organization, primarily conducted from our headquarters although we will use sales representatives deployed in different regions where we do not have a direct sales force. Working closely with customers to understand and define their needs enables us to obtain better information regarding market requirements, enhance our expertise in our customers&#146; industries, and more effectively and precisely convey to customers how our solutions address their specific needs. 

We use several marketing programs to focus on our targeted markets to support the sale and distribution of our products. We also market certain of our products to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit our products at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote the awareness of our products. We also publish articles in trade and technical journals. As of January 31, 2016, we had selling and marketing staff of 51 employees. 

MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CONTROL 

Our manufacturing operation consists primarily of component and subassembly procurement, systems integration and final assembly, testing and quality control of the complete systems. As of January 31, 2016 we had a manufacturing staff of 10 employees. 

OUR CUSTOMERS 

We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers. Our customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large service provider customers. A significant portion of our revenues in any given fiscal period have been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, Comcast and LGI each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 

We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter. 

We do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful as an indicator of our future level of revenue for any particular period. Because of the requirements of particular customers, orders may require final acceptance prior to revenue being recognized, resulting in the related revenues not being recognized in the ensuing quarter. Therefore, there is no direct correlation between the backlog at the end of any quarter and our total revenue for the following quarter or other periods. 

COMPETITION 

The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with a large number of suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete principally based on price. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete 

&#160;

principally on the basis of the breadth of our products&#146; features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors. 

In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Arris Group Inc., and Ericsson Inc. as well as in-house solutions built by the service provider. In our video gateway software market, we compete with system integrators and gateway software and applications vendors who offer proprietary software and hardware solutions. In the advertisement platform market, we generally compete with Arris Group Inc. In the OTT market, we compete with video platform providers such as thePlatform, MLB Advanced Media and Ooyala. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources. 

Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter into strategic relationships to offer complete solutions, and in the future our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products. 

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 

Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon our proprietary rights. We have been granted 31 patents worldwide and have several patents pending for various technologies developed and used in our products. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that in the future not all of these patent applications will be issued or that, if issued, the validity of these patents would not be upheld. It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or as a result of an allegation that we infringe others&#146; intellectual property. 

EMPLOYEES 

The table below represents the number of full-time employees that we employ in different geographic areas across the world for the periods shown. We also use part-time and many other temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

ACQUISITION AND LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT 

On February 2, 2015, we acquired TLL, LLC (&#147;Timeline Labs&#148;), a California-based SaaS company. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a restructuring plan (including a possible winding down of the Timeline Labs operations), as previously reported in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 17, 2016. Based on the decision to enter into the restructuring plan and the plan&#146;s impact on the projected future cash flows of the Timeline Labs operations, we determined that the carrying amount of all long-term assets that resulted from the February 2015 acquisition had exceeded the fair value as of January 31, 2016. As a result, these long-term assets were deemed fully impaired and we recorded the $21.9 million net book value of these long-term assets as a component of loss on impairment of TLL, LLC net assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016. Additionally, we reduced the contingent consideration liability associated with the Timeline Labs acquisition to zero, as we determined that the defined performance criteria would not be achieved, and credited the reversal of the liability of $0.4 million to loss on impairment of TLL, LLC net assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period ending January 31, 2016. In February 2016, we implemented cost-saving actions related to the restructuring plan and we will continue to service the clients of Timeline Labs through the first half of fiscal 2017. See Note 4, &#147;Timeline Labs Acquisition and Loss on Impairment,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
