Business 

Overview 

We are an early commercial-stage molecular oncology diagnostics company that develops and commercializes proprietary circulating tumor cell, or CTC, and circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, assays utilizing a standard blood sample, or &#8220;liquid biopsy.&#8221; Our current breast, lung and gastric cancer assays provide, and our planned future assays would provide, information to oncologists and other physicians that enable them to select appropriate personalized treatment for their patients based on better, timelier and more-detailed data on the characteristics of their patients&#8217; tumors.

Our current assays and our planned future assays focus on all the key solid tumor indications utilizing our Target-Selector TM offering for the biomarker analysis of CTCs and ctDNA from a standard blood sample. The Target-Selector offering is based on an internally developed and patented, microfluidics-based CTC capture and analysis platform, with enabling features that change how CTC testing can be used by clinicians by providing real-time biomarker detection and monitoring requiring only a standard blood sample. Our patent pending ctDNA technology enables mutation detection with enhanced sensitivity and specificity and is applicable to nucleic acid from CTCs or other sample types, such as blood plasma. We believe the Target-Selector technology can be used as a stand-alone test for molecular biomarker screening and monitoring.

At our corporate headquarters facility located in San Diego, California, we operate a clinical laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologists. We manufacture our microfluidic channels, related equipment and certain reagents to perform our current assays and our planned future assays at this facility. CLIA certification is required before any clinical laboratory, including ours, may perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of obtaining information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or the assessment of health. The assays we offer and intend to offer are classified as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, under CLIA regulations.

We are continuing to commercialize our Target-Selector assays for a number of solid tumor indications such as: breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. These assays utilize our dual CTC and ctDNA technology platform and provide biomarker analysis from a standard blood sample. 

In the case of our breast and gastric cancer offering, biomarker analysis involves fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, for the detection and quantitation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, gene copy number as well as immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen receptor, or ER, protein, which is currently commercially available. We plan to include immunocytochemical analysis of progesterone receptor, or PR, proteins as part of the Target-Selector menu in 2016. A patient&#8217;s HER2 status provides the physician with information about the appropriateness of therapies such as Herceptin&#174; or Tykerb&#174;. ER and PR status provides the physician with information about the appropriateness of endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors.

The lung cancer biomarker analysis currently includes FISH testing for ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements and mutation analysis of the T790M, Deletion 19, and L858R mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, gene as well as B-RAF and K-RAS using our Target-Selector platform. The L858R mutation of the EGFR gene and Exon 19 deletions as activators of EGFR kinase activity are associated with the drugs Tarceva&#174;, Gilotrif&#174; and Iressa&#174;. The codon 12 and 13 mutations of the K-RAS gene are found in patients whose tumors are unlikely to respond to the EGFR kinase inhibitors such as Erbitux&#174; and Vectibix&#174;. 

For lung cancer, we also offer a resistance panel assay consisting of the biomarkers MET, HER2 (both of which we perform using our technology for CTCs) and T790M which is performed using ctDNA in plasma. These biomarkers are used by physicians to identify the mechanism causing disease progression for patients with NSCLC who are being treated with TKI therapy and therefore could qualify for inclusion in a clinical trial.

Fibroblast growth receptor 1, or FGFR1, amplification is offered using our CTC technology. FGFR1 is present in several tumor types, including both NSCLC and SCLC and has been shown to be a prognostic indicator of progression. FGFR1 is also a key target for many drugs which are in clinical development.

Mutations of the B-RAF gene are associated with Zelboraf&#174; and Tafinlar&#174;, which are both approved for treating patients with melanoma and are in clinical trials for lung cancer. We offer testing for B-RAF on blood using our ctDNA offering.

We plan to add other biomarker analyses on blood samples to our current assays and our planned future Target-Selector assays as their relevance is demonstrated in clinical trials and/or included in guidelines used by physicians to make treatment decisions.

Biomarkers are molecular or cellular features of a cancer cell that indicate an abnormality. This abnormality, typically a genetic mutation or aberration, detected at eith er the gene, protein or metabolite level, may in fact be responsible for the transformation of the cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell. We have focused our efforts on biomarkers associated with specific targeted cancer therapeutics, and on biomarkers that create resistance to those therapeutics. Examples include an amplified HER2 gene, which is associated with HER2-targeted therapeutics like Herceptin &#174; , Perjeta &#174; , Kadcyla &#174; and Tykerb &#174; for the treatment of breast cancer, or a mutated B-RAF gene, which is associated with the drugs Zelboraf &#174; (Daiichi-Sankyo/Genentech/Roche) and Tafinlar &#174; (GlaxoSmithKline) for the treatment of melanoma. This is important because the presence or level of these biomarkers indicates to a physician that the associated therapy is appropriate for the patient, or instead that the patient has, or has developed, resistance to that therapy. 

Biomarkers have traditionally been detected in tumor tissue after biopsy or re-section, with the analysis performed by a pathologist. We are able to perform these same analyses on CTCs or ctDNA on a standard blood sample using our Target-Selector offering through our CLIA laboratory, meaning that the biomarkers detected in a patient&#8217;s tumor can now be monitored on a real-time basis without the need for a tissue biopsy. Because of the difficulty or inability to obtain periodic tissue biopsies, especially at the time of recurrence, this offers the physician a new source and level of information than was previously available.

We also have a research and development program focused on technology enhancements and novel platform development and are evaluating clinical applications for cancer diagnostic assays in different cancer types and clinical settings. We offer our current and planned unique cancer diagnostic assays through our CLIA laboratory to physicians for patient care applications as well as to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic centers using CTC or ctDNA testing, with biomarker analysis including genetic analysis, in their clinical trials and research efforts. CTC assays, particularly those that offer analysis of CTCs for treatment-associated biomarkers, are becoming powerful tools in the practice of personalized medicine. They enable physicians to utilize a standard blood sample as a &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; to assess the status of their patient&#8217;s cancer at a cellular and molecular level on an ongoing basis, and to select therapies that have the highest likelihood of benefiting their patients.

For commercial accessions received from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the expected price to be collected at 2015 Medicare schedule rates ranged from approximately $179 to $2,265 per accession, and the weighted-average expected price to be collected is approximately $759 per accession, although such reimbursement experience has not yet been achieved. Relatively higher reimbursement rates are expected to be achieved for cases billed to private payors. Approximately 48% of commercial accessions billed from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 were subject to Medicare reimbursement, and approximately 47% and 42% of commercial revenues and total revenues, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were associated with Medicare. We were not reimbursed at these average rates in 2015 for a variety of reasons, including billing challenges related to changes in Medicare CPT codes for our FISH assays in early 2015 and because we were setting up our internal processes and managing an external &#8220;out-sourced&#8221; billing company. Additionally, a significant amount of our non-Medicare business (private payors) for a good portion of 2015 was not contracted and reimbursement for this business was not at &#8220;in network&#8221; rates and was therefore inconsistent. We did begin to contract private payor networks in 2015 and our number of accessions treated as &#8220;in network&#8221; increased and reimbursement is improving. We are currently contracted with six Preferred Provider Organization networks and one large health plan and we expect to continue to gain contracts in order to be considered as an &#8220;in-network&#8221; provider with additional plans.

Our future average reimbursement per commercial accession is uncertain and will be impacted by several factors, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

The mix of our accessions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Changes in Medicare schedule rates which generally occur annually; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to successfully contract private payor business in order to be considered &#8220;in-network;&#8221; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The mix of business across payors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to receive reimbursement from private payors, and the level of reimbursement we are able to negotiate relative to Medicare schedule rates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to successfully implement our patient billing module and to collect copayments or other amounts from patients; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to successfully implement internal billing policies and manage our out-sourced billing company; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to improve the recognition of the medical value of our assays, through publication of clinical utility study results and/or possible further improvement of the assays; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to get reimbursed for capturing CTC&#8217;s; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Introduction of additional assays; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased demand generated by our future sales and marketing efforts, and similar commercial factors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our ability to successfully implement intern al billing and collection processes; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Coverage policies as determined by each health plan. 

Factors that could cause pricing for commercial customers to decrease include any perceived lack of clinical utility for CTC or ctDNA testing, or increased competition from other reference labs or in vitro diagnostics, or IVD, manufacturers. Third-party governmental and private payors have reimbursement policies and fee schedules which determine the amounts, if any, we would receive for performing assays for their covered patients. Such governmental and private third-party payors frequently make determinations about how much (if anything) they are willing to pay for assays such as ours, or for components of such assays; these determinations are important to our business and can have adverse or positive effects on the price we receive for our testing. For example, private payors often look to Medicare policies and rates when setting their reimbursement rates.

We have a sales and marketing team to market and sell our commercialized assays and our planned future cancer diagnostic assays directly to oncologists and other physicians. At December 31, 2015, we had a group of 11 sales representatives, and, based on our success and assay volume, we plan to grow this number to 15-20 within two years.

We collaborate with physicians and researchers at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the University of California, San Diego, University of California, Irvine, Washington University, University of Colorado, Yale University and Columbia University and plan to expand our collaborative relationships to include other key thought leaders at other institutions for the cancer types we target with our Target Selector commercialized assays and our planned future assays. Such relationships help us develop and validate the effectiveness and utility of our commercialized assays and our planned future assays in specific clinical settings and provide us access to patient samples and data. 

We completed a study, published in Cancer Medicine in February 2013, utilizing our assay, and a version of this assay adapted for use with bone marrow samples, with a group at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center comprised of breast cancer surgeons, pathologists and basic researchers. In this study, we demonstrated the ability to identify HER2 positive CTCs and disseminated tumor cells, or DTCs, seen in bone marrow in patients that had been previously classified as HER2 negative by analysis of their tumor tissue. A HER2 positive result in a patient with breast cancer provides an indication to the physician that there is likely to be a survival benefit from treatment with Herceptin &#174; , which has been demonstrated in a number of large clinical studies.

We were involved in a clinical study led by investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute following up on the Cancer Medicine findings in CTCs. This study has completed enrolling patients. In the screening phase of this study, we tested in our CLIA-certified, CAP accredited, and state-licensed laboratory blood samples from HER2 negative patients based on standard tumor tissue analysis, to identify those patients that have HER2 positive CTCs. These patients were then assigned to chemotherapy plus Herceptin &#174; , and followed for a period of time, with additional CTC assays, including biomarker analysis for HER2 using FISH, performed at subsequent time points. In December 2014 we announced findings that were presented at the San Antonio Breast Conference that 22% of 311 patients tested, who were previously HER2 negative according to a solid tumor biopsy, were found, upon disease progression, to be HER2 positive by CTC analysis, making them potential candidates for anti-HER2 therapy as the cancer evolves. Moreover, our multi-antibody CTC capture method identified a substantial subset of patients who would not likely be detected with commonly used CTC capture technologies. This added 10% (included in the 22%) to the number of women who were candidates for this highly specific targeted therapy.

With our cooperation, researchers at Columbia published a study in the journal, Clinical and Translational Oncology in February 2015. The study demonstrated the high correlation (79%) of circulating tumor cells, primary tumor tissue biopsy and metastatic tumor tissue biopsy for determination of hormone receptor status (ER/PR) in breast cancer patients. The investigators also found that this high correlation was strongest when comparing metastatic tissue biopsy to CTCs (83%). The conclusion of the study was that determining ER/PR status in CTCs using our platform is feasible, with high concordance in ER/PR between tumor tissue (as determined with immunohistochemistry, or IHC) and CTCs (as determined with immunocytochemistry, or ICC). The authors suggest a larger trial to determine the prognostic significance of these findings.

In collaboration with the University of California, San Diego, in June 2015 we presented the clinical validation data of our ctDNA assay demonstrating a very high level of concordance to tissue results (88%), and with our &#62;95% analytical sensitivity and 99% analytical specificity we offer a validated, robust non-invasive solution for mutation identification and monitoring in patients with lung cancer. The recent United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval of Tagrisso &#174;, a third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, presents an opportunity for patients to be monitored using a ctDNA assay.

We plan to grow our business by directly offering oncologists and other physicians our liquid biopsy CTC and ctDNA assays. Based on our product development data, as well as discussions with our collaborators, we believe that our planned assays should provide important information and clinical value to physicians. In particular, CTC and ctDNA tests should deliver important, actionable information not provided by other tests. For example, the market leading clinical CTC test is the FDA approved 

CellSearch &#174; test (Janssen Diagnostics), which provides CTC enumeration, but is not FDA approved to perform biomarker analysis. We believe our ability to rapidly translate research insights about the utility of cytogenetic, immunocytochemical and molecular biomarkers to provide information to oncologists and other physicians for treatment decisions in the clinical setting will improve patient treatment and management, and that these assays will become a key component in the standard of care for personalized cancer trea tment. 

According to the National Cancer Institute, there were approximately 230,000 new cases of breast cancer and approximately 220,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2015, with over 3.4 million patients who have had a diagnosis of these cancers and are either living with these diseases and are undergoing treatment or are being monitored. For example, in breast cancer, many women have been deemed cancer-free, but continue to undergo periodic monitoring to assure there has been no disease recurrence. Our commercialized assays and our other planned assays only require a readily accessible standard blood sample and thus may be used to help manage these patients, including supporting the selection of appropriate treatment, at multiple time points during the course of their disease. Because our assays require only a standard blood sample, they can be particularly useful when there is no currently available biopsy or surgical material, as is often the case in lung cancer, even at the time of initial evaluation. For example, up to 25% of patients with lung cancer are not surgically treated for various reasons, including patient status (consensus statement from the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons; Chest , Dec. 2012). This is also the case with breast and lung cancers once surgical resection of the tumor has taken place and treatment has been initiated. Patients with breast and lung cancer must often undergo surgical resection of their primary tumor as part of their treatment. Therefore, at the time of progression or recurrence there may be no ability to obtain a tissue biopsy. Additionally, many studies have shown that most tumors mutate during treatment and as the disease progresses, so information from the initial tumor tissue may not be relevant. Again, a significant benefit of our technology is that it allows physicians to assess the current status of the tumors on a real-time basis utilizing a standard blood sample or liquid biopsy.

We currently offer and conduct our commercialized diagnostic assays and offer our clinical trial services at our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited and state- licensed laboratory. Our current assays and our planned near-term cancer diagnostic assays and clinical trial services include:

&#183; 

CTC and ctDNA Testing . Our current assays and our other planned cancer diagnostic assays are based on our Target-Selector technologies and are currently intended to be performed only in our clinical laboratory. After completing testing, we or our partners provide our customers with an easy to understand report that describes the results of the analyses performed, designed to help oncologists and other physicians make better decisions about the treatment of their patients. 

&#183; 

Clinical Trial Services. We plan to utilize our clinical laboratory and translational research capabilities to provide clinical trial and research services to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations to improve the efficiency and economic viability of their clinical trials. Our clinical trials and translational research services could leverage our knowledge of CTCs and ctDNA and our ability to develop and implement new cytogenetic, immunocytochemical and molecular diagnostic assays. Our current assays can, and our other planned cancer diagnostic assays and biomarker assays are anticipated to be able to, help optimize clinical trial patient selection, and as a result potentially improve the likelihood of success of the clinical trial. With positive results in a clinical trial, our assays would more easily then move into standard clinical practice, helping physicians select the most appropriate therapy for their patients. 

We intend to continue to commercialize cancer diagnostic assays in the United States as LDTs performed in our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited, and state-licensed laboratory. We plan to evaluate potential opportunities for the commercialization of our products in other countries. We are currently exploring the possibility of introducing ctDNA technology outside the United States as part of CE-marked IVD test kits and/or testing systems utilizing our Target-Selector technologies. Additionally, we plan to evaluate opportunities for licensing of our products and proprietary technologies to partners in the United States and abroad.

Our sales strategy is to engage oncologists and other physicians in the United States at private and group practices, hospitals and cancer centers. In addition, we market our clinical trial and research services to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations.

Market Overview 

Cancer Market Overview

Despite many advances in the treatment of cancer, it remains one of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. According to the World Cancer Report 2014, cancers figure among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer related deaths in 2012. It is also expected that the number of new cases will rise by approximately 70% over the next two decades. The incidence of, and deaths caused by, the major cancers are staggering. The following data published by the National Cancer Institute shows estimated new cases and deaths for 2014, and prevalence in 2010, in the United States for the major solid cancers types:

In addition to the human toll, the financial cost of cancer is overwhelming. An independent study published in 2010 and conducted jointly by the American Cancer Society and LIVESTRONG ranked cancer as the most economically devastating cause of death in the world - estimated to be as high as $895 billion globally. According to an article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the direct cost of cancer deaths in the United States in 2000 was over $115 billion, and if lost wages and caregiver costs were added, the total costs increased to over $230 billion.

Cancer is a Heterogeneous Disease

Cancer constitutes a heterogeneous class of diseases, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth that results from a combination of both environmental and hereditary risk factors. Many different tissue types can become malignant, such as breast, lung, liver, and skin, and even within a particular tumor there is heterogeneity, with certain cancer cells in a patient bearing specific cellular or genetic biomarkers which others lack. It has only been in recent years that technology has progressed far enough to enable researchers to understand many cancers at a cellular and molecular level, attribute specific cancers to associated genetic changes, and determine the extent to which these changes are seen in a patient&#8217;s tumor.

Cancer cells contain genetic alterations compared to normal human cells. Common genetic abnormalities correlated to cancer include gains or losses of genetic material on specific chromosomal regions, or loci, or changes in specific genes, or mutations, which ultimately result in detrimental cellular changes followed by cancerous or pre-cancerous conditions. For example, multiple gains or losses on various chromosomes, and the rearrangement of genetic material among chromosomes, or chromosomal translocations, have been observed in different cancer types, such as HER2 in breast cancer and ALK rearrangements in NSCLC. In addition, mutations within gene sequences, or single nucleotide variations, can give rise to aberrant proteins that do not perform their functions correctly, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Such genetic alterations can be a result of multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental or lifestyle factors or viral infections. Importantly, these genetic changes can be used as biomarkers to help guide appropriate treatment. Detecting these biomarkers, particularly those representing drug targets, or those indicative of responsiveness or resistance of a tumor&#8217;s cells to specific therapies, helps clinicians to select drugs, design treatment regimens and optimize patient care and management. Assays that provide such predictive information have the potential to dramatically improve treatment outcomes for patients suffering from cancer.

Limitations of Traditional Cancer Diagnostic and Profiling Approaches 

Cancer is difficult to diagnose and manage due to its heterogeneity at morphologic, genetic and clinical levels. Traditional methods of diagnosis for solid tumors, routinely used as the initial step in cancer detection, involve a tissue biopsy followed by a pathologist examining a thin slice of potentially cancerous tissue under a microscope. A recently obtained tissue sample is used in combination with chemical staining techniques to enable analysis of the biopsy. After staining, the pathologist determines through visual inspection whether the biopsy contains normal or cancerous cells, with those that are deemed cancerous being graded on a level of aggressiveness. Often an analysis of biomarkers relevant to that tumor type is also performed on the tissue, ranging from IHC to FISH, to mutation analysis by various means such as microarrays and sequencing. After the diagnosis, a clinical workup is performed according to established guidelines for the specific cancer type. From there, the physician determines the stage of progression of the cancer based on a series of clinical measures, such as size, grade, metastasis risk, symptoms and patient history, and decides on a treatment plan that may include surgery, watchful waiting, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation.

This type of analysis is dependent on the availability of a recently obtained tissue biopsy for the pathologist to analyze. Such a biopsy is often not available. A tumor may not be readily accessible for biopsy, a patient&#8217;s condition may be such that a biopsy is not advised, and for routine periodic patient monitoring to evaluate potential progression or recurrence, a biopsy is a fairly invasive procedure and not typically performed. As the length of time between when the original biopsy, diagnosis or surgery is conducted to the current evaluation of the patient increases, the likelihood that an original biopsy specimen is truly representative of the current disease condition declines, as does the usefulness of the original biopsy for making treatment decisions. This risk intensifies in situations where a drug therapy is being administered, because the drug can put selective pressure on the tumor cells to adapt and change.

Similarly, the heterogeneity referred to above means that different parts or areas of the same tumor can have different molecular features or properties. In evaluating a biopsy specimen, the pathologist will take a few thin slices of the tumor for microscopic review rather than exhaustively analyzing the whole tumor mass. The pathologist can only report on the tumor sections analyzed and if other parts of the tumor have different features, such as biomarkers corresponding to specific treatments, they can be missed. A more representative analysis of the entire tumor, as well as any metastases if they are present, is very helpful.

CTCs, ctDNA and Cancer

CTCs are cancer cells that have detached from the tumor matrix and invaded the patient&#8217;s blood or other bodily fluids. These cells are representative of the tumor and its metastases, and can function as their surrogates. Testing CTCs can complement pathologic information drawn from a biopsy or resected tissue sample, helping to insure that the analysis is comprehensive and not biased by tumor heterogeneity and sampling issues. They can also provide critical data when a biopsy is not possible. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the presence and number of CTCs provides information on the likely course of certain types of disease for the cancer patient, or in other words they are considered &#8220;prognostic.&#8221; Since CTCs are representative of the tumor, they can also be used for biomarker analysis, such as helping to guide therapy selection. Such analyses are &#8220;predictive&#8221; in that they offer insight into the likely responsiveness or resistance to particular therapies. After surgery and during any subsequent therapy or monitoring period, blood samples can periodically be drawn in a standard manner and analyzed to evaluate a therapy&#8217;s continuing effectiveness, as well as to detect other biomarkers such as new genetic mutations that may arise as a result of selection pressure by a particular therapy or by chance. Physicians can use this information to determine which therapy is most likely to benefit their patients at particular times through the course of their disease. Treatment decisions based on patient-specific information are the foundation of personalized medicine, and assays that guide a physician in the selection of individualized therapy for a patient are termed &#8220;predictive assays.&#8221;

ctDNA is nucleic acid that is released into blood by dying tumor cells. Cell death occurs in all tissues, especially those that are rapidly dividing, and in cancer, where cell growth is not only rapid but also uncontrolled. Parts of tumors often outgrow their blood supply, resulting in cell death. Tumor cells dying as a result of therapy also release nucleic acid into blood. As a consequence, ctDNA is common in cancer patients and scientists believe that like CTCs, it may be more representative of a patient&#8217;s entire tumor than a few thin sections from a tissue biopsy, thus reducing the heterogeneity problem. ctDNA is found in the plasma component of blood and is readily accessible in a standard blood sample. Analyzing ctDNA for mutations that are used as biomarkers for therapy selection shows great promise. One of the strengths of this approach, in addition to not requiring a tissue biopsy, is that it is not dependent on capturing rare tumor cells from blood to provide a sample for testing. The difficulty with this approach is that the cellular context is lost since the ctDNA is mixed with a much larger amount of circulating DNA from normal cells that are continuously dying and being replaced in the body, thus making analysis challenging. This requires a mutation detection methodology with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, to distinguish mutations in particular gene regions in cancer cells from the normal gene sequence present in those same genes in normal cells which co-exist in blood as normal cells die and are replaced in the body. Our Target-Selector technology provides this necessary sensitivity and specificity and creates an opportunity for ctDNA analysis to complement CTC analysis, or potentially to serve as the platform for stand-alone assays.

Given the incidence of cancer in the United States, with an estimated 925,000 new cases in 2014 for the major solid tumors targeted by our planned assay products, the markets for our current and planned cancer diagnostic assays are very large. Furthermore, 

these m arket opportunities are even greater due to the benefits of CTC and ctDNA testing, including not only the ability to offer physicians a simple way to augment an initial tumor biopsy analysis but also to provide a means for relatively frequent monitoring of the tumor&#8217;s molecular status, utilizing a standard blood sample as a &#8220;liquid biopsy.&#8221; The latter application enables the physician to determine if or how a tumor is changing over time or is responding to therapy and what the next treatment should be. For example, in the United States, the incidence of new cases of breast cancer alone is estimated to be over 230,000 in 2014, and the prevalence of this disease is over 2.8 million (the number of women with a history of breast cancer in the United States, incl uding women being treated and women who have finished treatment), with an estimated 330,000 lumpectomies performed annually in the United States. Of these lumpectomies, 20% need to be repeated because on pathological examination it is shown the procedure d id not result in &#8220;clean margins,&#8221; thus suggesting not all the tumor was removed, according to a Johns Hopkins report. If a CTC assay were performed at the time of initial diagnosis, at the time of surgery, or in lieu of, or as an adjunct to, a PET/CT scan (as a CTC assay has the potential to identify a single tumor cell in a blood sample, while a scan requires a tumor mass of millions of cells to be detectable), to monitor disease progression or test for recurrence, thousands of assays, in breast cancer alo ne, could be performed per year with still relatively low market penetration. 

Use of CTC- and ctDNA-Derived Biomarker Data in Cancer Treatment

CTCs and ctDNA are derived from, and are understood to be representative of, a solid tumor and its metastases and can be analyzed as adjuncts to or in place of the tumor, especially when a recent tumor biopsy is not available. This is also referred to as a liquid biopsy. In theory, almost any analysis that can be performed on tumor tissue can also be performed on CTCs, while ctDNA, because it is only nucleic acid, is more limited. We have focused our analysis of CTCs and ctDNA on known biomarkers associated with specific therapies to support treatment decisions and therapy selection made by physicians. The biomarkers we analyze consist of proteins or protein modifications that can be identified by immunocytochemical means, cytogenetic or chromosomal aberrations, which are detected by FISH. Gene mutations which are detected in CTCs or ctDNA by molecular diagnostic assays, including Target-Selector techniques and gene sequencing. Specific examples include (i) for ICC, the detection of the estrogen receptor protein in breast cancer, indicative of the likely responsiveness to hormonal therapies like tamoxifen, often sold under the trade name Nolvadex &#174; , (ii) for FISH, the presence of an amplified HER2 gene in breast cancer, indicative of the likely responsiveness to HER2-targeted agents like trastuzumab, often sold under the trade name Herceptin &#174; , and (iii) for mutation detection, the presence of an EGFR activating mutation in NSCLC like L858R, indicative of the likely responsiveness to EGFR-targeted agents like Tarceva &#174; . All of these biomarkers are currently tested on tumor tissue and can be tested on CTCs, and in the latter case on ctDNA. The resulting information could then be used to guide patient care, and specifically treatment selection.

To date, these types of molecular and genetic detection methods have been successfully utilized to provide predictive information for several cancers including breast, colon, NSCLC, melanoma and others in the form of companion diagnostics, typically performed on tumor tissue. CTC and ctDNA assays, which analyze the same biomarkers in a more convenient standard blood sample test that also permits periodic monitoring, could be used in the same way.

Our Business Strategy

We plan to provide oncologists and other physicians with a straightforward means to profile and characterize their patients&#8217; tumors on a real-time basis by analyzing CTCs and ctDNA found in standard blood draws. Biomarkers are currently detected and analyzed primarily in tissue biopsy specimens. We believe that our technology, which not only provides information on CTC enumeration but also the assessment of treatment-associated biomarkers identified within the CTCs or in ctDNA, will provide information to physicians that improves patient treatment and management and will become a key component in the standard of care for personalized cancer treatment.

Our approach is to develop and commercialize CTC and ctDNA assays and services to enable us to offer to oncologists standard blood sample based, real-time, testing solutions for a range of solid tumor types to improve patient treatment with better prognostic and predictive tools. To achieve this, we intend to:

&#183; 

Develop and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary CTC and ctDNA assays and services, to enable physicians to develop personalized treatment plans. We intend to continue the development of additional prognostic and predictive assays and services to provide information that is essential to personalized cancer treatment. By including predictive information on biomarkers associated with specific therapies in our analysis in addition to CTC enumeration, our assays are designed to provide a more complete profile of a patient&#8217;s disease than existing CTC tests. The biomarker information will assist physicians in selecting appropriate therapies for individual patients. Our ctDNA assays are expected to offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity based on the Target-Selector technology, enabling earlier detection of therapy-associated mutation targets or resistance markers, again supporting treatment decisions. We have launched our Target-Selector offering in a number of key indications such as breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma, which are performed in our CLIA-accredited testing facility. We plan to perform the necessary validation studies to allow us to commercialize these assays through our clinical laboratory. 

&#183; 

Scale our internal sales and marketing capabilities. We are a ctively seeking additional partners to increase our market reach. Our specialized sales force with experience in cancer diagnostic testing focuses on key identified territories in order to provide geographic coverage throughout the United States. At Decemb er 31, 2015, we had 11 sales representatives, and depending on our assay volume, we expect to increase this group to 15-20 within two years and potentially 40-50 within five years. This team will educate physicians directly on the benefits of our assays an d the clinical data supporting them, as well as provide support to and serve as technical specialists for our partners. 

&#183; 

Develop and expand our collaborations with leading university hospitals and research centers. We collaborate with key thought leaders, physicians and clinical researchers, including those at Washington Universiry, University of California, Irvine, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, University of Colorado,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the University of California, San Diego, Yale University and Columbia University. Our collaborations enable us to test new technologies, validate the effectiveness and utility of our planned assays in a clinical setting and provide us access to clinically well-characterized and highly annotated patient data. These samples and data accelerate our validation process and facilitate the testing and refinement of our planned new assays. 

&#183; 

Enhance our efforts in reaching and educating oncologists and other physicians about CTC and ctDNA assays. According to the State of Cancer Care in America 2014 Report, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in March of 2014, there were approximately 13,000 medical oncologists in the United States or 15,500 if gynecologic and pediatric oncologists are included. With the support of our key thought leader collaborators, we intend to focus on oncologists and other physicians who treat cancer patients by targeting our sales and marketing efforts on this important customer segment. We believe this will expand and optimize the oncology testing services and personalization of cancer treatment provided by oncologists and other physicians so that they can better serve their cancer patients. 

&#183; 

Increase our efforts to provide biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations with our current and planned CTC and ctDNA assays and services. Oncology drugs have the potential to be among the most personalized of therapeutics, yet oncology drugs have one of the worst approval rates, at 11% for leading indications and 2% for secondary indications of cancer drug compounds from first administration in humans to approval (2004-2011, Biotechnology Industry Organization). In an effort to improve the outcome of clinical trials for oncology drugs, and more rapidly advance targeted therapeutics, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking to companies that have cancer diagnostic assays that specifically address their needs, including the ability to characterize and monitor a patient&#8217;s tumor over time using CTC and ctDNA assays to analyze biomarkers of interest. There are over 5,000 active trials in the United States in breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and gastric cancers and melanoma according to clinicaltrials.gov. We expect to increase our sales and marketing focus in this business as well as seek additional collaborations and partnerships with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. 

&#183; 

Conduct additional clinical studies of breast cancer, NSCLC and other CTC and ctDNA assays we plan to introduce. Clinical utility and validation studies for our planned ctDNA assays may rely on archived plasma or blood samples from clinical trials in which patient outcomes are already available, in a retrospective-prospective design that significantly shortens the length of such studies. 

&#183; 

Continue to enhance our current and planned CTC and ctDNA assays and reduce the costs associated with providing them through internal research and development and partnering with leading technology developers and reagent suppliers. We intend to work closely with select key technology developers and suppliers to further automate the optical interpretation of our current assays and our planned additional CTC assays, including enumeration, immunocytochemical biomarker staining and FISH. We also intend to reduce the costs associated with key material components of these assays, including FISH probes. We have and currently utilize a technology provides an automation system that significantly reduces the hands-on time of our cytogenetic technologists for microfluidic channel analysis while increasing the uniformity of the data we generate. This system is also expected to provide the ability to evaluate multiple fluorescent signals of different wavelengths simultaneously for multiplexed analysis, again enhancing efficiency. 

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the competitive advantages of our molecular assays, including our assays which are still under development, would include the following. 

Our current Target Selector molecular assays enable, and we anticipate our planned CTC and ctDNA assays will each enable, detailed analysis of a patient&#8217;s cancer utilizing a standard blood sample, facilitating testing at any time, including when a biopsy is not available or inconclusive, offering real-time monitoring of the cancer and the response of the cancer to therapy, and allowing oncologists and other physicians to select timely modifications to treatment regimens. Because CTCs and ctDNA are derived from the primary tumor or its metastases, they function as surrogates for the tumor, with the advantage of being readily accessible in a standard blood sample. This is especially important in situations where a biopsy is not available or advised. The simplicity of obtaining a standard blood sample permits repeat testing in a monitoring mode to detect recurrence or progression and to offer information on treatment modifications based on a current assessment of the cancer&#8217;s properties. A key advantage to using Biocept is our ability to interrogate both CTC and ctDNA biomarker targets. 

Our current Target Selector assays each provi de, and we anticipate our planned assays will each provide, more information than competitors&#8217; existing tests, including predictive information on biomarkers associated with specific therapies. We anticipate that such additional biomarker information will enable a physician to develop a personalized treatment plan. By including biomarker information in our analysis, in addition to CTC enumeration, our current assays and our planned assays are designed to provide a more complete profile of a patient&#8217;s diseas e than existing CTC or ctDNA. We intend for our assays to contain actionable information to assist physicians in selecting appropriate therapies for individual patients. Our ctDNA assays are expected to offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity based on o ur technology, enabling earlier detection of therapy-associated mutation targets or resistance markers, again supporting treatment decisions. 

Our current Target Selector and our planned future assays are designed to capture and detect a broader range of CTCs than existing tests and to be applicable to, or quickly modifiable for, a wide range of cancer types. Our antibody capture cocktail includes antibodies targeting not only EpCAM, the traditional epithelial CTC capture antigen utilized in the CellSearch &#174; system and in other platforms, but also other epithelial antigens as well as mesenchymal and cancer stem cell antigens, indicative of cells having undergone the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These cells may be more relevant for metastasis. Our detection methods include cytokeratin staining with a broader range of cytokeratin isotypes than existing CTC tests, and we have introduced additional staining which would enable detection of cells specifically captured with our antibody cocktail, including EMT cells lacking cytokeratin. We believe that through our enhanced staining, more CTCs and different types of CTCs will be able to be identified and potentially at earlier stages of disease, resulting in fewer non-informative cases and more information for physicians. 

Our current and planned CTC and ctDNA Target Selector assays will be, flexible and readily configurable to accommodate new biomarkers with clinical relevance as they are identified. In theory, our platforms permit essentially any analysis that is currently performed on tumor tissue to be performed on CTCs, including immunocytochemical staining, FISH and molecular analysis. As new therapies are approved, and to the extent that they are targeted therapies for which knowledge of a particular gene amplification event, mutation or presence, absence or modification, such as phosphorylation, of a protein are indicative of likely response or resistance to that therapy, we will be able to include them in our assays with minimal changes. This is attractive to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing such therapies, or seeking ways to make their clinical trials more efficient, as this flexibility would enable them to focus on patients more likely to respond to a particular therapy and demonstrate a benefit from that therapy. 

Collaborative relationships with physicians at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Irvine, University of Colorado, Yale University, Sara Cannon Research Institute, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Columbia University. We have worked closely with a number of physicians at institutions on various collaborative projects in different cancer types including breast, NSCLC, prostate, colorectal, ovarian, bladder, renal and endometrial. These projects provide us access to leading researchers, clinicians and key thought leaders, access to valuable patient samples and insight into clinical applications for our assays. Some of these projects have resulted in publications in leading journals, such as Cancer Discovery and Cancer Medicine , which enhances our standing in the oncology community and supports our marketing efforts. 

Our planned TargetSelector mutation assays would not be platform dependent. These assays are being designed to be able to be performed on almost any molecular instrument, which will provide flexibility in laboratory operations. To the extent we elect to develop these assays as IVDs, including pursuing CE marks for them to be marketed outside the United States, the ability to rapidly deploy them on different approved instrument platforms already in many laboratories should greatly simplify their distribution and commercialization. 

Our Assays and Services

We have launched our Target-Selector offering for breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma, and plan to continue to launch a series of assays for different predictive biomarkers. Our current assays and our planned assays under the Target-Selector offering would be, LDTs. FDA clearance or approval is not currently required to offer these types of assays in our laboratory once they have been clinically and analytically validated. We seek licenses and approvals for our laboratory facility and for LDTs from the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, which oversees CLIA, and various state regulatory bodies. Certain states, such as New York, require us to obtain state licensure in order for us to perform testing on specimens taken from patients or received from ordering physicians from those states. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed on a product-specific basis by New York as an out of state laboratory and our products, as LDTs, must be approved by the New York State Department of Health before they are offered in New York. As part of this process, the State of New York requires validation of our assays. We are currently in the process of addressing the requirements for licensure in New York, and we have obtained all required licenses and approvals from all other states requiring licensure of out-of-state laboratories. (We were required to re-license in these other states as a result of our July 2013 reincorporation to Delaware.)

Our Marketed Assays 

Breast Cancer. Our breast cancer assay was the first test developed and we are currently offering it to physicians through our CLIA laboratory. It is based on a standard blood sample and can be used at the time of diagnosis and for monitoring, including at the time of progression or recurrence. This allows the physician to characterize the tumor to help define treatment options, either augmenting tissue analysis or replacing it when a tumor biopsy is not available. The assay currently includes the determination of HER2 status by FISH and ICC analysis of ER and Androgen Receptor, or AR. HER2 status is used by physicians to determine suitability of a patient for treatment with HER2-targeted therapeutics. ER status provides information on suitability of breast cancer patients for endocrine or hormonal therapies. AR status is of emerging predictive value in triple-negative breast cancer. We plan to add ICC analysis for progesterone receptor, which will also provide information on suitability of breast cancer patients for endocrine or hormonal therapies. 

Lung Cancer. Up to 25% of lung cancer patients, especially those diagnosed at Stage IIIB or Stage IV, do not have sufficient tissue for molecular profiling for various reasons, including tumor accessibility and status of the patient. In these cases, CTC and ctDNA assays are alternatives for obtaining more detailed information about the molecular status of the tumor that helps the physician select appropriate therapy. The Target-Selector assay&#8217;s biomarker specific analysis currently includes FISH testing for ALK and ROS gene rearrangements and molecular analysis of the mutations of the EGFR (in exons 19, 20 and 21), KRAS and BRAF genes. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is a resistance mutation seen in ~50% of patients undergoing treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In addition, we offer lung cancer resistance testing to analyze for the presence of the T790M mutation as well as FISH analysis for C-MET and HER2 gene amplification. We plan to add FISH testing for RET gene rearrangements. 

The L858R mutation of the EGFR gene and Exon 19 deletions are activators of EGFR kinase activity. The codon 12 and 13 mutations of the K-RAS gene are associated with non-responsiveness to the EGFR kinase inhibitors, and the codon 600 mutations of the B-RAF gene have a prevalence of ~ 3% in lung cancer. 

Gastric Cancer. Our Target-Selector assay for gastric cancer is based on the identification of HER2 as a biomarker for this disease. We employ our CTC HER2 FISH assay, which we previously developed for breast cancer, for the analysis of gastric cancer CTCs. Current clinical practice relies on a biopsy for tumor tissue analysis to detect elevated HER2, in the same manner as is done for breast cancer. Our assays circumvent this need for tissue, as well as providing straightforward monitoring of HER2 status from a standard blood sample, on a real-time basis during treatment. 

Melanoma. Our Target-Selector melanoma assay is performed on a standard blood sample, and provides information on the presence or absence and specific nature of the V600 mutation in the B-RAF gene, which indicates whether the B-RAF inhibitors are candidate therapies for the patient. 

Colon Cancer. Our Target-Selector assay for colorectal cancer offers mutation testing analogous to that performed in lung cancer, namely detection of key mutations in the K-RAS and B-RAF genes. Testing on the K-RAS gene will focus on codons 12 and 13 mutations, while testing on the B-RAF gene will focus on V600 mutations. 

This testing is important because certain targeted therapies for colorectal cancer, including the monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR are ineffective in patients who have a K-RAS mutation, which is found in up to 40% of cases according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. While for each of codons 12 and 13 in K-RAS, up to 15-20 mutations have been reported, there are reports in the scientific literature that patients with one particular mutation, G13D, do respond well and that there may be variability in response to different chemotherapies based on the specific K-RAS mutation, suggesting that detailed information on mutation status is clinically relevant.

Prostate Cancer. Our Target-Selector assay for prostate cancer is based on the analysis of CTCs found in a standard blood sample. We currently offer testing for AR. We plan to validate testing for PTEN gene deletions by FISH. 

The androgen receptor normally binds the hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and is the target for several drug molecules, including those acting directly as antagonists for the receptor and those acting indirectly through inhibition of androgen synthesis.

PTEN, an enzyme that functions as a tumor suppressor, if mutated, deleted or otherwise functionally disrupted, removes a brake from cell replication and allows uncontrolled growth, which is seen in many cancers. If PTEN is mutated, deleted or disrupted, chemotherapy or polytherapy is usually recommended.

Laboratory Testing

From our CLIA-certified laboratory in San Diego, California, we plan to provide test results from our current and planned CTC and ctDNA assays to oncologists and other physicians in community hospitals, cancer centers, group practices and offices. At the 

federal level, clinical laboratories, such as ours, must be certified under CLIA in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. Our laboratory is also accredited by CAP, which is one of six accreditation organizations approved by the Centers for Medicare and Med icaid Services, or CMS, under CLIA. Our clinical laboratory is located in California and we hold the requisite license from the California Department of Public Health to operate our laboratory. In addition, we hold licenses issued by the states of Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island to test specimens from patients in those states or received from ordering physicians from those states. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed on a product-specific basis by New Yo rk as an out of state laboratory and our products, as LDTs, must be approved by the New York State Department of Health before they are offered in New York. As part of this process, the State of New York requires validation of our assays. We are currently in the process of addressing the requirements for licensure in New York, and we have obtained all required licenses and approvals in all other states requiring licensure of out-of-state laboratories. (We were required to re-license in these other states as a result of our July 2013 reincorporation to Delaware.) 

Clinical Trial Services

Industry research has shown many promising drugs have produced disappointing results in clinical trials. For example, a study by Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto estimated that over a five-year study period 85% of the new therapies for solid tumors which were tested in early clinical trials in the United States, Europe and Japan failed, and that of those that survive through to Phase III trials only half will actually be approved. Given such a high failure rate of oncology drugs in clinical development, combined with constrained budgets for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, there is a significant need for drug developers to utilize molecular diagnostics to help decrease these failure rates. For specific molecular-targeted therapeutics, the identification of appropriate biomarkers may help to optimize clinical trial patient selection and success rates by helping clinicians identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a therapy based on their individual genetic profile.

In addition to testing for physicians and their patients, we plan to offer clinical trials testing services to help increase the efficiency and economic viability of clinical trials for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations. Our clinical trial services will be aimed at developing customizable assays and techniques utilizing CTC and ctDNA technologies to provide sensitive, real-time characterization of individual patient&#8217;s tumors using a standard blood sample. These assays may be useful as, and ultimately developed into, companion diagnostics associated with a specific therapeutic. Additionally, through our services we may gain further insights into biomarkers for disease progression and drug resistance, as well as those associated with current drug development efforts, which we can incorporate into assays.

Assay Development Process

Our Target-Selector assays were, and our planned additional CTC and ctDNA assays are being, developed and validated in conjunction with leading academic and clinical research centers to ensure that the needs of the clinical community are being met with the latest research on key biomarkers that affect patient care. We utilize a research and validation process to help ensure that we are providing diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information that is clinically relevant and accurate. The time-frame for this process from design through development and market launch is dependent upon, among other things, the biomarkers in question having been discovered and validated before we incorporate them in an assay, the specific clinical claims we plan to pursue, and the availability of high quality samples for validation. Our development protocol calls for us to monitor and review the process in four stages as detailed below:

&#183; 

Stage 1, Research . We review known, validated biomarkers, preferably associated with a specific therapeutic or other high value treatment decision, and discuss with clinical collaborators and key thought leaders to characterize the opportunity, the specific clinical setting and the product profile of the candidate assay. 

&#183; 

Stage 2, Assay Development . We design the assay, which typically has two parts: efficient capture of CTCs and/or ctDNA from the targeted cancer type and development of the biomarker assays that will be included. For example, the first part may involve modification of the antibody capture cocktail and the second could include development of specific Target-Selector mutation assays or testing of FISH probes. The assay will be used on normal control specimens and clinical samples to assure performance and the process includes defining the performance characteristics of the assay as well as developing standard protocols for our CLIA-certified, CAP accredited, and state-licensed laboratory, where the assay will ultimately be performed. This assessment includes such features as reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. 

&#183; 

Stage 3, Clinical Validation . When the assay is performing as desired it is validated on clinical samples, typically in comparison to the existing gold standard for that biomarker, which is usually tumor tissue analysis. Depending on the tumor type and specimen requirement, samples are collected from patients through collaborators, or in the case of ctDNA assays, from sample banks, where clinical information on the patients, including outcomes, is already available. 

&#183; 

Stage 4, Availability for Commercialization . As clinical validation is completed and before launch, we take several steps to prepare an assay for marketing as a LDT. We create standard operating procedures and quality assurance and quality control measures to ensure repeatability and high standards of quality. We train both our commercial and laboratory staff on the interpret ation and use of the data. Licenses and approvals for our laboratory to perform or use LDTs have been obtained from the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as CMS, which oversees CLIA, and different state regulatory bodies. 

Our CTC/FISH-based Target-Selector assays, which have already launched, are considered to have completed this assay development process. All other planned assays which are mentioned in this annual report are all considered to currently be in Stage 2 or Stage 3 of this assay development process.

We will be required to seek FDA clearance or approval to expand the commercial use of assays to other laboratories and testing sites in the United States. We will also need to complete additional activities to submit each of these assays for regulatory clearance or approval before commercialization in each of the international markets where we would plan to introduce them.

If the FDA finalizes its current draft guidance on a risk-based framework for regulation of LDTs, our process would also need to allow for obtaining FDA review, clearance or approval, as applicable, which would add delay, expense and risk to our current assay development process.

Research and Development

We incurred research and development expenses of $4.5 million, which represents 3,371% of our net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $2.9 million, which represents 469% of our net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Research and development expenses represented 32% and 17% of our total costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Major components of the research and development expenses were direct personnel costs, laboratory equipment and consumables and overhead expenses.

Technology Development

In addition to developing new CTC and ctDNA assays for different cancers to be offered through our CLIA testing laboratory, and adapting additional predictive biomarkers to these assays as their importance is demonstrated by the scientific and clinical research communities, we continue to focus on improving the base technologies underlying our assays and processes. We are exploring various ways to improve CTC capture efficiency and detection, as well as approaches to sub-categorize CTCs into different populations that may have clinical relevance. For example, by determining which antigens individual CTCs expressed that enabled their capture, we could differentiate, and enumerate, various CTC phenotypes, for example, epithelial versus mesenchymal. We are also working to simplify the assay process, and in general to provide a broader range of useful data on a patient&#8217;s cancer to assist the physician in determining an appropriate treatment. Some of these projects and initiatives include:

&#183; 

Improve Ability to Capture CTCs 

Continued modification and optimization of our microfluidic channel as a way to further enhance CTC capture efficiency. Capture efficiency directly impacts sensitivity, informative rate, and the ability to perform accurate and reliable biomarker analyses on the CTCs, all of which increase the value of our offering. We are utilizing some of our early research experience to improve CTC capture rates and reduce background contamination from normal white blood cells.

&#183; 

Automation of Our Assay Process 

Development of automation throughout the assay process, but particularly at the visual evaluation steps, which include enumeration, any ICC for biomarkers beyond those used to identify CTCs, for example protein biomarkers, and FISH analysis, is a way to drive efficiencies, reduce costs, speed up turnaround time, and generate more reliable, uniform, and in some cases more sensitive data. We have identified an automation solution for the visual analysis, which is being validated in our CLIA laboratory. We have also adapted a semi-automated system for the separation, processing and washing steps before running a sample on the microfluidic channel, which is now being used in the research laboratory and similarly needs to be transferred and validated in the CLIA laboratory. These measures will reduce costs and time as well as allow for higher-throughput as sample volumes increase.

&#183; 

Development of Second Generation Platform for CTC Testing 

Evaluating and developing techniques for CTC capture that take advantage of our antibody enrichment cocktail and our staining technology to modify our current CTC process to a simpler, essentially IVD, format. In addition to reducing internal costs, such an advance would offer the opportunity for us to offer a product format that enable us to access the worldwide CTC testing market. The distribution of such kits could create a new business opportunity for us.

&#183; 

Utilization of ctDNA Technology for Highly Multiplexed Mutation Testing 

The ctDNA technology should enable us to multiplex mutation testing such that larger panels of genes can be analyzed in a single step and interfaced with genetic sequencing. This should position us for the analysis at the molecular level of whole signaling pathways or enzyme cascades. We plan to take advantage of the sensitivity and specificity of the ctDNA technology and leverage interest in the clinical research community for detecting any actionable biomarker in a particular tumor, as opposed to only those that are known to occur at relatively higher frequencies in that type of tumor. Such multiplexed mutation assays, relying on our ctDNA technology, could provide a more global evaluation of a tumor through analysis of either CTCs or ctDNA. This would offer a broader range of potential treatment options as well as enable the monitoring of the effectiveness of those treatments over time.

&#183; 

Development of Single Cell CTC Isolation Techniques for Molecular Analysis 

Tumor heterogeneity is a well-recognized problem for tissue analysis and is in part addressed by focusing on CTCs, which may provide a more universal sampling of a tumor. One result of this can be a diverse population of CTCs in a sample, with different phenotypes and genotypes represented. We are working with a collaborator on techniques for subsequent sorting of our highly enriched CTC samples released from our microfluidic channels into pools of CTCs with similar phenotypes, and ultimately to single CTCs, for molecular analysis.

Translational/Clinical Research

In the course of our research and validation studies, we have processed thousands of cancer patient samples and normal control samples for analysis. Our initial focus has been on breast cancer, where validation studies for our CTC assay, including enumeration of CTCs on the Biocept platform compared to the CellSearch &#174; system, and HER2 FISH performed on CTCs and compared with HER2 analysis performed on tumor tissue from the same patients, involved over 120 patient samples. The results of our validation studies, and the demonstration of a reliable and reproducible method for CTC capture and analysis using our platform were published in a paper entitled &#8220;Novel Platform for the Detection of Cytokeratin Positive (CK+) and Cytokeratin Negative (CK+) CTCs&#8221; appearing in the December 2011 issue of Cancer Discovery and a paper entitled &#8220;Efficient capture of circulating tumor cells with a novel immunocytochemical microfluidic device&#8221; appearing in the September 2011 issue of BioMicrofluidics .

Additional studies were conducted in breast and other tumor types, including lung, prostate and colorectal cancers, utilizing patient samples for comparison to the CellSearch &#174; system. In head-to-head studies, our system detected cytokeratin positive CTCs in comparable numbers of breast cancer patients, and in considerably more patients in the other cancer types ( Cancer Discovery , December 2011). Moreover, the results clearly demonstrated that our use of our antibody enrichment cocktail enabled recovery of more CTCs as compared to using only anti-EpCAM antibodies. This data served as a clinical validation study for CTC enumeration. When our staining is applied to detect cytokeratin-negative CTCs, we expect to see far more CTCs based on preliminary studies reported in a paper entitled &#8220;Detection of EpCAM-Negative and Cytokeratin-Negative CTCs in Peripheral Blood&#8221; appearing in the 2011 issue of the Journal of Oncology .

Our system has the added advantage of post-capture immunocytochemical, cytogenetic and molecular genomic analyses of the CTCs. Our system captured cells can be analyzed directly within the microfluidic channel, thereby removing the need to re-deposit cells on a slide, which could result in cell loss or damage. Furthermore, given the transparency of the microfluidic channel, it can be immediately analyzed on a microscope. Together these two important features allow for a very efficient process that is well suited for a LDT performed in a CLIA laboratory. The post-capture analyses, which focus on the evaluation of biomarkers, are particularly important and valuable to physicians and patients, as they focus on actionable information related to therapy selection. We have performed a number of clinical research studies in collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators involving various tumor types, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, lung, colorectal, bladder and prostate cancers.

In a collaboration with physicians and researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, we evaluated matched samples of tumor tissue, blood for CTCs and bone marrow for DTCs in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients for evidence of HER2 amplification, which would indicate eligibility for HER2-targeted therapies like Herceptin &#174; , a potentially life-saving treatment. These results were also presented at both the 2011 and 2012 annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. In a study published in Cancer Medicine (2013, 2(2) 226-233) and involving 96 patients, HER2 positive CTCs and/or DTCs were identified in 18.8% of cases in which the primary tumor was HER2 negative. In the same cohort of patients, only 12.5% were HER2 positive in their primary tumor. In other words, beyond the 12 (of the 96) which traditional tumor tissue analysis had indicated could benefit from Herceptin-based therapy, the Target-Selector assay detected 18 (of the 96) patients who (despite the fact they were identified as being HER2 negative by primary-tumor testing) could benefit from Herceptin-based therapy. Patients classified as HER2 negative based on tumor tissue and found to have HER2 positive CTCs and/or DTCs will continue to be followed by our collaborators at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to assess their overall and progression-free survival. Tumor heterogeneity is one likely cause of the discordance for HER2 status between tumor tissue and our assay performed on blood and bone marrow samples. Tumor heterogeneity indicates an important clinical application for the Target-Selector assay, confirmation 

and crosschecking of the tissue analysis p erformed by the pathologist at the time of biopsy or surgery, especially if HER2 negative, with a CTC analysis derived from a standard blood sample. 

Clinical utility studies, which demonstrate the specific clinical setting in which a particular CTC or ctDNA assay is used, and how to use the information generated for medical, specifically treatment-related, decision making is a key part of our strategy and research and development plan. Data resulting from such studies is critical not only in the sales and marketing process, but also for reimbursement, as many payors now ask for peer-reviewed publications describing such studies and results before agreeing to coverage of a specific assay. We are involved in and plan to become involved in numerous studies to further demonstrate the clinical utility of our assays.

Sales and Marketing

At December 31, 2015, our sales organization consisted of 11 sales representatives placed in strategic locations around the country that have high concentrations of cancer patients, and we may, depending on assay volume, potentially grow this number to 15-20 sales representatives within two years and to 40-50 within five years. We have defined the initial sales territories and have hired sales professionals with an average of over 16 years of successful experience in clinical oncology sales or oncology diagnostic testing sales from leading biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical or specialty reference laboratory companies. We plan on growing this specialized, oncology-focused sales force and supporting it with clinical specialists who bring significant technical knowledge in the use of CTC and ctDNA assays. We have also invested in sales headcount focusing on biopharma clinical trial opportunities. 

Finally, we have invested in a managed care sales and marketing expert in order to pursue favorable payment and coverage for our testing. The key value proposition for these customers will be focused on cost savings by offering our assays as alternatives to expensive surgeries when tumor biopsy tissue is not available.

Our sales and marketing efforts are and will be based on a five-part marketing strategy:

&#183; 

Work with oncologists, other physicians and group practices at community hospitals and cancer centers to educate them on the advantages and opportunities that CTC and ctDNA assays provide for better information, allowing them to select the most appropriate therapy for their patients, and how and when these assays are most effectively used; 

&#183; 

Build relationships with key thought leaders in oncology, specifically in the cancers for which we are offering or plan to offer assays, to educate and support community oncologists; 

&#183; 

Collaborate with leading research universities and institutions that enable the validation of our new assays, as well as the generation of clinical utility data; 

&#183; 

Partner with pharmaceutical companies for clinical trial work focusing on CTC and ctDNA testing and analysis; and 

&#183; 

Add value for the payor community by avoiding costly surgeries by providing the option of a simple blood test. 

We also take advantage of customary marketing channels commonly used by the diagnostic and pharmaceutical industries, such as medical meetings, broad-based publication of our scientific and clinical data, and the Internet. In addition, we provide easy-to-access information to our customers through our website and a data portal for physicians who wish to access test results electronically. Our customers value easily accessible information in order to quickly review their patients&#8217; information and begin developing a treatment protocol.

Outside the United States

Outside the United States, where a central laboratory business model is less developed, we will evaluate opportunities with our existing and other partners for the conversion and/or development of our current and planned CTC and ctDNA assays to test systems or IVDs, and related strategies to develop and serve such regional oncology markets. We also plan to sell our clinical trial services to biopharmaceutical companies and research organizations outside the United States.

We plan to cooperate with partners on accessing markets internationally. We plan for this to be accomplished either through partnerships with local groups and distributors or the development of IVDs and/or test systems, including instrumentation.

Competition 

As a cancer diagnostics company focused on current and planned assays for CTCs and ctDNA from standard blood samples, we rely extensively on our ability to combine novel technology and biomarker information with high-quality, state-of-the art clinical laboratory testing. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of:

&#183; 

our ability to utilize standard blood samples, enabling testing of patients frequently through the course of their disease without a biopsy, thereby reducing cost and trauma, saving time, and providing real-time information on the current status of the tumor; 

&#183; 

our ability to include biomarker information in our analysis, in addition to CTC enumeration, thereby providing a more complete profile of a patient&#8217;s disease than existing CTC tests can. This is actionable information that can assist physicians in selecting more personalized treatment plans for individual patients; 

&#183; 

our current and planned CTC assays&#8217; ability to capture and detect a broader range of CTC phenotypes than existing tests, and potentially at earlier stages of disease, resulting in fewer non-informative cases and more information for physicians. For example, our antibody capture cocktail targets not only EpCAM but also other epithelial antigens as well as mesenchymal and cancer stem cell antigens, indicative of cells having undergone the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These cells may be more relevant for metastasis; 

&#183; 

our ability to rapidly integrate new biomarkers, either validated in academic laboratories or of interest to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies in the context of their new therapies, into our current and planned assays, facilitating the expansion of actionable information for oncologists and other physicians; 

&#183; 

our research and clinical collaborations with key academic and clinical study groups, which enhance our research and development resources and, by enhancing our standing in the oncology community, support our marketing efforts; and 

&#183; 

our planned ctDNA assays based on our technology are expected to offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting mutation targets or resistance markers, again supporting treatment decisions. 

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so in the future or that new products or assays that perform better than our current and planned assays and services will not be introduced. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to:

&#183; 

expand and enhance our current and planned Target-Selector assays to provide clinically meaningful information in additional cancers; 

&#183; 

work with clinicians to design and implement clinical studies that demonstrate the clinical utility of our products; 

&#183; 

continue to innovate and maintain scientifically advanced technology; 

&#183; 

successfully market and sell assays; 

&#183; 

continue to comply with regulatory guidelines and obtain appropriate regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad as applicable; 

&#183; 

continue to validate our pipeline of assays; 

&#183; 

conduct or collaborate with clinical utility studies to demonstrate the application and medical value of our assays; 

&#183; 

seek to obtain positive coverage and reimbursement decisions from Medicare and private third-party payors; 

&#183; 

continue to enter into sales and marketing partnerships; 

&#183; 

maintain existing and enter into new research and clinical collaborations with key academic and clinical study groups; 

&#183; 

continue to attract and retain skilled scientific and clinical personnel; 

&#183; 

continue to participate in and gain clinical trial work through biopharma partnerships; 

&#183; 

receive payment for the testing we provide for patients; 

&#183; 

obtain patents or other protection for our technologies, assays and services; and 

&#183; 

obtain and maintain our clinical reference laboratory accreditations and licenses. 

Our principal competition comes from mainstream diagnostic methods, used by pathologists and oncologists and other physicians for many years, which focus on tumor tissue analysis. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of oncologists and other physicians to incorporate our CTC and ctDNA testing, including molecular diagnostic testing, in their practices in conjunction with or instead of tissue biopsies and analysis. In addition, companies offering capital equipment and kits or reagents to 

local pathology laboratories represent another source of potential competition. These kits are used directly by the pathologist, which can facilitate adoption. We plan to focus our marketing and sales efforts on medical oncologists rather than pathologists. 

We also face competition from companies that offer products or are conducting research to develop products for CTC or ctDNA testing in various cancers. CTC and ctDNA testing is a new area of science and we cannot predict what assays others will develop that may compete with or provide results similar or superior to the results we are able to achieve with the assays we develop. Competitors include but are not limited to companies such as Atossa, Qiagen, Roche, Trovagene, Guardant, Janssen Diagnostoric, Alere (Adnagen), Illumina, Apocell, EPIC Sciences, Clearbridge Biomedics, Biodesix, Thermo-Fisher, Foundation Medicine, Neogenomics, Cynvenio Biosystems, Genomic Health, Fluxion Biosciences, RareCells, ScreenCell and Silicon Biosystems. Some of these groups, in addition to operating research and development laboratories, are establishing CLIA-certified testing laboratories while others are focused on selling equipment and reagents.

There are a number of companies which are focused on the oncology diagnostic market, such as Caris, Neogenomics, Agendia and Genoptix, who while not currently offering CTC or ctDNA assays are selling to the medical oncologists and pathologists and could develop or offer CTC or ctDNA assays. Large laboratory services companies such as Sonic USA, Quest and LabCorp provide more generalized cancer diagnostic testing but could also offer a CTC or ctDNA test service. Companies like Abbott, Danaher and others could develop equipment or reagents in the future as well.

Some of our present and potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial and technical resources and development, production and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop lower-priced, less complex assays that payors, pathologists and oncologists and other physicians could view as functionally equivalent to our current or planned future assays, which could force us to lower the list price of our assays and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, technological innovations that result in the creation of enhanced diagnostic tools that are more sensitive or specific than ours may enable other clinical laboratories, hospitals, physicians or medical providers to provide specialized diagnostic assays similar to ours in a more patient-friendly, efficient or cost-effective manner than is currently possible. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase or create market acceptance and sales of our current or planned future assays, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving or sustaining profitability.

We expect that pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus attention and resources on the personalized cancer diagnostic sector as the potential and prevalence of molecularly targeted oncology therapies approved by the FDA along with companion diagnostics increases. For example, the FDA has recently approved three such agents&#8212;Xalkori&#174; from Pfizer Inc. along with its companion anaplastic lymphoma kinase FISH test from Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Zelboraf&#174; from Daiichi-Sankyo/Genentech/Roche along with its companion B-RAF kinase V600 mutation test from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. and Tafinlar&#174; from GlaxoSmithKline along with its companion B-RAF kinase V600 mutation test from bioMerieux. These recent FDA approvals are only the second, third and fourth instances of simultaneous approvals of a drug and companion diagnostic, the first being the 2010 approval of Genentech&#8217;s Herceptin&#174; for HER2 positive breast cancer along with the HercepTest from partner Dako A/S. Our competitors may invent and commercialize technology platforms or assays that compete with ours.

Additionally, projects related to cancer diagnostics and particularly genomics have received increased government funding, both in the United States and internationally. As more information regarding cancer genomics becomes available to the public, we anticipate that more products aimed at identifying targeted treatment options will be developed and that these products may compete with ours. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our current or planned future assays in countries where we did not apply for patents or where our patents have not issued and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their assay by physicians or patients in other countries.

Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers

Some of the components used in our current or planned products are currently sole-source, and substitutes for these components might not be able to be obtained easily or may require substantial design or manufacturing modifications. Any significant problem experienced by one of our sole source suppliers (particularly K.R. Anderson, Inc., which supplies a custom-packaged silicone compound used in our manufacturing) may result in a delay or interruption in the supply of components to us until that supplier cures the problem or an alternative source of the component is located and qualified. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations. The inclusion of substitute components must meet our product specifications and could require us to qualify the new supplier with the appropriate government regulatory authorities.

Patents and Technology

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our products, services, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our products, services, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek 

patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, services and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. 

We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.

Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. 

Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Intellectual Property Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 10 issued U.S. patents, as well as pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding patents and patent applications internationally related to our current business. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we co-owned 2 pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding foreign patents and applications. The patent portfolios for our leading programs as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below. 

Microfluidic Channels . We have 3 issued U.S. patents that are related to our current business, and in 2015 we received issued patents on our microfluidic channel in Japan and Hong Kong, in addition to our earlier allowances in Europe, China, and South Korea., which cover our microfluidic channel technology. Further U.S. and foreign patent application are pending. 

Blood Collection Tubes . In 2015 we received a U.S. patent related to our blood collection tubes, which contain reagents designed to prevent clumping of blood cells and CTCs that could clog the microfluidic channels and disrupt our assays. 

Antibody Enrichment Cocktail . We have 1 issued and 1 pending U.S. patent application, and 1 broadly issued European patent, as well as other corresponding foreign patent applications directed to our antibody capture cocktail technology. This technology includes using antibodies to a number of tumor-associated antigens from cancer cells of both epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype, as well as cancer stem cells. 

Enhanced Staining . We have 1 U.S. pending application as well as its corresponding foreign patent applications directed to this technology. 

Target-Selector Mutation Detection Technology . We co-own 2 pending U.S. patent applications with Aegea Biotechnologies, Inc., or Aegea. Under our agreement with Aegea, we have certain exclusive rights for oncology clinical testing and diagnostics as well as limited exclusive rights for oncology basic and clinical research. Aegea is responsible for the prosecution of 1 U.S. application and their corresponding foreign applications while we are responsible for the prosecution of the rest of U.S. applications and their corresponding foreign applications. Lyle J. Arnold, Ph.D., our Senior Vice-President of Research &#38; Development and Chief Scientific Officer, is the controlling person of Aegea. 

Operations and Production Facilities

Our research and development laboratories, our CLIA-certified, CAP accredited, and state-licensed diagnostic testing laboratory and our manufacturing facility are located in our San Diego, California headquarters. The laboratories employ commercial state-of-the-art equipment as well as custom-made components specific to our CTC process that are generated in a small in-house engineering shop. The manufacturing facility used for the production of our microfluidic channels is a Class 10,000 suite in which polydimethylsiloxane is formed into the base of our proprietary microfluidic channels in a molding process. A glass cover slip suitable for optical analysis is added to seal the channels and make them watertight by making them reactive using plasma techniques. The inside of the microfluidic channels is subsequently chemically derivatized to enable the attachment of binding elements that strongly bind to antibody-tagged or coated CTCs. Because the microfluidic channels have micrometer dimensions, and we are seeking individual cells in a blood sample to interact with the surface of the microfluidic channel, dust particles and other microscopic debris that could clog the channel needs to be avoided.

The process of performing our assays is straightforward. When a health care professional takes a standard blood sample from a patient for CTC or ctDNA testing, he or she will place the blood sample in our blood collection tubes, complete a requisition form, and package the specimen in our shipping kit for direct shipment to us. Once we receive the specimen at our laboratory and we enter all pertinent information about the specimen into our clinical laboratory information system, our laboratory technologists prepare the 

specimen for processing and analysis. Laboratory technologists, including clinical laboratory technologists and clinical laboratory scientists then conduct the analysis, includ ing enumeration of CTCs and biomarker analysis such as FISH. The data, including images and the processed cells, are sent to our in-house or contracted pathologists or a commercialization partner&#8217;s pathologists who are experienced in the analysis and evalu ation requested by the referring oncologist or pathologist. 

After analysis, our in-house or contracted pathologists or a commercialization partner&#8217;s pathologists use laboratory information systems to prepare a comprehensive report, which may include selected relevant images associated with the specimen. Our Internet reporting portal allows a referring oncologist or pathologist to access his or her patient&#8217;s test results in real time in a secure manner that we believe to be compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and other applicable standards. The reports are generated in industry standard .pdf formats which allows for high definition color images to be reproduced clearly. We send the results to the ordering physician and bill the payor through an arrangement we currently have with Xifin, Inc.

Quality Management Program

We are committed to providing reliable and accurate diagnostic testing to our customers. Accurate specimen identification, timely communication of test results, and prompt correction of errors, is critical. We monitor and improve our performance through a variety of methods, including performance improvement indicators, internal proficiency testing and external quality audits conducted by CAP. All quality concerns and incidents are subject to review and analysis, and our procedures are designed to ensure that we are providing the best services possible to our patients and customers. Protection of patient results from misuse and improper access is imperative and electronic and paper results are guarded via password-protection and identification cards.

We have established a Quality Management Program for our laboratory designed to help ensure accurate and timely test results, a consistent high quality of our testing services. The Quality Management Program documents the quality assurance and performance improvement plans and policies, the laboratory quality assurance and quality control procedures that are necessary to ensure that we offer the highest quality of diagnostic testing services. This program is designed to satisfy all the requirements necessary for local and state licensures and accreditation for clinical diagnostic laboratories by CAP. We follow the policies and procedures for patient and employee safety, hazardous waste disposal and fire codes stated in the general laboratory procedure manual. We believe that all pertinent regulations of CLIA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA are satisfied by following the established guidelines and procedures of our Quality Management Program.

In addition to the compulsory proficiency programs and external inspections required by CMS and other regulatory agencies, we have developed a variety of internal systems and procedures to emphasize, monitor and continuously improve the quality of our operations. We maintain internal quality controls by routinely processing specimens with known diagnoses in parallel with patient specimens. We also have an internally administered proficiency program for specimen testing.

The CAP accreditation program involves unannounced on-site inspections of our laboratories. CAP is an independent, non-governmental organization of board-certified pathologists that accredits laboratories nationwide on a voluntary basis and that has been recognized by CMS as an accreditation organization to inspect laboratories to determine adherence to the CLIA standards. 

Third-Party Payor Reimbursement

Revenues from our clinical laboratory testing are derived from several different sources. Depending on the billing arrangement, the instruction of the ordering physician and applicable law, parties that reimburse us for our services include:

&#183; 

third-party payors that provide coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company, a managed care organization or a governmental payor program; 

&#183; 

physicians or other authorized parties, such as hospitals or independent laboratories, that order the testing service or otherwise refer the services to us; 

&#183; 

patients in cases where the patient has no insurance, has insurance that partially covers the testing, or owes a co-payment, co-insurance or deductible amount; 

&#183; 

collaboration partners; or 

&#183; 

biopharmaceutical companies, universities or researchers for clinical trial work. 

We are reimbursed for two categories of testing, anatomic pathology, which includes cell staining and the enumeration component of CTC assays, FISH, ICC and immunofluorescence, and molecular pathology, which includes mutation analysis. Reimbursement under the Medicare program for the diagnostic services that we offer is based on either the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule or the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, each of which is subject to geographic adjustments and is updated annually. Medical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that require a degree of physician supervision, judgment or other physician involvement, such as pathology services, are generally reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, whereas 

clinic al diagnostic laboratory tests are generally reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Some of the services that we provide are genetic and molecular testing, which are reimbursed as clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. 

Regardless of the applicable fee schedule, Medicare payment amounts are established for each CPT code. In addition, under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, Medicare also sets a cap on the amount that it will pay for any individual assay. This cap, usually referred to as the National Limitation Amount, is set at a percentage of the median of all the contractor fee schedule amounts for each billing code.

Medicare also has policies that may limit when we can bill directly for our services and when we must instead bill another provider, such as a hospital. When the testing that we perform is done on a specimen that was collected while the patient was in the hospital, as either an inpatient or outpatient, we may be required to bill the hospital for clinical laboratory services and for the technical component of pathology services. Which party is to be billed depends primarily on whether the service was ordered at least 14 days after the patient&#8217;s discharge from the hospital. Complying with these requirements is complex and time-consuming and may affect our ability to collect for our services. In addition, hospitals may refuse to pay our invoices or may demand pricing that negatively affects our profit margin.

Medicare requires a beneficiary to pay a 20% co-insurance amount for services billed under the Physician Fee Schedule. Medicare covers the remaining 80%. There is currently no patient co-payment or co-insurance amount applicable to testing billed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Patients often have supplemental insurance policies that cover the co-insurance amount for physician services.

Medicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a reference laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. There is currently no national coverage policy regarding the CTC enumeration portion of our testing. Because our laboratory is in California, the regional Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, for California is the relevant MAC for all our testing. The previous MAC for California, Palmetto GBA, LLC, adopted a negative coverage policy for CTC enumeration. The current MAC for California, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC, is adopting the coverage policies from Palmetto GBA. Therefore, the enumeration portion of our testing is not currently covered and we will receive no payment from Medicare for this portion of the service unless and until the coverage policy is changed. Although approximately 75% of commercial cases received in 2015 relate to our Target-Selector biomarker assays, we continue to receive orders for our traditional enumeration testing, which counts disease burden, and therefore the enumeration testing receives no payment from Medicare based upon the existing coverage decision. On November 4, 2013, we submitted a comprehensive dossier explaining to Palmetto GBA and Noridian the benefits of the enumeration testing in order to seek to persuade the MACs to allow coverage for this portion of our testing. Palmetto GBA responded on November 27, 2013, denying our request for Medicare coverage for the CTC enumeration portion of our testing. We have not received any other indications to suggest that the negative coverage determination will be reversed. The CTC enumeration counts disease burden and is a prognostic test, and although valuable, it does not meet many of the medical necessity requirements of Medicare and the payors. We intend to pursue payment for the capture portion of our CTC technology that allows us to run our diagnostic testing for some of our Target-Selector assays. 

Reimbursement rates paid by private third-party payors can vary based on whether we are considered to be an &#8220;in-network&#8221; provider, a participating provider, a covered provider, an &#8220;out-of-network&#8221; provider or a non-participating provider. These definitions can vary among payors, but we are generally considered an &#8220;out-of-network&#8221; or non-participating provider by the vast majority of private third-party payors. An in-network provider usually has a contract with the payor or benefits provider. This contract governs, among other things, service-level agreements and reimbursement rates. In certain instances an insurance company may negotiate an in-network rate for our testing. An in-network provider may have rates that are lower per assay than those that are out-of-network, and that rate can vary widely. The rate varies based on the payor, the testing type and often the specifics of the patient&#8217;s insurance plan. If a laboratory agrees to contract as an in-network provider, it generally expects to receive quicker payment and access to additional covered patients.

Billing and Billing Codes for Third-Party Payor Reimbursement

CPT codes are the main data code set used by physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other health care professionals to report separately-payable clinical laboratory and pathology services for reimbursement purposes. The CPT coding system is maintained and updated on an annual basis by the American Medical Association. We believe there are existing codes that describe nearly all of the other steps in our testing process. We currently use a combination of different codes to bill for our testing and analysis. 

Changes in coding and reimbursement could adversely impact our revenues going forward. There can be no guarantees that Medicare and other payors will establish positive or adequate coverage policies or reimbursement rates.

We are moving forward with plans to obtain reimbursement coverage for the capture components of our assays. For other tests we are able to utilize existing CPT codes from the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. For these 

established CPT codes (for example, the codes for molecular testing, FISH and ICC), positive coverage determinations have been adopted as part of national Medicare policy or under applicable Local Coverage Determinations. Speci fic codes for our assays, however, do not assure an adequate coverage policy or reimbursement rate. Please see the section entitled &#8220;Legislative and Regulatory Changes Impacting Clinical Laboratory Tests&#8221; for further discussion of certain legislative and r egulatory changes to these billing codes and the anticipated impact on our business. 

Coverage and Reimbursement for our Current Assays and our Planned Future Assays

Our Medicare Administrative Contractor has issued a negative coverage determination for the enumeration component of all CTC assays. We have received reimbursement for the enumeration component of our assays from some private payors, including major private third-party payors, based on submission of standard CPT codes. FISH, ICC and Molecular Testing CPT codes are the subject of positive coverage national or local Medicare determinations. We believe these codes can be used to bill for the analysis components of our current and anticipated CTC assays.

We expect these analysis components to have a significantly greater reimbursement value than the enumeration components of our current and anticipated CTC assays, based on a comparison of what we believe CellSearch &#174; enumeration reimbursement rates currently are, versus existing reimbursement rates for analysis components such as FISH and ICC analysis and molecular testing.

We believe, based on research showing that approximately 54% of new cancers occur in persons age 65 and older and that almost all Americans age 65 and older are enrolled in Medicare, that a substantial portion of the patients for whom we would expect to perform cancer diagnostic assays will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. We cannot assure you that, even if our current and our planned future assays are otherwise successful, reimbursement for the currently Medicare-covered portions of our current and our planned future assays would, without Medicare reimbursement for the enumeration portion, produce sufficient revenues to enable us to reach profitability and achieve our other commercial objectives.

Where there is a private or governmental third-party payor coverage policy in place, we bill the payor and the patient in accordance with the established policy. Where there is no coverage policy in place, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. Our efforts in obtaining reimbursement based on individual claims, including pursuing appeals or reconsiderations of claims denials, could take a substantial amount of time, and bills may not be paid for many months, if at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payor denies coverage after final appeal, payment may not be received at all. We are working to decrease risks of nonpayment by implementing a revenue cycle management system.

We cannot predict whether, or under what circumstances, payors will reimburse for all components of our assays. Payment amounts can also vary across individual policies. Full or partial denial of coverage by payors, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on our business and on market acceptance of our assays.

Legislative and Regulatory Changes Impacting Clinical Laboratory Tests

From time to time, Congress has revised the Medicare statute and the formulas it establishes for both the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, and the Physician Fee Schedule, or PFS. Annually, CMS releases the the payment amounts under the Medicare fee schedules. The rates are important because they not only determine our reimbursement under Medicare, but those payment amounts are also often used as a basis for payment amounts set by other governmental and private third -party payors. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.

In accordance with Section 1833 (h)(2)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act, the annual update to the CLFS for calendar year 2016 is 0.10% (see 42 CFR405.509(b)(1)). With respect to our diagnostic services for which we expect to be reimbursed under PFS, CMS issues a Final Rule on an annual basis. The 2014 PFS Final Rule included both increases and decreases in certain relative value units and geographic adjustment factors used to determine reimbursement for a number of codes used in our current assays and our planned future assays. These codes describe services that we must perform in connection with our assays and we bill for these codes in connection with the services that we provide. There was a significant decrease in FISH analysis under the 2015 PFS Final Rule, while the rates were increased by approximately 90% under the 2016 PFS Final Rule. 

Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which was signed to law in April 2014, there will be major changes to the payment formula under the CLFS. Beginning January 1, 2016, clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will apply to laboratory tests 

furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the hospital outpatient prospe ctive payment system. It is too early to predict the impact of this federal legislation on reimbursement for our products. 

Further, with respect to the Medicare program, Congress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance charge on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require us to bill patients for these amounts. Because of the relatively low reimbursement for many clinical laboratory tests, in the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for these services would often exceed the amount actually received from the patient and effectively increase our costs of billing and collecting.

Some of our Medicare claims may be subject to policies issued by Palmetto GBA and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, our former and current Medicare Administrative Contractor for California, respectively. Palmetto GBA, acting on behalf of many MACs, recently issued a Local Coverage Decision that affects coverage, coding and billing of many molecular diagnostic assays. Under this Local Coverage Determination, Palmetto GBA will not cover any molecular diagnostic assays, such as the enumeration component of our current assays, unless the test is expressly included in a National Coverage Determination issued by CMS or a Local Coverage Determination or coverage article issued by Palmetto GBA. Currently, laboratories may submit coverage determination requests to Palmetto GBA for consideration and apply for a unique billing code for each assay (which is a separate process from the coverage determination). In the event that a non-coverage determination is issued, the laboratory must wait six months following the determination to submit a new request. Palmetto GBA currently has a negative coverage determination for the enumeration component of CTC assays, but there is no such negative coverage determination for the analysis component of such CTC assays. Denial (or continuation of denial) of coverage for the enumeration component of our current and anticipated CTC assays by Palmetto GBA or its successor MAC, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on our business and on market acceptance of our current assays and our planned future assays. Noridian Healthcare Solutions intends to follow, for CTC assays, the positive or negative coverage determinations which from time to time Palmetto GBA makes. On November 27, 2013, Palmetto GBA denied our request for coverage for the enumeration/detection portion of our testing. We have not received any other indications to suggest that the negative coverage determination will be reversed. The CTC enumeration counts disease burden and is a prognostic test, and although valuable, it does not meet many of the medical necessity requirements of Medicare and the payors. We intend to pursue payment for the capture portion of our CTC technology that allows us to run our diagnostic testing for some of our Target-Selector assays. 

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CMS and the Office of Civil Rights issued a final rule in February 2014 to amend both the HIPAA and CLIA regulations. The final rule amended the HIPAA privacy rule to remove the CLIA laboratory exceptions, and as a result, HIPAA-covered laboratories are now required to provide individuals, upon request, with access to their completed test reports. Similarly, the final rule amended CLIA to state that CLIA laboratories and CLIA-exempt laboratories may provide copies of the patient&#8217;s completed rest reports that, using the laboratory&#8217;s authentication process, can be identified as belonging to that patient. 

Governmental Regulations

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation

As a provider of laboratory testing on human specimens for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. In 1988, Congress enacted CLIA, which established quality standards for all laboratories providing testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. Our laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of accreditation. As to state laws, we are required to meet certain laboratory licensing and other requirements. Our laboratory holds the required licenses from the applicable state agencies in which we operate. For more information on state licensing requirements, see the sections entitled see the section entitled &#8220;Governmental Regulations&#8212;California State Laboratory Licensing&#8221; and &#8220;Governmental Regulations&#8212;Other States&#8217; Laboratory Licensing.&#8221;

Under CLIA, a laboratory is defined as any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health of human beings. CLIA also requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the complexity of the categories of testing we perform and that we comply with certain standards. CLIA further regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to be reimbursed for services provided to state and federal health care program beneficiaries. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.

We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards, and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent 

requirements than laboratories performing less compl ex tests. In addition, a laboratory like ours that is certified as &#8220;high complexity&#8221; under CLIA may obtain analyte specific reagents, which are used to develop LDTs. 

In addition to CLIA requirements, we must comply with the standards set by CAP, which accredits our laboratory. Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. Therefore, because we are accredited by CAP, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. CLIA also provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and certain states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory schemes.

Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws

A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for Health and Human Services, or HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of regulatory &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; These safe harbor regulations set forth certain requirements that, if met, will assure immunity from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. For further discussion of the impact of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations on our business, see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Regulatory Risks Relating to Our Business.&#8221; We are subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.

In addition, HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs.

Finally, another development affecting the health care industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and some of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim.

Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Also, many states have laws similar to those listed above that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor.

Additionally, in Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For 

instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an u nlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. 

Physician Referral Prohibitions

Under a federal law directed at &#8220;self-referral,&#8221; commonly known as the Stark Law, there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on Medicare and Medicaid payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have a &#8220;financial relationship&#8221;&#8212;including an investment or ownership interest or a compensation arrangement&#8212;with the clinical laboratory performing the tests. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements, and (4) personal services arrangements that satisfy certain requirements. The laboratory cannot submit claims to the Medicare Part B program for services furnished in violation of the Stark Law, and Medicaid reimbursements may be at risk as well. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.

Corporate Practice of Medicine

A number of states, including California, do not allow business corporations to employ physicians to provide professional services. This prohibition against the &#8220;corporate practice of medicine&#8221; is aimed at preventing corporations such as us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians. The state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that we are engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, we could be required to restructure our contractual and other arrangements. In addition, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings, and we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could result in exclusion from state and federal health care programs.

Direct Billing Laws and Other State Law Restrictions on Billing for Laboratory Services

Laws and regulations in certain states prohibit laboratories from billing physicians or other purchasers for testing that they order. Some of those laws and regulations apply only to anatomic pathology services while others extend to other types of testing. Some states may allow laboratories to bill physicians directly but may prohibit the physician (and, in some cases, other purchasers) from charging more than the purchase price for the services (or may allow only for the recovery of acquisition costs) or may require disclosure of certain information on the invoice. In some cases, and if not prohibited by law or regulation, we may bill physicians, hospitals and other laboratories directly for the services that they order. An increase in the number of states that impose similar restrictions could adversely affect us by encouraging physicians to perform laboratory services in-house or by causing physicians to refer services to other laboratories that are not subject to the same restrictions.

Physician Licensing

A number of the states where specimens originate require that the physician interpreting those specimens be licensed by that particular state. Physicians who fail to comply with these licensure requirements could face fines or other penalties for practicing medicine without a license and we could be required to pay those fines on behalf of our pathologists or subject to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws if we bill for services furnished by unlicensed pathologists. We do not believe that the services our pathologist performs constitute the practice of medicine in any state that requires out-of-state physician licensure. We believe that our pathologist thus is not required to obtain licensure in any state where he does not reside.

In addition, many states also prohibit the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non-physician entities. We do not believe that our contractual arrangements with physicians, physicians group practices or hospitals will subject us to claims under such regulations. However, changes in the laws may necessitate modifications in our relationships with our clients.

California State Laboratory Licensing

Our laboratory is licensed and in good standing under the State of California Department of Public Health standards. Our current licenses permit us to receive specimens obtained in California.

California state laws and regulations also establish standards for the day-to-day operations of clinic al laboratories, including physical facility requirements and equipment, quality control and proficiency testing requirements. If we are found to be out of compliance with California statutory or regulatory standards, we may be subject to suspension, restr iction or revocation of our laboratory license or assessed civil money penalties. The operator of a noncompliant laboratory may also be found guilty of a misdemeanor under California law. A finding of noncompliance, therefore, may result in harm to our bus iness. 

Other States&#8217; Laboratory Licensing

Several states require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. We hold licenses from the states of Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island to test specimens from patients in those states or received from ordering physicians in those states. We are currently in the process of addressing the requirements for licensure in New York.

From time to time, other states may require out of state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from such states. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how we should comply with such requirements.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

We provide our assays as LDTs. Historically the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and has not required laboratories that offer LDTs to comply with the agency&#8217;s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of enforcement discretion and regulate certain LDTs as medical devices. To this end, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled &#8220;Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&#8221; and &#8220;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&#8221;, respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement discretion until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the draft guidance documents will be finalized, and even then, the new regulatory requirements are proposed to be phased-in consistent with the schedule set forth in the guidance (in as little as 12 months after the draft guidance is finalized for certain high-priority LDTs). Nevertheless, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. LDTs with the same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic are defined in FDA&#8217;s draft guidance as &#8220;high-risk LDTs (Class III medical devices)&#8221; for which premarket review would be first to occur.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.

Other Regulatory Requirements

Our laboratory is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.

Segment and Geographical Information

We operate in one reportable business segment and historically have derived revenues only from the United States, with international revenues of $16,027, or approximately 3% of our net revenues, commencing in 2015 and received through the twelve months ended December 31 of such year.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 53 full-time employees and one part time employee, 5 of whom hold doctorate degrees and 10 of whom are engaged in full-time research and development activities. We plan to expand production, sales and marketing and our research and development programs, and we plan to hire additional staff as these initiatives are implemented. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.
