 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Popular is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;) and subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;). Popular was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the largest financial institution based in Puerto Rico, with consolidated assets of $35.8 billion, total deposits of $27.2 billion and stockholders&#146; equity of $5.1 billion at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we ranked among the 50 largest U.S. banks based on total assets according to information gathered and disclosed by the Federal Reserve Board. 

We operate in two principal markets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Puerto Rico: We provide retail, mortgage, and commercial banking services through our principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#147;Banco Popular&#148; or &#147;BPPR&#148;), as well as auto and equipment leasing and financing, investment banking, broker-dealer and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mainland United States: We operate Banco Popular North America (&#147;BPNA&#148;), including its wholly-owned subsidiary E-LOAN, Inc. (&#147;E-LOAN&#148;). BPNA is a community bank providing a broad range of financial services and products to the communities it serves. BPNA operates branches in New York, New Jersey and Florida, under the name of Popular Community Bank (&#147;PCB&#148;). E-LOAN markets deposit accounts under its name for the benefit of BPNA. Our two reportable business segments for accounting purposes, BPPR and BPNA, correspond to our Puerto Rico and mainland United States businesses, respectively. Following the sale in the third quarter of 2010 of a 51% ownership interest and subsequent sales of shares, as discussed below, of EVERTEC, Inc. (&#147;EVERTEC&#148;), our financial transaction processing and technology services business, we report our remaining 15.54 % ownership interest in this business in our &#147;Corporate&#148; group, which also includes the holding company operations and certain other equity investments. 

The sections that follow provide a description of significant transactions that have impacted or will impact our current and future operations. 

Significant Events for 2015 

Acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC as receiver 

On February 27, 2015, BPPR, in an alliance with co-bidders, including BPNA, acquired certain assets and assumed all non-brokered deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC, as receiver (the &#147;Doral Bank Transaction&#148;). 

After taking into account the transfers to unaffiliated alliance co-bidders, BPPR and PCB assumed deposits amounting to approximately $2.2 billion and acquired commercial and residential loans amounting to approximately $1.5 billion, substantially all of which were in performing status. Additionally, the acquisition included approximately $0.6 billion in investment securities, cash and other assets. There is no loss-sharing arrangement with the FDIC on the acquired assets. 

In connection with the Doral Bank Transaction, during the second quarter of 2015, BPPR completed the acquisition of mortgage servicing rights on three pools of residential mortgage loans serviced for Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $5.0 billion, from the FDIC as receiver for Doral Bank. The aggregate purchase price for the mortgage servicing rights and related servicing advances was approximately $56 million. 

&#160;

As a result of the Doral Bank Transaction, the Corporation recorded goodwill of approximately $163 million and a core deposit intangible asset of approximately $13 million. Refer to Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for a detail of the assets and liabilities, fair value estimates and goodwill recorded in connection with the Doral Bank Transaction. 

Other assets acquired from Doral 

During 2015, the Corporation acquired the Doral Insurance Agency portfolio, as part of a separate bidding process after Doral Financial Corporation filed for bankruptcy. As a result of this acquisition, the Corporation recorded $17.3 million in customer relationship intangibles. 

The Corporation also acquired mortgage servicing rights for a portfolio previously serviced by Doral Bank, with approximately $873 million in unpaid principal balance, in connection with a pre-existing backup servicing agreement. As a result, the fair value of the Corporation&#146;s mortgage servicing rights reflected an increase of approximately $4.4 million. The Corporation also purchased the servicing advances related to this portfolio from the FDIC, as receiver of Doral Bank, for a price of $46.6 million. 

Reinstatement of quarterly cash dividend 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Corporation reinstated the quarterly cash dividend on its outstanding common stock. Cash dividends of $0.15 per share were declared during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and were subsequently paid on October 7, 2015 and January 4, 2016, respectively. This represented a quarterly cash dividend of $15.5 million for each quarter. 

Restructuring of the U.S. Operations 

The Corporation completed its centralization of certain back office operations of PCB in Puerto Rico and New York. The Corporation incurred $45.1 million in restructuring charges of which approximately $26.7 million were incurred during 2014 and $18.4 million during 2015 related to this restructuring plan. 

During 2014, the Corporation completed the sale of its California, Central Florida and Illinois regions, as part of the reorganization of its U.S. operations. The operating results from these regions have been separately presented for all periods as discontinued operations. 

Expiration of the commercial shared-loss arrangement with the FDIC 

The shared-loss arrangement under the commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC related to the loans acquired for Westernbank, in 2010 expired on June 30, 2015. Loans with a carrying amount at June 30, 2015 of approximately $248.7 million, which were reclassified to &#147;non-covered&#148; in the accompanying statement of financial condition, are subject to the resolution of several arbitration proceedings currently ongoing with the FDIC. Until the disputes are finally resolved, the terms of the commercial loss share agreement will remain in effect with respect to any such items under dispute. As of December 31, 2015, losses amounting to $149 million related to these assets are reflected in the FDIC indemnification asset as a receivable from the FDIC. Refer to additional information of these disputes on Note 30, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying financial statements. 

Partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporation recorded a partial reversal of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets from its U.S. operations for approximately $589.0 million. The Corporation concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of the total of $1.2 billion on deferred tax assets at the U.S. operations, comprised mainly of net operating losses (&#147;NOLs&#148;), will be realized. The Corporation based its determination on its estimated earnings for the remaining carryforward period &#150; eighteen years beginning with the 2016 fiscal year &#150; available to utilize the deferred tax asset to reduce its income tax obligations. 

The increase in the net deferred tax asset did not have a material impact on regulatory capital. However, it increased the tangible book value per common share by $5.68. 

&#160;

Puerto Rico Business 

General. 

We offer in Puerto Rico a variety of retail and commercial banking services through our principal bank subsidiary, BPPR. BPPR was organized in 1893 and is Puerto Rico&#146;s largest bank with consolidated total assets of $27.7 billion, deposits of $22.4 billion and stockholder&#146;s equity of $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015. BPPR accounted for 78% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2015. BPPR has the largest retail franchise in Puerto Rico, with 168 branches and 602 automated teller machines (&#147;ATMs&#148;) as of December 31, 2015. BPPR also operates eight branches in the U.S. Virgin Islands, one branch in the British Virgin Islands and one branch in New York. In the Virgin Islands, BPPR had 21 ATMs at the end of 2015. BPPR&#146;s deposits are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

Our Puerto Rico operations include those of Popular Auto, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of BPPR, a vehicle and equipment financing, leasing and daily rental company. The residential mortgages originations business is conducted by Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR. In Puerto Rico, we also offer financial advisory, investment and securities brokerage services for institutional and retail customers through our securities broker-dealer Popular Securities, LLC, (&#147;Popular Securities&#148;) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular. As of December 31, 2015, Popular Securities had $62.3 million in total assets and $3.9 billion in assets under management. In addition, BPPR has various special purpose vehicles holding specific assets acquired in satisfaction of loans for real estate development projects and commercial loans. 

We offer insurance and reinsurance services through Popular Insurance, LLC, a general insurance agency, and Popular Life RE, a reinsurance company, with total revenues of $33.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also own Popular Risk Services, LLC, an insurance broker, and Popular Insurance V.I., Inc., an insurance agency operating in the Virgin Islands. 

Lending Activities. 

Unless otherwise stated, all references in this Form 10-K to total loan portfolio, total credit exposure or loan portfolios, exclude covered loans, which represent loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction that are covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC and non-covered loans held-for-sale. Loans held-for-sale in Puerto Rico amounted to $136 million at December 31, 2015. 

We concentrate our lending activities in the following areas: 

&#160;

(1) Commercial . Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial (C&#38;I) loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations, finance, working capital needs, equipment purchases or other projects, and (ii) commercial real estate (CRE) loans (excluding construction loans) for income producing real estate properties as well as owner occupied properties. C&#38;I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and the personal guarantees of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties and real estate developers and the financing of owner-occupied facilities. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service requirements. Non-owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property. Total commercial loans in Puerto Rico were $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2015, and represented 42% of our total loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. For greater detail of the breakdown of our Commercial portfolio refer to the Table under the caption &#147;Business Concentration&#148; in this section. 

&#160;

(2) Construction . Construction loans are CRE loans to companies or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction loan portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and condominiums), office and warehouse product types. These loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. &#160;

Total construction loans in Puerto Rico were $ 101 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented less than 1% of our total loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. BPPR is currently originating a limited amount of new construction loans. 

&#160;

(3) Lease Financings . Lease financings are primarily comprised of automobile loans/leases made through automotive dealerships and equipment lease financings. Total lease financings in Puerto Rico were $ 628 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented 4% of our total loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. 

&#160;

(4) Residential Mortgage . Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans to consumers for the purchase or refinancing of a residence and also include residential construction loans made to individuals for the construction or refurbishment of their residence. The majority of these loans are financed over a 15 to 30 year amortization term, and in most cases, the loans are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. In some cases, government agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan. Our general practice is to sell a majority of our originations in the secondary mortgage market. Total mortgage loans in Puerto Rico were $ 6.1 billion as of December 31, 2015, and represented 35% of our total loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. 

&#160;

(5) Consumer . Consumer loans are mainly comprised of personal loans, credit cards, and automobile loans, and to a lesser extend home equity lines of credit (&#147;HELOCs&#148;) and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers. In this area, BPPR offers four unsecured products: personal loans, credit cards, personal credit lines and overdraft protection. All other consumer loans are secured. HELOCs include both home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower&#146;s residence, which allows customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Real estate market values as of the time HELOCs are granted directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact our exposure to losses in this type of loan. Total consumer loans in Puerto Rico were $ 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015, and represented 19 % of our total loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. 

Covered Loans. 

Loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC are referred to as &#147;covered loans&#148;. &#147;Covered&#148; foreclosed other real estate properties are also subject to loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets covered by such agreements (the &#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of qualifying recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The FDIC loss sharing agreements expired on June 30, 2015 for commercial (including construction) and consumer loans, with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years (ending on April 30, 2020). 

Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risks of the covered loans are significantly different from other loans in our portfolio, thus we have determined to segregate them in our financial statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Covered loans are reported in loans exclusive of the estimated FDIC loss share indemnification asset. 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, covered loans totaled $646 million or 2% of total consolidated assets of Popular. 

True-up payment obligation to the FDIC 

As part of the loss share agreement signed with the FDIC, BPPR agreed to make a true-up payment (the &#147;true-up payment&#148;) to the FDIC on the date that is 45 days following the last day (the &#147;true-up measurement date&#148;) of the final shared loss month, or upon the final disposition of all covered assets under the loss sharing agreements in the event losses on the loss sharing agreements fail to reach expected levels. The estimated fair value of such true-up payment obligation is recorded as contingent consideration, which is included in the caption of other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Under the loss sharing agreements, BPPR will pay to the FDIC 50% of the excess, if any, of: (i) 20% of the intrinsic loss estimate of $4.6 billion (or $925 million) (as determined by the FDIC) less (ii) the sum of: (A) 25% of the asset discount (per bid) ($1.1 billion)); plus (B) 25% of the cumulative shared loss payments (defined as the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to BPPR minus the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to the FDIC); plus (C) the sum of the period servicing amounts for every consecutive twelve month period prior to and ending on the true-up measurement date in respect of each of the loss sharing agreements during which the loss sharing provisions of the applicable loss sharing agreement is in effect (defined as the product of the simple average of the principal amount of shared loss loans and shared loss assets at the beginning and end of such period times 1%). At December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the true-up payment obligation amounted to $ 120 million. Refer to Note 14 to the accompanying financial statements. 

Mainland United States Business 

General. 

Popular North America, Inc. (&#147;PNA&#148;) functions as the holding company for our operations in the mainland United States. PNA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular, was organized in 1991 under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a registered bank holding company under the BHC Act. As of December 31, 2015, PNA had one principal subsidiary, BPNA, a full service commercial bank incorporated in the state of New York. 

The banking operations of BPNA in the United States mainland are based in three states and are conducted under the name of Popular Community Bank. As previously discussed, during 2014, the Corporation completed the sale of its California, Illinois and Central Florida operations. The following table contains information of BPNA&#146;s operations: 

&#160;

State 

&#160; Branches &#160; ATMs &#160; Aggregate Assets ($ in billions) &#160; &#160; Total Deposits ($ in billions) &#160; New York

&#160; 33 &#160; 69 &#160; $ 2.57 &#160; &#160; $ 2.61 &#160; Florida

&#160; 10 &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 0.64 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.65 &#160; New Jersey

&#160; 6 &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 0.22 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.23 &#160; In addition, BPNA owns all of the outstanding stock of E-LOAN, Popular Insurance Agency USA, and Popular Equipment Finance, Inc., which ceased originations and holds a run-off portfolio of a lease financing portfolio. E-LOAN&#146;s business currently consists solely of providing an online platform to raise deposits for BPNA. Popular Equipment Finance, Inc. sold a substantial portion of its lease financing portfolio during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and also ceased originations as part of the BPNA restructuring plan implemented in late 2008. As a result of these initiatives, the total assets of Popular Equipment Finance, Inc. were reduced to $13.9 million at December 31, 2015. Popular Insurance Agency USA, Inc. acts as an insurance agent or broker offering insurance and investment products across the BPNA branch network. Total revenues of Popular Insurance Agency USA, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.1 million. 

&#160;

Lending Activities. 

We concentrate our lending activities in the mainland U.S. in the following areas: 

&#160;

(1) Commercial . Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial (C&#38;I) loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other projects, and (ii) commercial real estate (CRE) loans (excluding construction loans) for income producing real estate properties as well as owner-occupied properties. C&#38;I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income-producing real estate properties and real estate developers and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings, healthcare facilities, multifamily buildings, and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property. Total commercial loans at BPNA were $ 2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, and represented 58% of our total loan portfolio in the U.S. 

&#160;

(2) Construction . Construction loans are CRE loans to companies or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction loan portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and condominiums), office and warehouse product types. These loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. Total construction loans at BPNA were $ 580 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented 12% of our total loan portfolio in the U.S. 

&#160;

(3) Legacy . The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at BPNA. Total legacy portfolio at BPNA was $ 64 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented 1% of our total loan portfolio in the U.S. 

&#160;

(4) Mortgage . Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans to consumers for the purchase or refinancing of a residence and also include residential construction loans made to individuals for the construction or refurbishment of their residence. The majority of these loans are financed over a 15 to 30 year amortization term, and in most cases, the loans are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. In some cases, government agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan. Our general practice is to sell a significant majority of our fixed-rate originations in the secondary market. In response to economic conditions, we exited the origination of non-conventional mortgage loans in the U.S. mainland during 2008. 

Total mortgage loans at BPNA were $ 909 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented 19% of our total loan portfolio in the U.S. 

&#160;

(5) Consumer . Consumer loans include personal loans, credit cards, auto loans, HELOCs and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers. In this area, BPNA offers four unsecured products: personal loans, credit cards, personal credit lines and overdraft protection. All other consumer loans are secured. As a result of our restructuring of the E-LOAN operations in prior years, consumer loans continue to decrease as the remaining closed-end second mortgages and HELOCs originated through the E-LOAN platform continue to be paid down or refinanced, in addition to a reduction in the loan origination activity since E-LOAN no longer operates as a direct lender. 

&#160;

Total consumer loans at BPNA were $491 million as of December 31, 2015, and represented 10 % of our total loan portfolio in the U.S. 

Credit Administration and Credit Policies 

Interest from our loan portfolios is our principal source of revenue. Whenever we make loans, we expose ourselves to credit risk. At December 31, 2015, our credit exposure was centered in our $ 22.3 billion non-covered loan portfolio which represented 72% of our earning assets excluding covered loans. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through active asset quality management, including the use of lending standards, thorough review of potential borrowers and active asset quality administration. 

Business activities that expose us to credit risk are managed within the Board of Director&#146;s Risk Management policy, and the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy which establishes limits that consider factors such as maintaining a prudent balance of risk-taking across diversified risk types and business units, compliance with regulatory guidance, controlling the exposure to lower credit quality assets, and limiting growth in, and overall exposure to, any product or risk segment where we do not have sufficient experience and a proven ability to predict credit losses. 

Our Credit Strategy Committee (&#147;CRESCO&#148;) is management&#146;s top policy-making body with respect to credit-related matters and credit strategies. CRESCO reviews the activities of each subsidiary to ensure a proactive and coordinated management of credit granting, credit exposures and credit procedures. CRESCO&#146;s principal functions include reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and periodically approving appropriate provisions, monitoring compliance with charge-off policy, establishing portfolio diversification, yield and quality standards, establishing credit exposure reporting standards, monitoring asset quality, and approving credit policies and amendments thereto for the subsidiaries and/or business lines, including special lending approval authorities when and if appropriate. The analysis of the allowance adequacy is presented to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors for review, consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis. 

We also have a Corporate Credit Risk Management Division (&#147;CCRMD&#148;). The CCRMD is a centralized unit, independent of the lending function. The CCRMD&#146;s functions include identifying, measuring and controlling credit risk independently from the business units, evaluating the credit risk rating system and reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and regulatory standards. The CCRMD also ensures that the subsidiaries comply with the credit policies and applicable regulations, and monitors credit underwriting standards. Also, the CCRMD performs ongoing monitoring of the portfolio, including potential areas of concern for specific borrowers and/or geographic regions. 

Effective in April 2015, the Corporate Loan Review Unit was separated from the CCRMD, and incorporated into a new division named Corporate Loan Review and Model Risk Monitoring (&#147;CLR &#38; MRM&#147;). Through the Commercial Loan Review Unit at the Corporate Loan Review Department (&#147;CLRD&#148;), CLR &#38; MRM evaluates compliance with the Bank&#146;s Commercial Credit Norms and Procedures and the precision of risk rating accuracy. The CLRD performs annual credit process reviews of several commercial portfolios, including small and middle market, construction, asset-based and corporate banking lending groups in BPPR, as well as BPNA&#146;s commercial and construction portfolios. This group evaluates the credit risk profile of each originating unit along with each unit&#146;s credit administration effectiveness, including the assessment of the risk rating representative of the current credit quality of the loans, and the evaluation of credit and collateral documentation. The monitoring performed by CLRD contributes to assess compliance with credit policies and underwriting standards, to determine the current level of credit risk, to evaluate the effectiveness of the credit management process and to identify control deficiencies that may arise in the credit-origination and management processes. Based on its findings, CLRD develops recommendations to implement corrective actions, if necessary, that help in maintaining a sound credit process and that credit risk is kept at an acceptable level. 

&#160;

We maintain comprehensive credit policies for all lines of business in order to mitigate credit risk. Our credit policies are ratified by our Board of Directors and set forth, among other things, underwriting standards and procedures for monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality. Our credit policies also require prompt identification and quantification of asset quality deterioration or potential loss in order to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Included in these policies, primarily determined by the amount, type of loan and risk characteristics of the credit facility, are various approval levels and lending limit constraints, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized. 

Our credit policies and procedures establish strict documentation requirements for each loan and related collateral type, when applicable, during the underwriting, closing and monitoring phases. During the initial loan underwriting process, the credit policies require, at a minimum, historical financial statements or tax returns of the borrower and any guarantor, an analysis of financial information contained in a credit approval package, a risk rating determination in the case of commercial and construction loans, reports from credit agencies and appraisals for real estate-related loans. We currently do not make &#147;no doc&#148; or &#147;stated income&#148; loans where there is no income or asset verification by the lender. The credit policies also set forth the required closing documentation depending on the loan and the collateral type. 

Although we originate most of our loans internally in both the Puerto Rico and mainland United States markets, we occasionally purchase or participate in loans originated by other financial institutions. When we purchase or participate in loans originated by others, we conduct the same underwriting analysis of the borrowers and apply the same criteria as we do for loans originated by us. This also includes a review of the applicable legal documentation. 

Set forth below are the general parameters under which we analyze our major loan categories: 

Commercial and Construction : Commercial and construction loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower&#146;s operations, including the borrower&#146;s business model, management, financial statements, pro-forma financial condition including financial projections, use of funds, debt service capacity, leverage and the financial strength of any guarantor. Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our loan-to value limitations are, in certain cases, determined by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. Non-recourse lending is limited to borrowers with very solid financial capacity. 

As of December 31, 2015, $ 4.8 billion, or 64%, of our commercial and construction loans in Puerto Rico were secured by real estate, while in the mainland United States these figures totaled $ 2.4 billion, or 74%, respectively. 

Consumer, Mortgage and Lease Financings: Our consumer, mortgage and lease financings are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also include an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition, including verification of income, assets and Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score. Credit reports are obtained and reconciled with the financial statements provided to us. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans does not exist, for risk assessment purposes, subprime consumer and mortgage loans in the BPPR segment are determined based on the final rule definition of higher risk consumer loans issued by the FDIC which was made effective during 2013. A higher-risk consumer loan is defined as a loan where, as of origination, or as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years is greater than 20%. In Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2015, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $189.3 million (6% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio) and $699.0 million (11% of the Puerto Rico mortgage loan portfolio), respectively. Since the final rule definition is not applicable to our U.S. operation, subprime loans in the BPNA segment are defined as borrowers with one or a combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO credit scores (generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such as defaults and limited credit history. As of December 31, 2015, our mainland United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $77.9 million (or 16% of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and $337.5 million (or 37% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans portfolio). As part of the restructuring in 2008 of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued 

&#160;

originating loans with subprime characteristics in those operations, including the U.S. non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio and E-LOAN. Popular does not target subprime borrowers and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. 

As of December 31, 2015, there was a nominal amount of interest-only loans in our consumer loans portfolio and $78.9 million of interest-only loans in our mortgage loan portfolio, all of which were at BPPR. Also, we did not have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgage loans in our Puerto Rico portfolio, except for a special step loan mortgage product to purchasers of units within construction projects financed by BPPR. This product, with a term of up to 40 years, provides for 100% financing at a 2.99% interest rate for the first five years of the term of the loan and 5.88% fixed-rate for the remaining term. Consistent with our credit policies, the underwriting and loan approval process for our step loan mortgage product is based on a number of factors, including an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition (including verification of income, assets and FICO credit score), as well as debt-to-equity ratio, reserves, loan-to-value and prior mortgage experience. While Popular has not established specific limits for FICO credit scores, debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-values applicable to this product, the underwriting parameters applied to this product are generally similar to the standards used for the underwriting of our non-conforming loans, except for higher loan-to-value ratios (90% or higher). As of December 31, 2015, Popular had $377.9 million of these step loans. 

As of December 31, 2015, $6.1 billion, or 65 %, of our total consumer loans, including mortgage loans, in Puerto Rico were secured by real estate. In the United States mainland, these figures totaled $ 1.2 billion, or 71 %, respectively. Lease financings are also secured by the underlying asset. 

Loan extensions, renewals and restructurings 

Loans with satisfactory credit profiles can be extended, renewed or restructured. Many commercial loan facilities are structured as lines of credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business needs, use of funds, timing of completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and are not considered concessions, and the loans continue to be recorded as performing. 

We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for example: (i) the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification; (ii) the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii) there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv) currently, the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v) based on estimates and projections that only encompass the current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. 

We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past due 90 days and over, borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In commercial and construction loans, certain exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i) when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed, and not as a result of payment or credit issues; (ii) to improve our collateral position or otherwise maximize recovery or mitigate potential future losses; and (iii) with respect to certain entities that, although related through common ownership, are not cross defaulted nor cross-collateralized and are performing satisfactorily under their respective loan facilities. Such advances are underwritten following our credit policy guidelines and approved up to prescribed policy limits, which are dependent on the borrower&#146;s financial condition, collateral and guarantee, among others. 

&#160;

In addition to the legal lending limit established under applicable state banking law, discussed in detail below, business activities that expose the Corporation to credit risk should be managed within guidelines described in the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy. Limits are defined for loss and credit performance metrics, portfolio composition and concentration, and industry and name-level, which monitors lending concentration to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers, including specific lending limits based on industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the banks&#146; capital. 

Loans to borrowers with financial difficulties can be modified as a loss mitigation alternative. New terms and conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is established where the borrower has to comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the new terms before implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial difficulties and the terms reflect concessions that would not otherwise be granted are considered as Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. These concessions stem from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. TDRs also include loans for which the Corporation has entered into liquidation proceedings with borrowers in which neither principal or interest is forgiven, but the Corporation accepts payments which are different than the contractual payment schedule. Refer to additional information on TDRs on Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Loans classified as TDRs are reported in non-accrual status if the loan was in non-accruing status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan will continue in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at least six months of sustained performance after classified as TDR and management has concluded whether it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in a foreseeable future). If the loan was appropriately on accrual status prior to the restructuring, the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms (for a period of at least six months, as defined), and the bank&#146;s credit evaluation shows the borrower&#146;s capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms (both principal and interest payments), it is likely that the appropriate conclusion is for the loan to remain on accrual at the time of the restructuring. Loans classified as TDRs are excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms exists for a reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance after being classified) and the loan yields a market rate. 

Business Concentration 

Since our business activities are currently concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base. Our asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in &#147;Financial Information about Geographic Areas&#148; below and in Note 44, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report. 

Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. However, approximately 65% of our non-covered loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 consisted of real estate-related loans, including residential mortgage loans, construction loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. The table below presents the distribution of our non-covered loan portfolio by loan category at December 31, 2015. &#147;Legacy&#148; refers to loans remaining from lines of businesses we exited as a result of the restructuring of our U.S. operations in 2008 and 2009.

Except for the Corporation&#146;s exposure to the Puerto Rico Government sector, no individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to our total assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation&#146;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities amounted to $669 million, of which approximately $578 million is outstanding. Of the amount outstanding, $502 million consists of loans and $76 million are securities. Obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico and public corporations that are either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment amounted to $19 million of securities and $57 million of loans at December 31, 2015. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as public utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. Obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment, amounted to $57 million of securities and $445 million in loans at December 31, 2015. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. These loans have seniority to the payment of operating cost and expenses of the municipality. If the Government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities are unable to manage their fiscal crisis, the value of these obligations could be adversely affected, resulting in losses to us. Note 30 to the consolidated financial statements details the loan and investments representing the Corporation&#146;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities according to their maturities. 

In addition, at December 31, 2015, the Corporation had $394 million in indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by non-governmental entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. These included $316 million in residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had $50 million in Puerto Rico pass-through housing bonds backed by FNMA, GNMA or residential loans CMO&#146;s, and $28 million of industrial development notes. 

The Government of Puerto Rico is experiencing a severe fiscal crisis, which has adversely impacted the loans and securities described above and can result in further losses. For further discussion of our loan portfolio and geographical concentration, including the Government of Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal crisis, see &#147;Financial Condition &#151; Loans&#148; and &#147;Credit Risk Management and Loan Quality-Geographical and Government Risk&#148; in the &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section of the Annual Report. 

Competition 

The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the banking business is highly competitive with respect to originating loans, acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our products and services comes from commercial banks. The principal competitors for BPPR include locally based commercial banks and a few large U.S. and foreign banks with assets up to approximately $10 billion as of December 31, 2015. On April 30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and entered into loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three other commercial banks with operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to Westernbank Puerto Rico. Those transactions involved the acquisition of most of the assets and liabilities of the closed banks, including the assumption of all of the non-brokered deposits. On December 18, 2012, there was another banking consolidation in Puerto Rico when Oriental Financial Group, a locally based financial institution, acquired the Puerto Rico operations of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (BBVA), a foreign bank. On February 27, 2015, the Puerto Rico banking industry further consolidated as a result of another FDIC-assisted transaction in which BPPR, in an alliance with co-bidders, including BPNA, acquired certain assets and all deposits, except for certain non-brokered deposits, under receivership of Doral Bank. While these transactions have reduced the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico, they have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. As of December 31, 2015, there were 8 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico. 

We also compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage houses, mortgage 

&#160;

companies, insurance companies, credit unions (locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic consumer financial services. These competitors collectively represent a significant portion of the market and have lower cost structure and fewer regulatory constraints. 

In the United States we continue to face substantial competitive pressure as our footprint resides in two large, metropolitan markets of New York City / Northern New Jersey and the greater Miami area. There is a large number of Community and Regional banks along with national banking institutions present in both markets, many of which have a larger amount of resources than us. 

In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business include pricing, convenience of branch locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. 

Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and to sufficiently improve our services and/or banking products, in order to successfully compete in our primary service areas. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 7,810 full time equivalent employees, of which 7,162 were located in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and 648 in the U.S. mainland. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. 

Financial Information About Segments 

Our corporate structure consists of two reportable segments &#151; BPPR and BPNA. A &#147;Corporate&#148; group has been defined to support the reportable segments. On September 30, 2010, the Corporation completed the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC, which included the merchant acquiring business of BPPR. During the year 2013, the Corporation sold additional shares in connection with EVERTEC&#146;s public offerings. Revenue from the remaining 15.54 % ownership interest in EVERTEC is reported as non-interest income in the Corporate group. 

Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the organizational structure, which focuses primarily on the markets the segments serve, as well as on the products and services offered by the segments. 

For further information about our segments, see &#147;Reportable Segment Results&#148; in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report and Note 44, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report.

&#160; Regulation and Supervision 

Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Popular, PNA and their respective subsidiaries. Such laws and regulations are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Any change in the laws and regulations applicable to Popular and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of Popular and its subsidiaries. 

General 

Popular and PNA are bank holding companies subject to consolidated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. BPPR and BPNA are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of BPPR, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), and in the case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Department of Financial Services. 

On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act, which we refer to as the &#147;Proposed SIFI Rules&#148;, establishing enhanced prudential standards for 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Stress testing of capital; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Liquidity requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Overall risk management requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Resolution plan (so-called &#147;living wills&#148;) and credit exposure reporting; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Concentration/credit exposure limits. The recent financial crisis led to the adoption and revision of numerous laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions operating in the U.S. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, and the rules that followed have significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the U.S. Not all the rules required or expected to be implemented under 

&#160;

the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted or even proposed, certain of the rules that have been adopted or proposed under the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods, and many of the rules that have been adopted are subject to interpretation or clarification. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses continue to depend to a large extend on the implementation of the legislation by the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies as well as how market practices and structures change in response to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. We will continue to assess our businesses and risk management and compliance practices to conform to developments in the regulatory environment. 

In October 2012, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board published final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The rules require institutions, such as Popular and BPPR, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. Implementation of the rules for covered institutions with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion began in 2013. Beginning with the 2016 stress test, the company-run stress tests are conducted using data as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year and scenarios released by the agencies. Stress test results must be reported to the agencies by July 31st with public disclosure of summary stress test results under the severely adverse scenario between October 15th and October 31st. Our capital ratios reflected in the stress test calculations are an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve Board in evaluating the capital adequacy of Popular and its subsidiaries and whether the appropriateness of any proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

In February 2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules that were required to be established under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (&#147;Final SIFI Rules&#148;) strengthening supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. The Final SIFI Rules established a number of enhanced prudential standards for large U.S. bank holding companies to help increase the resiliency of their operations. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. For U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, the Final SIFI Rules incorporate previously issued capital planning and stress testing requirements as an enhanced prudential standard. The Final SIFI Rules also require U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to comply with enhanced risk-management and liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs during a 30-day stress event. In addition, the Final SIFI Rules require publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. Popular has a Risk Management committee and is in compliance with this requirement. 

As of December 31, 2015, Popular had total consolidated assets of $35.8 billion. As of the same date, BPPR and BPNA had total consolidated assets of $27.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;, &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. A depository institution&#146;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio (a new ratio requirement under the Basel III Capital Rules), the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. 

An insured depository institution will be deemed to be (i) &#147;well capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#147;well capitalized&#148;; (iii) &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if the institution&#146;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured 

&#160;

depository institution&#146;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the institution&#146;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be &#147;undercapitalized&#148;. &#147;Undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 

&#147;Significantly undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#147;Critically undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the FDIC-insured depository institutions such as BPPR and BPNA, but they are not directly applicable to holding companies such as Popular and PNA, which control such institutions. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

BPPR and BPNA are subject to restrictions under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act that limit the amount of extensions of credit and certain other &#147;covered transactions&#148; (as defined in Section 23A) between BPPR or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other, and that impose collateralization requirements on such credit extensions. A bank may not engage in any covered transaction if the aggregate amount of the bank&#146;s covered transactions with that affiliate would exceed 10% of the bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus or the aggregate amount of the bank&#146;s covered transactions with all affiliates would exceed 20% of the bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus. In addition, Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that any transaction between BPPR or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis. 

Source of Financial Strength 

The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s policy has historically required bank holding companies, such as Popular and PNA to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, Popular and PNA are expected to commit resources to support their subsidiary banks, including at times when Popular and PNA may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. BPPR and BPNA are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. 

&#147;Living Will&#148; 

As required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have jointly issued a final rule, which became effective on November 1, 2011, that requires certain organizations, including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, to report periodically to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board such company&#146;s plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. The final rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan&#146;s components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution and a description of the company&#146;s organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. 

In addition, the FDIC has issued a final rule, which became effective on April 1, 2012, that requires insured depository institutions with total assets of $50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institution&#146;s failure. The rule requires these institutions to submit a resolution plan that will enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution&#146;s failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than a Friday), maximizes the net-present-value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution&#146;s creditors. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Popular, BPPR and BPNA&#146;s total assets were below the thresholds for applicability of these rules. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The principal sources of funding for the holding companies have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. Various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#147;NYSDFS&#148;). BPNA paid a dividend of $200 million in December 2015 after receiving the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December 31, 2015, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately $525 million. 

On October 20, 2014, the Memorandum of Understanding (the &#147;FRB-NY MOU&#148;) entered into on July 20, 2011 among Popular, BPPR, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#148;FRB-NY&#148;) and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico was terminated. The FRB-NY MOU provided, among other things, for the Corporation to take steps to improve its credit risk management practices and asset quality, and for the Corporation to develop strategic plans to improve earnings and to develop capital plans. The FRB-NY MOU also required the Corporation to obtain approval from the applicable FRB-NY MOU counterparties prior to, among other things, declaring or paying dividends, purchasing or redeeming any shares of its stock, consummating acquisitions or mergers, or making any distributions on its trust preferred securities or subordinated debentures. On January 9, 2015, another Memorandum of Understanding entered into in July 2011 among BPNA, the FRB-NY and the NYSDFS, was also terminated. This Memorandum of Understanding provided that BPNA could not declare dividends without the approval of the FRB-NY and the NYSDFS. 

It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#146;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding company&#146;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that in evaluating the capital plans submitted by bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. For further information please refer to Part II, Item 5, &#147;Market for Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148;. 

Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30% applied to other &#147;foreign&#148; corporations. 

See &#147;Puerto Rico Regulation&#151;General&#148; below for a description of certain restrictions on BPPR&#146;s ability to pay dividends under Puerto Rico law. 

FDIC Insurance 

BPPR and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#147;Reform Act&#148;) created a single DIF, increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and provided for possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts. Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based assessment system so that effective January 1, 2007, the FDIC imposed insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. 

&#160;

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;) temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. Section 335 of the Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 standard maximum limit for federal deposit insurance. 

Section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the ceiling on the size of the DIF (1.5 percent of estimated insured deposits prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act). Section 334 also raised the statutorily required floor for the DIF from 1.15 % of estimated insured deposits to 1.35 % of estimated insured deposits, or a comparable percentage of the revised assessment base required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which is based on average total assets less average tangible equity. Section 334 required the FDIC to take the steps necessary for the DIF to meet this revised reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. 

On October 19, 2010, the FDIC adopted a new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Restoration Plan (the &#147;Restoration Plan&#148;) for the DIF to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by Section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Restoration Plan, the FDIC has foregone the uniform three-basis point increase in initial assessment rates previously scheduled to take place on January 1, 2011. On December 14, 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule, which became effective on January 1, 2011, to set the DIF&#146;s designated reserve ratio at 2% of estimated insured deposits. 

As required by Sections 331 and 332 of the Dodd-Frank Act, on February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule relating to deposit insurance assessment base, assessment rate adjustments, deposit insurance assessment rates, dividends, and large bank pricing methodology, which became effective on April 1, 2011.This final rule outlined significant changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assets and created a &#147;Scorecard&#148; system. The &#147;Scorecard&#148; system uses a performance score and loss of severity score, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate. Under this final rule, the assessment base for an insured depository institution also changed to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. Prior to April 1, 2011, only deposits payable in the United States were included in determining the premium paid by an institution. 

In October 2015, the FDIC proposed to impose a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. This would result in increased costs for BPPR. Because of the uncertainty as to the outcome of the FDIC&#146;s proposals, we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate impact of any surcharges on the amount of deposit insurance expense reported in the future periods. 

The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The FICO assessment rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 0.580 basis points of the assessment base. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a DIF average total asset less average tangible equity assessment base of approximately $31 billion. 

Brokered Deposits 

The FDIA governs the receipt of brokered deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and the regulations adopted thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for institutions that are less than well capitalized. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. Popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and BPNA. 

Capital Adequacy 

Popular, BPPR and BPNA are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to Popular, BPPR and BPNA, parts of which are currently in the process of being phased-in, are based on the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;). Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital standards applicable to Popular, BPPR and BPNA (the &#147;general risk-based capital rules&#148;) were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, of the Basel Committee. On July 2, 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules (the &#147;Basel III Capital Rules&#148;) implementing the Basel III framework as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The Federal Reserve Board approved the Basel III Capital Rules to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. banking organization. In July 9, 2013 the Basel III Capital Rules were approved by the OCC and (as interim final rules) by the FDIC. 

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee&#146;s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#147;Basel III&#148; for strengthening international capital standards. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including Popular, BPPR and BPNA, as compared to the prior U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios and replace the prior general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#146;s 1988 &#147;Basel I&#148; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#147;standardized approach&#148; in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal agencies&#146; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for Popular, BPPR and BPNA on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. 

Among other matters, the Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#147;Common Equity Tier 1&#148; (&#147;CET1&#148;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including the Corporation, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules&#146; specific requirements. 

Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios that became effective on January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;). The Basel III Capital Rules also introduce a new &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148;, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, Popular, BPPR and BPNA will be required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

In addition, under the prior general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#147;AOCI&#148;) items included in shareholders&#146; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Popular, BPPR and BPNA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Popular, BPPR and BPNA have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio. 

Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;Collins Amendment&#148;) required the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions and their holding companies. In effect, the Collins Amendment applied to bank holding companies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment excluded trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, 

&#160;

subject to phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January 1, 2013 and to be implemented &#147;incrementally&#148; over a three-year period commencing on that date. Consistent with the Collins Amendment, the Basel III Capital Rules preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies&#146; Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out in the case of bank holding companies that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. The Corporation has $ 427 million of trust preferred securities that are subject to the phase-out provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules. Trust preferred securities no longer included in Popular&#146;s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of Tier 2 capital set forth in the Basel III Capital Rules. Popular has not issued any trust preferred securities since May 19, 2010. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

With respect to BPPR and BPNA, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; (&#147;PCA&#148;) regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the prior 6%); and (iii) eliminating the prior provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject Popular and its depository institution subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to certain restrictions on our business. See &#147;&#150; Prompt Corrective Action&#148;. 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the prior four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

Refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 27 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; and Table 16 of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis for the capital ratios of Popular, BPPR and BPNA under Basel III. 

Interstate Branching 

Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#147;Interstate Banking Act&#148;) to authorize national banks and state banks to branch interstate through de novo branches. This section became effective on July 22, 2010. Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Interstate Banking Act provided that states may make an &#147;opt-in&#148; election to permit interstate branching through de novo branches. A majority of states did not opt in. Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated such required &#147;opt-in&#148; election. For purposes of the Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as are other state banks. 

Activities and Acquisitions 

Under the BHC Act, the activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries have been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the United States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in non-banking activities, unless such activities were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking financial activities than is permissible for bank holding companies that fail to meet those standards, including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies. In order for a bank holding company 

&#160;

to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i) all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized (as described above), and well managed and (ii) it must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; In addition, Section 606 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that a bank holding company that is a financial holding company and therefore may engage in the expanded financial activities authorized by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act be and remain well-capitalized and well managed. Popular and PNA have elected to be treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating for the management component of the composite rating. If, after becoming a financial holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the capital or managerial requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter into a confidential agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may extend the agreement or may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue, or divest investments in companies engaged in, activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 

The so-called &#147;Volcker Rule&#148; issued under the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective in July 2015, restricts the ability of Popular and its subsidiaries, including BPPR and BPNA, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. Popular and its subsidiaries generally do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our operations. Development and monitoring of the required compliance program, however, may require the expenditure of significant resources and management attention. 

The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to limit and may in certain circumstances limit our ability to conduct activities and make acquisitions that would otherwise be permissible for a financial holding company. In addition, we are required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the United States and abroad. 

Pursuant to Section 163 of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets greater than $50 billion (regardless of whether such bank holding companies have elected to be treated as financial holding companies) must provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring shares of certain financial companies with assets in excess of $10 billion, unless an exception applies. In addition, Section 604 of the Dodd-Frank Act, added a new application requirement before a financial holding company (regardless of its size) may acquire a nonbank company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2015, Popular had total consolidated assets of $35.8 billion. 

Anti-Money Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act 

A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;) strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act imposed significant compliance and due diligence obligations, created new crimes and penalties and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities, including extending credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and geographies. Should Popular or our bank subsidiaries fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.

Section 1075(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for electronic debit transactions, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on October 1, 2011. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per 

&#160;

transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Also on June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the interim final rule. The interim final rule regarding fraud-prevention adjustment also became effective on October 1, 2011. 

Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 

Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, also known as the &#147;Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010&#148; or &#147;CFPA,&#148; created a new consumer financial services regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, commonly called the &#147;CFPB&#148;, which has assumed most of the consumer financial services regulatory responsibilities currently exercised by federal banking regulators and other agencies. The CFPB&#146;s primary functions include the supervision of &#147;covered persons&#148; (broadly defined to include any person offering or providing a consumer financial product or service and any affiliated service provider) for compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB also has the broad power to prescribe rules applicable to a covered person or service provider identifying as unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. We are subject to examination and regulation by the CFPB. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government of the sanctioned country or other specially designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons outside of the United States). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Cybersecurity 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cyber security. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#146;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#146;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 

In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date we have not experienced a significant security breach of our systems, a significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cyber security attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. 

Incentive Compensation 

The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Popular, that are not &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive 

&#160;

compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

In April 2011, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as Popular, PNA, BPPR and BPNA. The proposed rule (i) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation (based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the FDIA) and (ii) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements for executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution. The proposed rule requires covered institutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices. The comment period ended in May 2011. Although final rules have not been adopted as of February 2016, officials from the Federal Reserve Board have recently indicated that the U.S. banking regulators are in the process of preparing for public comment a new rule on incentive compensation. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives. 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146; policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of Popular and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees. 

Puerto Rico Regulation 

As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, BPPR is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;). 

Section 27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net income of BPPR be credited annually to a reserve fund. The apportionment must be done every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. During 2015, $ 26.3 million was transferred to the statutory reserve account. During 2015, BPPR was in compliance with the statutory reserve requirement. 

Section 27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital. 

Section 16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of Section 16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November 24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law. 

&#160;

Section 17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December 31, 2015, the legal lending limit for BPPR under this provision was approximately $269 million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section 17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of Puerto Rico. 

Section 14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and originating and servicing mortgage loans. BPPR engages in finance leasing through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Popular Auto, LLC, which is organized and operates in Puerto Rico. The origination and servicing of mortgage loans is conducted by Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR.
