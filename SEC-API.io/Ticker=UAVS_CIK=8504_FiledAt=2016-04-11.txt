Company History 

&#160;

We were formerly known as Millennium Plastics Corporation and were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 31, 1999. We abandoned a prior business plan focusing on the development of biodegradable plastic materials. In August 2006, we acquired Midwest Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to a reverse merger. After the merger, Midwest Energy became a wholly-owned subsidiary, and as a result of the merger the former Midwest Energy stockholders controlled approximately 98% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We changed our name to EnerJex Resources, Inc. in connection with the merger, and in November 2007 we changed the name of Midwest Energy (now our wholly-owned subsidiary) to EnerJex Kansas, Inc. All of our current operations are conducted through EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC, and Black Raven Energy, Inc., and our leasehold interests are held in our wholly-owned subsidiaries Black Sable Energy, LLC, Working Interest, LLC, EnerJex Kansas, Inc., and Black Raven Energy, Inc.

Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

&#160;

As discussed under &#8220;Item 9B &#8212; Other Information&#8221; the continued low oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and into 2016 have had a significant adverse impact on our business, and, as a result of our financial condition, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

&#160;

On April 1, 2016 we ceased making mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments on our credit facility. After discussions with our bank, we made our mandatory quarterly interest payment on April 6, 2016 and on April 7, 2016 entered into a Forbearance Agreement (dated as of April 4, 2016), whereby the bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under credit facility for thirty days. We are using this 30-day to pursue strategic alternatives

&#160;

Please read &#8220;Item 9B &#8212; Other Information&#8221; for further discussion. Also, for additional discussion of factors that may affect our ability to continue as a going concern and the potential consequences of our failure to do so, please see &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160;

Significant Developments in 2015 

&#160;

The following briefly describes our most significant corporate developments occurring in 2015:

&#160;

On March 13, 2015, the Company issued in a registered offering 763,547 registered shares of its common stock together with 1,242.17099 shares of its newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;) convertible into 709,812 shares of common stock. We also issued in an unregistered offering, 521.62076 shares of Preferred Stock convertible into 298,069 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase 1,771,428 shares of its common stock. The shareholder&#8217;s ability to convert a portion of the Preferred Stock and to exercise the warrant are restricted: (i) prior to the Company obtaining approval of the offering by its shareholders, which we expect to obtain before May 31, 2015, and (ii) pursuant to customary &#8220;blocker&#8221; provisions restricting the investor&#8217;s ownership to 9.99% of our outstanding common stock.

&#160;

The Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and will be convertible at the option of the shareholder at a conversion ratio equal to approximately 571 shares of common stock for each one (1) share of Preferred Stock, subject to customary adjustments and anti-dilution price protection. Dividends are payable on the shares of Preferred Stock only if and to the extent that dividends are payable on the common stock into which the Preferred Stock is convertible. The Preferred Stock has no maturity date and can be redeemed by the Company beginning twelve months after the closing of the offering or upon a change of control. Each warrant will be exercisable for one share of common stock, for a period of five years beginning nine months after March 13, 2015, at a cash exercise price of $2.75 per share, and may be exercised on a cashless basis after that nine-month period if no effective registration statement covers the warrant shares by that time.

&#160;

On May 13, 2015, the Company sold 183,433 shares of its 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock at $12.50 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $2.3 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, preferred stock dividends, and repayment of outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility.

&#160;

The offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-199030) previously filed and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

&#160;

On July 21, 2015, the Company received a liquidating distribution from Oakridge Energy Inc. in the amount of $1,450,695 with respect to shares of Oakridge that are owned by the Company. The Company repaid $750,000 of long term debt. The remaining amount will be reinvested in Company projects. The liquidating distribution was funded from the proceeds of Oakridge&#8217;s sale of its La Plate County, Colorado property. The distribution is reflected in the September 30, 2015 Consolidated Balance sheet as part of accounts receivable.

&#160;

On August 12, 2015, we entered into a Tenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tenth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) allow the Company to sell certain oil assets in Kansas, (ii) allow for approximately $1,300,000 of the proceeds from the sale to be reinvested in Company owned oil and gas projects and (iii) apply not less than $1,500,000 from the proceed of the sale to outstanding loan balances.

&#160;

On August 12, 2015, EnerJex Resources, Inc., through its subsidiaries, EnerJex Kansas, Inc., and Working Interest, LLC, sold various oil and gas leases, equipment and wells in Kansas for approximately $2.8 million to Haas Petroleum, LLC, BAM Petroleum, LLC and MorMeg, LLC. The effective date of the sale was July 1, 2015.

&#160;

On November 4, 2015 the Company suspended the monthly dividend for the month of November 2015 on its 10.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) in order to preserve its cash resources. Payment of future dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be determined by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.

&#160;

Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, the dividend for the month of November 2015, and any future unpaid dividends, will accumulate. If the Company does not pay dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock for six monthly periods (whether consecutive or non-consecutive), the dividend rate will increase to 12.0% per annum and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have the right, at the next meeting of stockholders, to elect two directors to serve on the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors along with other members of the Board, until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends are paid in full.

&#160;

On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Eleventh Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Eleventh Amendment&#8221;). The Eleventh Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) waived certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, (ii) suspend certain hedging requirements, and (iii) to make certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

Our principal strategy is to acquire, develop, explore and produce domestic onshore oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are currently focused in Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas.

&#160;

Our total net proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 were 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalents (BOE), of which 59.4% was oil. Of the 2.6 million BOE of total proved reserves, approximately 39.0% are classified as proved developed producing, approximately 32.9% are classified as proved developed non-producing, and approximately 28.1% are classified as proved undeveloped.

&#160;

The total PV10 (present value) of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $8.8 million. &#8220;PV10&#8221; means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development and abandonment costs after giving consideration of salvage value there were no material abandonment costs included in future development costs, using prices and costs in effect at the determination date, before income taxes, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses, discounted to a present value using an annual discount rate of 10% in accordance with the guidelines of the SEC. PV10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reserves&#8221; page 36, for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.

&#160;

Except where noted, the discussion regarding our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

Adena Field Project 

&#160;

The Adena Field Project is located in the Denver-Julesburg (&#8220;D-J&#8221;) Basin in Morgan County, Colorado, where we owned a 100% working interest in 18,280 gross acres as of December 31, 2015. Our acreage position covers the majority of Adena Field, which is the third largest oil field ever discovered in Colorado behind Rangely Field and Wattenberg Field. Adena Field has cumulatively produced 75 million barrels of oil and 125 billion cubic feet of natural gas since its discovery in the early 1950s. Our acreage in this project is currently held-by-production (see &#8220;Glossary&#8221; on page 15 for definition of held-by-production). The majority of the producing wells in Adena Field were temporarily abandoned or shut-in during the mid-1980&#8217;s when oil prices collapsed, and a relatively small number of wells have been produced since that time.

&#160;

Approximately 111 wells on our acreage are currently shut-in or temporarily abandoned. Our current understanding of the field indicates that most of the remaining 97 shut-in oil wells are candidates for reactivation, recompletion or use in a larger scale EOR project. The same is true for the remaining 14 shut-in injection wells. We have a significant EOR project study under way at the present time and have begun field sampling and EOR flood modeling for each project. We intend to reactivate vintage secondary recovery injection wells simultaneously with the reactivation and/or recompletion of producer wells. Recompletions and reactivations are expected to cost approximately $200,000 to $250,000 per well and are expected to result in stabilized production rates of approximately 10 barrels of oil per day. We have also identified a number of wells on our acreage that are prospective for natural gas production from the J-Sand and D-Sand formations.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Adena Field Project was producing approximately 100 gross barrels of oil per day from 20 J-Sand wells and 10 D-Sand wells at a depth of approximately 5,500 feet. One J sand gas producer was temporarily shut-in because of low natural gas prices and due to reservoir management practices. Multiple wells are off production because they require maintenance work; however, we have delayed maintenance expenditures due to low commodity prices. We intend to pursue our reactivation and recompletion strategy once oil prices recover.

&#160;

Our working interest in our Adena Field Project is subject to a 30% reversionary working interest that will be assigned to an unrelated third party after payout of all acquisition, operating, development, and financing costs including interest (approximately $33 million at December 31, 2015).

&#160;

Niobrara &#8211; Colorado &#38; Nebraska 

&#160;

Our Niobrara Project is located in the northeastern portion of the D-J Basin, where we owned a 100% working interest in approximately 56,465 gross acres as of December 31, 2015. Our acreage is located in Phillips and Sedgwick Counties, Colorado, and Perkins County, Nebraska.

&#160;

Approximately 21,000 acres in this project are held by production and leases on approximately 17,500 acres expire after 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we owned a 100% working interest in 24 Niobrara gas wells and we owned approximately a 6% overriding royalty interest in 180 Niobrara gas wells that are operated by Atlas Resources, LLC. All of these wells are located in Amherst Field in Phillips and Sedgwick Counties, Colorado. As of December 31, 2015, we produced approximately 125 net mcf of natural gas per day from the Niobrara formation at a depth of approximately 2,500 feet.

&#160;

Our existing Niobrara acreage was high-graded based on structural features identified through analysis of 114 miles of 2D and 165 square miles (105,000 acres) of 3D seismic data on our original position of 330,000 net acres. We have identified more than 150 highly-ranked Niobrara drilling locations on our acreage based on 3D seismic analysis, which has historically yielded success rates of approximately 90% in this play. Our acreage is well situated with direct access to the Cheyenne Hub market in immediate proximity to the 1,679-mile Rocky Mountain Express pipeline and the 436-mile Trailblazer pipeline.

&#160; 

In 2015, we consummated a joint venture with third party industry partners to drill exploration wells targeting deeper potential pay zones in our Niobrara project acreage. Per the terms of the joint venture agreement, our industry partners agreed to pay 100% of drilling and completion costs of the first four exploration wells drilled in the project area. We drilled the first two exploration wells during the fourth quarter 2015, and we elected to plug and abandon those wells. Future test wells are not planned at this time.

&#160; 

DJ Basin Resource Play Exposure 

&#160;

Other operators in the DJ basin have recently permitted, drilled and tested numerous wells on trend with our Niobrara Project acreage and our Adena Field Project acreage. These operators are targeting oil production from conventional reservoirs and unconventional resource plays in Permian and Pennsylvanian aged carbonates and shales. These plays are in the early stages of exploration and development, and widespread economic success has not yet been established. We continue to monitor these exploration efforts closely and we currently own and control all depths that are prospective for these plays under all of our current acreage position.

Mississippian Project 

&#160; 

Our Mississippian Project is located in Woodson and Greenwood Counties in Southeast Kansas, where we owned a 90% working interest in 3,880 gross acres. Approximately 73.5% of the gross leased acres in this project are currently held-by-production.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our Mississippian Project was producing approximately 125 gross barrels of oil per day from the Mississippian formation at a depth of approximately 1,700 feet.

&#160;

Cherokee Project 

&#160;

Our Cherokee Project is located in Miami and Franklin Counties in Eastern Kansas, where we owned an average working interest of 86% in 10,252 gross acres as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

On August 12, 2015, EnerJex Resources, Inc., through its subsidiaries, EnerJex Kansas, Inc., and Working Interest, LLC, sold the Cherokee Project for approximately $2.8 million to Haas Petroleum, LLC, BAM Petroleum, LLC and MorMeg, LLC. The effective date of the sale was July 1, 2015.

El Toro Project 

&#160;

Our El Toro Project is located in Atascosa and Frio Counties in South Texas. As of December 31, 2015, we owned a 60% working interest in 458 gross acres. As of December 31, 2015, this project was producing approximately 10 gross barrels of oil per day from the Olmos formation at a depth of approximately 4,500 feet.

&#160;

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our principal strategy focuses on the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties that have low production decline rates and offer drilling opportunities with low risk profiles. Our oil and gas operations are in Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas. The principal elements of our business strategy are:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Develop Our Existing Properties. Creating production, cash flow, and reserve growth by developing our inventory of hundreds of drilling locations that we have identified on our existing properties. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Maximize Operational Control. We seek to operate and maintain a substantial working interest in the majority of our properties. We believe the ability to control our drilling inventory will provide us with the opportunity to more efficiently allocate capital, manage resources, control operating and development costs, and utilize our experience and knowledge of oil and gas field technologies. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Pursue Selective Acquisitions and Joint Ventures. We believe our local presence in Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas makes us well-positioned to pursue selected acquisitions and joint venture arrangements. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Reduce Unit Costs Through Economies of Scale and Efficient Operations. As we increase our oil and gas production and develop our existing properties, we expect that our unit cost structure will benefit from economies of scale. In particular, we anticipate reducing unit costs by greater utilization of our existing infrastructure over a larger number of wells. &#160;

Our future financial results will continue to depend on:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the market price for oil, gas and natural gas liquids; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; our ability to preserve sufficient working capital and maintain access to capital resources; &#160;

&#160; &#183; our ability to cost effectively manage our operations; &#160;

&#160; &#183; our ability to source and evaluate potential projects; &#160;

&#160; &#183; our ability to discover and exploit commercial quantities of oil and gas; &#160;

&#160; &#183; our ability to implement our exploration and development program. &#160;

We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in any of these respects. Further, we cannot know if the price of crude oil and natural gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production, or that we will be able to obtain additional funding at terms favorable to us to increase our capital resources. A detailed description of these and other risks that could materially impact our actual results is in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under ITEM 1A.

&#160;

Reserves 

&#160;

Proved Reserves 

&#160;

The estimated total PV10 (present value) of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 was $ 8.8 million, compared to $64.3 million as of December 31, 2014. Our total net proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 were 2.6 million BOE (59% oil), compared to 4.4 million BOE (69% oil) as of December 31, 2014. Of the 2.6 million net BOE of total proved reserves at December 31, 2015, approximately 39.0% are classified as proved developed producing, approximately 32.9% are classified as proved developed non-producing, and approximately 28.1% are classified as proved undeveloped. See &#8220;Glossary&#8221; on page 17 for our definition of PV10.

&#160;

The estimated PV10 of the 2.6 million BOE is set forth in the following table. The PV10 is calculated using an average net oil price of $50.28 per barrel, an average net natural gas price of $2.58 per mcf and an average natural gas liquids price of $9.80 per barrel, and by applying an annual discount rate of 10% to the forecasted future net cash flow.

&#160;

In 2015 the Company invested approximately $250,000 in its oil and gas properties. These reduced expenditures were primarily in response to extremely low commodity prices. The Company has $7.4 million of current asset on hand, approximately $3.7 million of unrealized hedge gains and important infrastructure in Colorado completed which will facilitate the exploitation and development of proved undeveloped reserves over the next five years. At year end the Company&#8217;s review of proved undeveloped reserves revealed no instances of reserves that have not been developed within five years of their initial recording as a proved undeveloped reserve. In addition it believes it has the financial wherewithal to develop all it&#8217;s proved undeveloped reserves within the five year time frames required; utilizing its balance sheet, it borrowed $.5 million from its bank in January 2015 and has the ability to joint venture any of its assets.

Oil and Gas Reserves Reported to Other Agencies 

&#160;

We did not file any estimates of total proved net oil and gas reserves with, or include such information in reports to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, during the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Title to Properties 

&#160;

We believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, minimal investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. In most cases, we investigate title and obtain title opinions from counsel or have title reviewed by professional landmen only when we acquire producing properties or before we begin drilling operations. However, any acquisition of producing properties without obtaining title opinions is subject to a greater risk of title defects.

&#160;

Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens under indebtedness, liens incident to operating agreements and liens for current taxes and other burdens, including mineral encumbrances and restrictions. Further, our debt is secured by liens substantially on all of our assets. These burdens have not materially interfered with the use of our properties in the operation of our business to date, though there can be no assurance that such burdens will not materially impact our operations in the future

&#160; 

11&#160;

&#160;

Sale of Oil and Gas 

&#160;

We do not intend to refine our oil production. We expect to sell all or most of our production to a small number of purchasers in a manner consistent with industry practices at prevailing rates by means of long-term and short-term sales contracts, some of which may have fixed price components. In 2015, we sold oil to ARM Energy Management LLC, Coffeyville Resources, Inc., Plains Marketing LP, MV Purchasing, and Sunoco Logistics, Inc. on a month-to-month basis (i.e., without a long-term contract). We sold our natural gas to United Energy Trading on a month-to-month basis and Western Operating Company under a long-term contract. Under current conditions, we should be able to find other purchasers, if needed. All of our produced oil is held in tank batteries. Each respective purchaser picks up the oil from our tank batteries and transports it by truck to refineries. In addition, our Board of Directors has implemented a crude oil and gas hedging strategy that will allow management to hedge the majority of our net production in an effort to mitigate our exposure to changing oil and natural gas prices in the intermediate term. We have an ISDA master agreement and a deferred premium put options with BP through December 31, 2016. 

&#160;

Secondary Recovery and Other Production Enhancement Strategies 

&#160;

When an oil field is first produced, the oil typically is recovered as a result of natural pressure within the producing formation, often assisted by pumps of various types. The only natural force present to move the crude oil to the wellbore is the pressure differential between the higher pressure in the formation and the lower pressure in the wellbore. At the same time, there are many factors that act to impede the flow of crude oil, depending on the nature of the formation and fluid properties, such as pressure, permeability, viscosity and water saturation. This stage of production is referred to as &#8220;primary production&#8221;, which typically only recovers 5% to 15% of the crude oil originally in place in a producing formation.

&#160;

Production from oil fields can often be enhanced through the implementation of &#8220;secondary recovery&#8221;, also known as water flooding, which is a method in which water is injected into the reservoir through injector wells in order to maintain or increase reservoir pressure and push oil to the adjacent producing wellbores. We utilize water flooding as a secondary recovery technique for the majority of our oil properties in Kansas, even in the early stages of production and we use a secondary recovery technique in parts of the Adena Field Project in Colorado.

&#160;

As a water flood matures over time, the fluid produced contains increasing amounts of water and decreasing amounts of oil. Surface equipment is used to separate the produced oil from water, with the oil going to holding tanks for sale and the water being re-injected into the oil reservoir.

&#160;

In addition, we may utilize 3D seismic analysis, horizontal drilling, and other technologies and production techniques to improve drilling results and oil recovery, and to ultimately enhance our production and returns. We also believe use of such technologies and production techniques in exploring for, developing, and exploiting oil properties will help us reduce drilling risks, lower finding costs and provide for more efficient production of oil from our properties.

&#160;

Markets and Marketing 

&#160;

The oil and gas industry has experienced dramatic price volatility in recent years. As a commodity, global oil prices respond to macro-economic factors affecting supply and demand. In particular, world oil prices have risen and fallen in response to political unrest and supply uncertainty in the Middle East, and changing demand for energy in rapidly emerging market economies, notably India and China. North American prospects became more attractive as oil prices rose worldwide. Escalating conflicts in the Middle East and the ability of OPEC to control supply and pricing are some of the factors impacting the availability of global supply. As a commodity, natural gas prices respond mainly to regional supply and demand imbalances. Factors that affect the supply side include production of natural gas, levels of natural gas imports and fluctuations in underground storage. Factors that affect the demand side include peak demand brought on by winter heating and summer cooling requirements and increasing demand from the petrochemical industry for their produced products such as plastics, fertilizers, paints, soaps etc. The costs of steel and other products used to construct drilling rigs and pipeline infrastructure, as well as, drilling and well-servicing rig rates, are impacted by the commodity price volatility.

&#160;

Our market is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability of other domestic production, commodity prices, the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines, and general fluctuations of global and domestic supply and demand. In 2015 had month-to-month sales contracts with ARM Energy Management LLC, Coffeyville Resources, Inc., Plains Marketing LP, MV Purchasing, Sunoco Logistics, Inc., United Energy Trading and Western Operating Company and we do not anticipate difficulty in finding additional sales opportunities, as and when needed.

&#160;

Oil and gas sales prices are negotiated based on factors such as the spot price or posted price for oil and gas, price regulations, regional price variations, hydrocarbon quality, distances from wells to pipelines, well pressure, and estimated reserves. Many of these factors are outside our control. Oil and gas prices have historically experienced high volatility, related in part to ever-changing perceptions within the industry of future supply and demand.

&#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive and we must compete against larger companies that may have greater financial and technical resources than we do and substantially more experience in our industry. These competitive advantages may better enable our competitors to sustain the impact of higher exploration and production costs, oil and gas price volatility, productivity variances between properties, overall industry cycles and other factors related to our industry. Their advantage may also negatively impact our ability to acquire prospective properties, develop reserves, attract and retain quality personnel and raise capital.

&#160;

Research and Development Activities 

&#160;

We have not spent a material amount of time or money on research and development activities in the last two years.

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

Our oil and gas exploration, production and related operations, when developed, are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies that impose requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. For example, laws and regulations often address conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells, rates of production, water discharge, prevention of waste, and other matters. Prior to drilling, we are often required to obtain permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and file reports concerning operations. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Moreover, laws and regulations may place burdens from previous operations on current lease owners that can be significant.

&#160;

The public attention on the production of oil and gas will most likely increase the regulatory burden on our industry and increase the cost of doing business, which may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

The price we may receive from the sale of oil and gas will be affected by the cost of transporting products to markets. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil and gas pipelines, which, generally, would index such rates to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with certainty the effect, if any, of these regulations on our intended operations. However, the regulations may increase transportation costs or reduce well head prices for oil and natural gas.

&#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue.

&#160;

These laws and regulations may:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; &#160;

&#160; &#183; limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations, or due to previous operations conducted on any leased lands. &#160;

The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and gas industry in general.

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of &#8220;solid waste&#8221; and &#8220;hazardous waste&#8221; and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of &#8220;hazardous substance,&#8221; state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil and gas field wastes as &#8220;non-hazardous&#8221;, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.

&#160;

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (&#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. These laws also regulate the discharge of storm water in process areas. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater and storm water and develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as &#8220;SPCC plans&#8221;, in connection with on-site storage of greater than threshold quantities of oil and gas. The EPA issued revised SPCC rules in July 2002 whereby SPCC plans are subject to more rigorous review and certification procedures. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable Clean Water Act and analogous state requirements, including those relating to wastewater and storm water discharges and SPCC plans.

&#160;

The Endangered Species Act, as amended (&#8220;ESA&#8221;), seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject us to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force us to discontinue certain operations altogether.

&#160;

Personnel 

&#160;

We currently have 16 full-time employees, including field personnel. As production and drilling activities increase or decrease, we may have to continue to adjust our technical, operational and administrative personnel as appropriate. We are using and will continue to use independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly in the area of land services, reservoir engineering, geology, drilling, water hauling, pipeline construction, well design, well-site monitoring and surveillance, permitting and environmental assessment. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating and general expenses, and capital costs.

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160;

Executive offices are maintained at 4040 Broadway, Suite 508, San Antonio, Texas 78209 under a lease expiring November 2017. We also have a field office located at 165 South Union Blvd, Suite 410, Lakewood Colorado 80228, under a lease which expires October 2019.

Exploratory Drilling &#160; Drilling of a relatively high percentage of properties which are unproven. &#160; &#160; &#160; Farm Out &#160; An arrangement whereby the owner of a lease assigns all or some portion of the lease or licenses to another company for undertaking exploration or development activity. &#160; &#160; &#160; Fixed Price Swap &#160; A derivative instrument that exchanges or &#8220;swaps&#8221; the &#8220;floating&#8221; or daily price of a specified volume of oil or natural gas over a specified period, for a fixed price for the specified volume over the same period (typically three months or longer). &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross Acre &#160; The number of acres in which the Company owns any working interest. &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross Producing Well &#160; A well in which a working interest is owned and is producing oil or gas. The number of gross producing wells is the total number of wells producing oil or gas in which a working interest is owned. &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross Well &#160; A well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. &#160; &#160; &#160; Held-By-Production (HBP) &#160; Refers to an oil and gas property under lease, in which the lease continues to be in force, because of production from the property. &#160; &#160; &#160; Horizontal drilling &#160; A drilling technique used in certain formations where a well is drilled vertically to a certain depth and then turned and drilled horizontally. Horizontal drilling allows the wellbore to follow the desired formation. &#160; &#160; &#160; In-Fill Wells &#160; In-fill wells refers to wells drilled between established producing wells; a drilling program to reduce the spacing between wells in order to increase production and recovery of in-place hydrocarbons. &#160; &#160; &#160; Oil and Gas Lease &#160; A legal instrument executed by a mineral owner granting the right to another to explore, drill, and produce subsurface oil and gas. An oil and gas lease embodies the legal rights, privileges and duties pertaining to the lessor and lessee. &#160; &#160; &#160; Lifting Costs &#160; The expenses of producing oil and gas from a well. Lifting costs are the operating costs of the wells including the gathering and separating equipment. Lifting costs do not include the costs of drilling and completing the wells or transporting the oil and gas. &#160; &#160; &#160; MCF &#160; An abbreviation for one thousand cubic feet of natural gas. &#160; &#160; &#160; Net Acres &#160; Determined by multiplying gross acres by the working interest that the Company owns in such acres. &#160; &#160; &#160; Net Producing Wells &#160; The number of producing wells multiplied by the working interest in such wells. &#160; &#160; &#160; Net Revenue Interest &#160; A share of production revenues after all royalties, overriding royalties and other non-operating interests have been taken out of production for a well(s). &#160; &#160; &#160; Operator &#160; A person, acting for itself, or as an agent for others, designated to conduct the operations on its or the joint interest owners&#8217; behalf. &#160;

&#160;

Overriding Royalty &#160; Ownership in a percentage of production or production revenues, free of the cost of production, created by the lessee, company and/or working interest owner and paid by the lessee, company and/or working interest owner out of revenue from the well. &#160; &#160; &#160; Probable Reserves &#160; Probable reserves are additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with Proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved Developed Reserves &#160; Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. This definition of proved developed reserves has been abbreviated from the applicable definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) (2-4) of Regulation S-X. &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved Developed Non-Producing &#160; Proved developed reserves expected to be recovered from zones behind casings in existing wells or from future production increases resulting from the effects of water flood operations. &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved Reserves &#160; Proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved Undeveloped Reserves &#160; Proved undeveloped reserves are the portion of proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. This definition of proved undeveloped reserves has been abbreviated from the applicable definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) (2-4) of Regulation S-X. &#160; &#160; &#160; PV10 &#160; PV10 means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development and abandonment costs, using prices and costs in effect at the determination date, before income taxes, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses, discounted to a present value using an annual discount rate of 10% in accordance with the guidelines of the SEC. PV10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reserves&#8221; on page 33 for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure. &#160; &#160; &#160; Reactivation &#160; After the initial completion of a well, the action and techniques of reentering the well and redoing or repairing the original completion to restore the well&#8217;s productivity. &#160; &#160; &#160; Recompletion &#160; Completion of an existing well for production from one formation or reservoir to another formation or reservoir that exists behind casing of the same well. &#160; &#160; &#160; Reservoir &#160; The underground rock formation where oil and gas has accumulated. It consists of a porous rock to hold the oil and gas, and a cap rock that prevents its escape. &#160;

Secondary Recovery &#160; The stage of hydrocarbon production during which an external fluid such as water or natural gas is injected into the reservoir through injection wells located in rock that has fluid communication with production wells. The purpose of secondary recovery is to maintain reservoir pressure and to displace hydrocarbons toward the wellbore. The most common secondary recovery techniques are natural gas injection and water flooding. Normally, natural gas is injected into the natural gas cap and water is injected into the production zone to sweep oil and gas from the reservoir. A pressure-maintenance program can begin during the primary recovery stage, but it is a form of enhanced recovery. &#160; &#160; &#160; Stock Tank Barrel or STB &#160; A stock tank barrel of oil and gas is the equivalent of 42 U.S. Gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; &#160; Undeveloped Acreage &#160; Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. &#160; &#160; &#160; Unitize, Unitization &#160; When owners of oil and gas reservoir pool their individual interests in return for an interest in the overall unit. &#160; &#160; &#160; Water flood &#160; The injection of water into an oil and gas reservoir to &#8220;push&#8221; additional oil and gas out of the reservoir rock and into the wellbores of producing wells. Typically a secondary recovery process. &#160; &#160; &#160; Water Injection Wells &#160; A well in which fluids are injected rather than produced, the primary objective typically being to maintain or increase reservoir pressure, often pursuant to a water flood. &#160; &#160; &#160; Water Supply Wells &#160; A well in which fluids are being produced for use in a water injection well. &#160; &#160; &#160; Wellbore &#160; A borehole; the hole drilled by the bit. A wellbore may have casing in it or it may be open (uncased); or part of it may be cased, and part of it may be open. Also called a borehole or hole. &#160; &#160; &#160; Working Interest &#160; An interest in an oil and gas lease entitling the owner to receive a specified percentage of the proceeds of the sale of oil and gas production or a percentage of the production, but requiring the owner of the working interest to bear the cost to explore for, develop and produce such oil and gas. &#160;
