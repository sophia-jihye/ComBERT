Company Background 

ICU Medical, Inc. was founded in 1984 and our initial public offering was in 1992. In 1993, we launched the Clave, an innovative one-piece needlefree intravenous ("I.V.") connection device. In 1998, we developed a computerized manufacturing process called SetMaker that enables us to design a custom infusion set to a customer's exact specifications and commence production in less than one day from receiving the order. Since the late 1990's, we have expanded our product offerings by introducing internally developed products and systems and from acquisitions. Key developments have included the Tego needlefree connector for use in hemodialysis, products for handling hazardous drugs including the ChemoClave and ChemoLock CSTDs, the Diana hazardous drug compounding system, the Neutron, a catheter patency device and NanoClave, a series of MicroClave Clear derivatives which are uniquely designed for incorporation into custom manifolds and sets. In August 2009, we purchased all commercial rights and physical assets from Hospira's critical care product line, which provided us control over all aspects of our critical care product line. In October 2015, we acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation&#8217;s SwabCap disinfecting cap for needlefree I.V. connectors to enhance our direct and OEM infusion therapy product offerings and to open new customer opportunities globally. 

&#160; 

&#32;3 

We began our relationship with Pfizer and its predecessor companies in 1995. In 2011, our agreements were extended through December 2018. All of our existing Hospira agreements survived the September 2015 acquisition by Pfizer.

Products 

Infusion Therapy 

Infusion therapy lines, used in hospitals and ambulatory clinics, consist of a tube running from a bottle or plastic bag containing a solution to a catheter inserted in a patient&#8217;s vein. The tube typically has several injection ports or Y-sites (conventionally, entry tubes covered by rubber caps) to which a secondary infusion line can be connected to permit constant I.V. administration of medications, fluids and nutrients, and to allow instantaneous I.V. administration of medication. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Clave Needlefree Technology 

&#160; 

Prior to the introduction of needle-safe connectors, a conventional infusion line terminated with a male luer connector to which a hollow-bore needle would be attached to penetrate an injection port to make a primary or secondary connection. With the Clave technology, instead of attaching a hollow-bore needle to the male luer, the male luer without a needle is simply attached directly to the needlefree Clave port. 

&#160; 

All types of medications can be administered through the Clave by using a standard syringe or various types of administration sets. The Clave can be used with any conventional peripheral or central vascular access device, both for venous and arterial applications. The resilience of the silicone compression seal permits repeated connections and disconnections without replacing the Clave. The Clave contains no natural rubber latex. 

The MicroClave is smaller than the standard Clave but is functionally similar. The MicroClave has a feature where upon disconnection of an infusion set or syringe, there is a neutral displacement of fluid. This allows clinicians to utilize known protocols without the risk of device failure and a saline flush regimen which reduces cost and exposure to the drug heparin. The MicroClave is intended for use on all peripheral and central catheters, which allows it to be used throughout the hospital and reduces line items that the hospital may need to carry and the educational burden of having multiple devices. The MicroClave Clear is functionally identical to the MicroClave, and has a clear housing so that clinicians can visualize the fluid path. 

The NanoClave is a derivative of the MicroClave, where it is incorporated into custom manifolds and components to be used in highly customized applications generally found in neonatal and pediatric patient populations. The NanoClave is also a neutral displacement connector with a clear housing, allowing clinicians to flush the connector clear of medications and blood with minimal flush volumes. 

Neutron 

The Neutron catheter patency device also features Clave technology, but includes a bi-directional silicone bellows that helps prevent blood reflux into a catheter to minimize the incidence of occlusion, or blocking of the catheter due to a blood clot. The Neutron was specifically designed to be used on patients receiving longer indwelling central venous catheters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#32;4 

Tego 

The Tego is a needlefree hemodialysis connector that creates a mechanically and microbiologically closed system when attached to the hub of a catheter, eliminating open catheter hubs and lowering the chance of bacterial contamination and infection. 

SwabCap 

SwabCap is a disposable cap designed to disinfect needlefree connectors with 70% isopropyl alcohol. The SwabCap product line complements the Clave family of needlefree connectors, as both work together to deliver the critical elements of safety, protection and maintenance of I.V. catheters. 

Custom Infusion Sets 

&#160; 

We have developed innovative software systems and manufacturing processes known as SetMaker and iFactory that permit us to design a custom infusion set to a hospital&#8217;s or clinician&#8217;s exact specifications, commence production within less than a day after we receive the customer order and ship smaller orders of the custom infusion sets to the customer within three days of receipt. While we are capable of meeting customer demand on this accelerated three-day schedule, in normal circumstances we ship within twenty-one to thirty days of receipt of the customers&#8217; order. This is a fraction of the time required by other custom set manufacturers. 

&#160; 

We serve as the exclusive manufacturer for certain custom I.V. products that are sold by a subsidiary of Pfizer. These products are promoted under the name SetSource. 

&#160; 

Infusion Therapy sales accounted for $244.8 million, or 72% , of our revenue in 2015 , $216.3 million , or 70% , of our revenue in 2014 &#32;and $221.2 million, or 71% , of our revenue in 2013 . Additional information regarding infusion therapy sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Critical Care Products 

&#160; 

Critical care products are used to monitor vital signs as well as specific physiological functions of key organ systems. We manufacture hemodynamic monitoring systems, vascular and cardiac catheters and monitoring systems and custom and interventional radiology kits that are used to monitor cardiac function and blood oxygen levels in critically ill patients. They include all components of the invasive monitoring system. Most of our critical care products can be sold in custom systems containing specific components to meet the individual needs of the customer, and in some cases, custom made or acquired components. 

The primary critical care products we manufacture are the following: 

&#160; 

Hemodynamic Monitoring Systems: &#32; Q2 Plus&#8482; CCO/SvO 2 &#32;(continuous cardiac output/oximetry) computer providing advanced hemodynamic monitoring with unparalleled accuracy and reliability; and Cogent&#8482; 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system providing minimally invasive and invasive hemodynamic monitoring technologies in a single, lightweight system with wireless communication (pending USFDA 510(k) clearance, not available for commercial sale). 

SafeSet &#174; &#32;Closed Blood Sampling and Conservation System: Blood sampling systems that provide the clinician with a convenient, needlefree method to obtain a patient&#8217;s blood sample and to administer I.V. fluids or drugs in conjunction with blood pressure monitoring devices. They are designed to protect the clinician from exposure to blood borne pathogens, reduce the risk of I.V. line contamination and reduce blood waste for the patient. 

Other Critical Care Products: Catheters, Lopez Valve &#174; &#32;and cables and accessories for hemodynamic monitoring. 

Critical care sales accounted for $54.3 million , or 16% , of our revenue in 2015 , $55.1 million , or 18% , of our revenue in 2014 &#32;and $54.3 million , or 17% , of our revenue in 2013 . Additional information regarding critical care sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#32;5 

Oncology 

&#160; 

Oncology products, known as CSTDs are used to prepare and deliver hazardous medications such as those used in chemotherapy, which, if released, can have harmful effects to the healthcare worker and environment. In 2007, we introduced the ChemoClave CSTD, which incorporates Clave technology, and in 2013, we introduced the ChemoLock CSTD. 

The preparation of hazardous drugs typically takes place in a pharmacy location where drugs are removed from vials and prepared for delivery to a patient. Those prepared drugs are then transferred to a nursing unit where the chemotherapy is administered via an infusion pump set to a patient. Components of the ChemoClave and ChemoLock product lines are used both in Pharmacy and on the nursing floors for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Custom design capability allows for a specialized product mix within the ChemoClave and ChemoLock systems to best adapt to the existing hazardous drug handling workflow. 

The primary oncology products we manufacture are the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

ChemoLock Needlefree CSTD: ChemoLock was the first CSTD to receive FDA 510(k) clearance for both pharmacy (ONB) and patient administration (FPA) applications. ChemoLock prevents the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, blocks the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury. 

&#8226; 

ChemoClave Needlefree CSTD: ChemoClave utilizes standard ISO luer locking connections, making it compatible with all brands of needlefree connectors and pump delivery systems. ChemoClave also prevents the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, blocks the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury. 

&#8226; 

Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System: Diana is an automated sterile compounding system that incorporates ChemoClave and Chemolock disposables for the accurate, safe, and efficient preparation of hazardous drugs. It is a user-controlled automated system that provides repeatable accuracy of drug mixes, minimizes clinician exposure to hazardous drugs and reduces the risk of repetitive motion stresses for the clinician while helping to maintain the sterility of the drugs being mixed. 

Oncology sales accounted for $41.4 million , or 12% , of our revenue in 2015 , $36.7 million , or 12% , of our revenue in 2014 &#32;and $36.9 million, or 12% , of our revenue in 2013 . Additional information regarding oncology sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Other Revenues 

&#32; 

We have a significant number of patents on the technology in our products and methods used to manufacture them. We have continuing royalty and revenue share income from our technology and from time to time may receive license fees or royalties from other entities for the use of our technology. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 148 &#32;people worldwide in sales, marketing and customer support. Our sales administrative operations are in San Clemente, California, Roncanova, Italy, Utrecht, Netherlands, Bella Vista, NSW Australia, Ludenscheid, Germany and Johannesburg, South Africa. We ship around the world with the majority of our sales denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro. 

Domestic Sales 

Domestic sales include direct and OEM U.S. sales. Total domestic sales were $241.9 million, $212.7 million and $223.1 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

&#160; 

&#32;6 

Direct 

Direct domestic sales includes sales both to our distributors and directly to the end user of our products. Direct domestic sales accounted for 39% of our worldwide revenue in 2015. Distributors purchase and stock our products for resale to healthcare providers. One distributor accounted for 7% and one distributor accounted for 5% of revenue in 2015. All other distributors accounted for less than 5% of revenue in 2015. Although the loss of one or more of our larger distributors could have an adverse effect on our business, we believe we could readily locate other distributors in the same territories who could continue to distribute our products to the same customers. 

OEM 

&#160; 

We distribute our products as an OEM supplier to Pfizer. We began this relationship in 1995. In 2011, our agreements were extended through December 2018. Pfizer is a major supplier of infusion pumps and I.V. solutions, and helps us achieve market share where they have multiple products under contract with a customer or broader international distribution channels than we can have on our own. Our agreement with Pfizer provides them with conditional rights to distribute certain of our Clave and other products to certain categories of customers both in the United States and foreign countries. Depending on the product and category of customer, these rights may be exclusive or nonexclusive. Domestic sales to Pfizer accounted for approximately 32% &#32;of our worldwide revenue in 2015 . The loss of Pfizer as a customer would have a significant adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

&#160; 

Pfizer purchases Clave products both as finished goods end-products for distribution to healthcare providers and in bulk for assembly into Pfizer infusion disposable products. The MicroClave, MicroClave Clear, ChemoClave CSTD and pre-pierced connector products are purchased and packaged separately as finished good end products. We also serve as the exclusive manufacturer for certain custom I.V. products that are sold by a subsidiary of Pfizer. These products are promoted under the name SetSource. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we signed an exclusive agreement with Medline to supply them with SwabCaps for their SwabFlush syringe product used in infusion therapy. 

&#160; 

International Sales 

International sales were $99.8 million , $96.6 million &#32;and $90.6 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. International sales through our direct channels, including distributors and directly to the end customer, were $86.1 million, $81.2 million and $75.1 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. International sales as an OEM supplier to Pfizer were $13.7 million, $15.4 million and $15.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

In 2015, customers in Europe were served by our facilities in Slovakia, Netherlands, Italy and Germany. We serve the rest of the world from our facilities in the United States and Mexico. In 2015, we made the decision to begin shutting down our manufacturing facility in Slovakia and to move those products to our facility in Mexico. We expect to finish that process in the second half of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had 24 sales and sales support personnel serving Europe and 29 serving Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Canada. 

During 2015, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Terumo Corporation of Japan for Japan and certain smaller Asian countries. Under the agreement, we have agreed that Terumo will distribute our entire product portfolio, including I.V. therapy products, Oncology products, Diana and our SwapCap product line. We see Japan and Asia as a valuable growth market. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Manufacturing of our products involves injection molding of plastic and silicone parts, manual and automated assembly of the molded plastic parts and other components, quality control inspection, packaging and sterilization. We mold most of our proprietary components, and perform all assembly, quality control, inspection, packaging, labeling and shipping of our products. Our manufacturing operations function as a separate group, producing products for the marketing and sales groups. 

&#160; 

We own a fully integrated medical device manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah with approximately 450,000 square feet of state-of-the art manufacturing space. This building includes approximately 109,500 square feet of class 100,000 clean room area, approximately 36,000 square feet of other manufacturing space, approximately 77,000 square feet of warehouse space and approximately 155,000 square feet of office space. 

&#32;7 

Our state-of-the-art injection molding technology and highly automated assembly systems are designed to maintain a high level of product quality and achieve high volume production at low unit manufacturing costs. To achieve these advantages and to gain greater control over raw material and finished product delivery times, we mold the majority of our proprietary molded components. The raw materials for our molding operation are principally resins and silicones, and these materials are available from several sources. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that use resin. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices through our procurement and supply chain management practices. 

Most of our manual assembly is done at our facilities in Ensenada, Mexico and Vrable, Slovakia, each of which has an electron beam ("e-beam") sterilizer and which have approximately 250,000 square feet and 77,000 square feet, respectively, of space for production and warehousing. Principal products assembled manually in Mexico and Slovakia are used in conjunction with infusion therapy systems (which includes oncology) and critical care systems. In 2015, we made the decision to begin shutting down our manufacturing facility in Slovakia and to move those products to our facility in Mexico. We expect to finish that process in the second half of 2016. 

The majority of the infusion and oncology products we manufacture are sterilized in processes which use e-beam radiation. Most critical care products and other certain products are currently sterilized in processes using gamma radiation or ethylene oxide gas (&#8220;EO&#8221;). We have our own sterilization facilities at our plants in Mexico and Slovakia that are used to sterilize most of the products assembled in the respective plants. All other sterilization is done by independent contractors. 

&#160; 

We also assemble compounders in our leased facility in Ludenscheid, Germany and Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government regulation is a significant factor in the development, marketing and manufacturing of our products. The Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulates medical product manufacturers and their products under a number of statutes including the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;), and we and our products are subject to the regulations of the FDA. The FDC Act provides two basic review procedures for medical devices. Certain products may qualify for a submission authorized by Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, under which the manufacturer gives the FDA a pre-market notification of the manufacturer&#8217;s intention to commence marketing the product. The manufacturer must, among other things, establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a letter finding substantial equivalence. Some Medical Devices may qualify for the FDA as a Class II, 510(k) Exempt (Special Controls) medical device per 21 CFR 880.5440. These &#8220;Special Controls&#8221; are defined as: &#8220;Adherence to the normal FDA regulations such as the QSR, Complaints, etc. and a specific guidance document&#8221; but require no pre-market notification to the FDA. If a medical device does not qualify for the Section 510(k) procedure or the special controls exemption, the manufacturer must file a pre-market approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) application. This requires substantially more extensive pre-filing testing than the Section 510(k) procedure and involves a significantly longer FDA review process. FDA approval of a PMA application occurs only after the applicant has established safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA. Each of our current products has qualified for the Section 510(k) procedure, if needed, and we anticipate that any new products that we are likely to market will qualify for the expedited Section 510(k) clearance procedure, if needed. However, certain of our new products may require a lengthier time for clearance than we have experienced in the past, and there can be no assurance that a PMA application will not be required. Further, there is no assurance that other new products we develop or any manufacturers that we might acquire, or claims that we may make concerning those products, will qualify for expedited clearance rather than the more time consuming PMA procedure or that, in any case, they will receive clearance from the FDA. FDA regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive. Uncertainties as to time required to obtain FDA clearances or approvals could adversely affect the timing and expense of new product introductions. The FDA classifies all of the regulated products that we currently manufacture as Class II medical devices. Class II medical devices are subject to performance standards relating to one or more aspects of the design, manufacturing, testing and performance or other characteristics of the product in addition to general controls involving compliance with labeling and record keeping requirements. 

&#160; 

We must comply with FDA, International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) and European Council Directive 93/42/EEC (&#8220;Medical Device Directive&#8221;) regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices. The FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO require manufacturers to register and subject manufacturers to periodic FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO inspections of their manufacturing facilities. We are a FDA and ISO registered medical device manufacturer, and must demonstrate that we and our contract manufacturers comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Quality System Regulations (&#8220;QSR&#8221;). Under these regulations, the manufacturing process must be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures and the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer&#8217;s specifications must be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every critical aspect of the process. They also require investigation of any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the 

&#32;8 

products produced and detailed record keeping. Further, the FDA and ISO&#8217;s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements has been increasingly strict in recent years and seems likely to be even more stringent in the future. Failure to adhere to QSR and ISO standards would cause the products produced to be considered in violation of the applicable law and subject to enforcement action. The FDA and ISO monitor compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the FDA and ISO, and by subjecting them to periodic FDA and ISO inspections of manufacturing facilities. If an FDA or ISO inspector observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily, or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace. 

&#160; 

We believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable FDA and ISO regulations. There is no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the FDA and classified as Class II products, or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the FDA, ISO or agencies in other jurisdictions. In addition, changes in FDA, ISO or other federal or state health, environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business. 

To market our products in the European Community (&#8220;EC&#8221;), we must conform to additional requirements of the EC and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives. As a manufacturer that designs, manufactures and markets its own devices, we must comply with the quality management standards of EN ISO 13485. Those quality standards are similar to the QSR regulations. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers of medical devices must also conform to EC Directives such as Council Directive 93/42/EEC and their applicable annexes. Those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the EC. Once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the Medical Device Directive, the &#8220;CE&#8221; Mark may be affixed to its devices. The CE Mark gives devices unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the EC. 

&#160; 

We have demonstrated conformity to the regulation of EN ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Directive and we affix the CE Mark to our device labeling for product sold in member countries of the EC. 

We believe our products and systems are in compliance with all EC requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will conform or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the EC. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for infusion therapy, critical care and oncology products is intensely competitive. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon our continued innovation and the quality, convenience, reliability, patent protection and pricing of our products, in addition to access to distribution channels. We encounter significant competition in these markets both from global, large, established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our products based on innovation, safety, product quality, cost effectiveness, ease of use and convenience, as well as our ability to perceive and respond to changing customer needs. In the long term, we expect that our ability to compete will continue to be enhanced by our ability to reduce unit-manufacturing costs through improved production processes and higher volume production. 

In the infusion therapy market, we currently hold the market leading position for needlefree infusion devices, including the original Clave, the MicroClave and the MicroClave Clear. These products compete with, and currently contemplated new products will likely compete with, needlefree infusion devices and systems marketed by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (&#8220;Baxter&#8221;), B. Braun Medical, Inc. (&#8220;B. Braun&#8221;), Becton Dickinson and Company ("Becton Dickinson"), Fresenius Kabi ("Fresenius"), Pfizer in certain non-exclusive markets and others. Although we believe that our needlefree infusion devices and custom set manufacturing capabilities have distinct advantages over competing systems, there is no assurance that they will be able to compete successfully with these products. 

In the oncology market, we compete with other manufacturers of CSTDs for the safe handling of oncology drugs, most notably Becton Dickinson, and B. Braun. We believe that our current product offering provides benefits over these competing systems in several areas related to safety, ease of use, and cost; however, on-going innovation in this market space will be required, and there is no assurance that these innovations will be able to sustain continued growth. 

The market for our critical care devices is highly competitive and our success in this area has historically been based on competitive pricing, customer service and differentiated product features such as customization. The overall market for 

&#32;9 

critical care products has been shifting in recent years from the invasive pulmonary artery catheter segment to less invasive technologies to deliver patient hemodynamic status data. In 2015, we filed with the FDA for 510(k) clearance of the Cogent 2-in-1 Hemodynamic Monitoring System, which will combine invasive and minimally invasive technologies in a single monitor. 

Manufacturers of products with which we currently compete, or might compete with in the future, include large companies with an established presence in the healthcare products market and substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution, managerial and other resources. In particular, Baxter, Becton Dickinson (which acquired CareFusion), Fresenius and B. Braun are leading distributors of infusion and oncology systems, Edwards Life Sciences Corporation has a significant share of the critical care hemodynamic monitoring market, while Navilyst Medical, Inc., and Merit Medical Systems, Inc., are competitors in the angiography kit market. Several of these competitors have broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining contracts with a significant number of hospitals to supply substantially all of their product requirements in these areas. In order to achieve greater market penetration or maintain our existing market position, we have established strategic relationships with OEM customers such as Pfizer, Terumo, and Medline. 

We believe the success of our market-leading needlefree connector line has and will continue to motivate others to develop needlefree connectors, which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as ours. We are aware of a number of such products. We believe some of those products were developed by companies who currently have the distribution or financial capabilities equivalent to or greater than those that we have, and by other companies that we believe do not have similar capabilities, although some of those products may be distributed in the future by larger companies that do have such capabilities. We believe these products have had a moderate impact on our needlefree connector business to date, but there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with these or future products developed by others. 

We believe the success of our CSTD products has and will continue to motivate others to develop competing systems. Our ability to compete in the area of oncology will be particularly affected by clinical differentiation and quality of our products. While we believe we have advantages in these areas, there is no assurance that other companies will not be able to compete successfully with our CSTD products. 

We believe that our ability to compete in the custom products market depends upon the same factors affecting our existing products, but will be particularly affected by clinical differentiation, quality and delivery times to the customer. While we believe we have advantages in these areas, there is no assurance that other companies will not be able to compete successfully with our custom products. 

Patents 

&#160; 

We have United States and/or certain foreign patents relating to the technologies found in the Clave / MicroClave Connector, MicroClave Clear Connector, Neutron Connector, CLC2000 Connector, Tego Connector, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, Click Lock Technology, SwabCaps, Custom Set Design and Manufacturing Methods, and Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System. We have applications pending for additional United States and/or foreign patents on MicroClave Connector, Neutron Connector, Tego Connector, Y-Clave Connector with Integral Check Valve, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, and Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System. 

&#160; 

Within the last two years, ICU has received three U.S. patents covering our MicroClave Clear connector. As customer preference continues to migrate toward clear connectors, these patents will protect the market for our MicroClave Clear connector through 2032. We also have multiple continuation patent applications pending for a number of our products, which may issue in the future. 

Our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While we have obtained certain patents and applied for additional United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products, there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar devices or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. Our patents are important in preventing others from introducing competing products that are as effective as our products. The loss of patent protection on Clave/MicroClave, Neutron, ChemoClave and ChemoLock technologies, Custom Set Design and Manufacturing Systems could adversely affect our ability to exclude other manufacturers from producing effective competitive products and could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 

The fact that a patent is issued to us does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims that are infringed by our products.

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Litigation, which would result in substantial cost to us and in diversion of our resources, may be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Adverse determinations in such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have initiated litigation, and may continue to initiate litigation in the future, to enforce our intellectual property rights against those we believe to be infringing on our patents. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources.

Seasonality/Quarterly Results 

&#160; 

The healthcare business in the United States is subject to quarterly fluctuations due to frequency of illness during the seasons, elective procedures, and over the last few years, the economy. In Europe, the healthcare business generally slows down in the summer months due to vacations resulting in fewer elective surgeries. In addition, we can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers, which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels, and less by seasonality. Our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales, which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development costs include personnel costs and expenses related to the development of new products. Research and development costs were $15.7 million &#32;in 2015 , $18.3 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $12.4 million &#32;in 2013 . 

&#160; 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 2,446 &#32;full-time employees, consisting of 256 &#32;engaged in sales, marketing and administration and 2,190 &#32;in manufacturing, molding, product development and quality control, including 1,398 &#32;in Mexico and 233 &#32;in Slovakia.
