 Item 1. Business 

General 

&#160; 

Meta Financial, a registered unitary savings and loan holding company, is a Delaware corporation, the principal assets of which are all the issued and outstanding shares of the Bank, a federal savings bank, the accounts of which are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include Meta Financial and the Bank, and all subsidiaries of Meta Financial, direct or indirect, on a consolidated basis. 

The Bank, a wholly-owned full-service banking subsidiary of Meta Financial, is both a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves and a payments company providing services on a nationwide basis, as further described below. The business of the Bank consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, commercial and multi-family real estate, agricultural operations and real estate, construction, consumer loans (including tax refund advance loans), commercial operating loans, and premium finance loans. In addition to originating loans, the Bank also has contracted to sell loans, in this case principally tax refund advance loans, to third party buyers. The Bank also purchases loan participations from time to time from other financial institutions, but presently at a lower level compared to prior years, as well as mortgage-backed securities and other investments permissible under applicable regulations. 

In addition to its community-oriented lending and deposit gathering activities, the Bank&#8217;s various divisions issue prepaid cards, design innovative consumer credit products, sponsor Automatic Teller Machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;) into various debit networks, and offer tax refund-transfer services and other payment industry products and services. Through its activities, the Meta Payment Systems ("MPS") division of the Bank generates both fee income and low- and no cost deposits for the Bank. On December 2, 2014, the Bank purchased substantially all of the commercial loan portfolio and related assets of AFS/IBEX Financial Services Inc., (&#8220;AFS/IBEX&#8221;), an insurance premium financing company. The transaction has diversified the Company&#8217;s business and further expands its commercial loan portfolio and growth prospects. In addition, on September 8, 2015, the Bank purchased substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of Fort Knox Financial Services Corporation and its subsidiary, Tax Product Services, LLC (together &#8220;Refund Advantage&#8221;). The assets acquired by MetaBank in the acquisition include the Fort Knox operating platform and trade name, Refund Advantage&#174;, and other assets. More recently, on October 26, 2016, MetaBank entered into an agreement with certain H&#38;R Block&#174; entities to originate up to $1.45 billion and retain up to $750 million of interest-free refund advance loans for H&#38;R Block customers during the 2017 tax season. On November 1, 2016, the Bank purchased substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of EPS Financial, LLC ("EPS") from privately held Drake Enterprises, Ltd. ("Drake"). The assets acquired by MetaBank in the EPS acquisition include the EPS trade name, operating platform, and other assets. Also, on November 9, 2016, the Bank signed a definitive agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of privately-held Specialty Consumer Services LP ("SCS") relating to its consumer lending and tax advance business. These transactions expand the Company&#8217;s business into tax refund-transfer services for its customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; As noted in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; which is included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, MPS continues to expand and to play a very significant role in the Company&#8217;s financial performance. 

The Company completed the public offering of $75 million of 5.75% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures during fiscal year 2016. These notes are due August 15, 2026. The subordinated debentures were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $73.9 million, a substantial portion of which was invested in the Bank as Tier 1 capital. 

First Midwest Financial Capital Trust, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meta Financial, was established in July 2001 for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. 

&#160; 

Meta Financial and the Bank are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. See &#8220;Regulation&#8221; herein. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Bank has a total of ten full-service branch offices, one non-retail service branch in Memphis, Tennessee, and two agency offices, one in Texas and one in California. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary commercial banking market area includes the Iowa counties of Buena Vista, Dallas, and Polk, and the South Dakota counties of Brookings, Lincoln, Minnehaha, and Moody. South Dakota ranks 10 th &#32;and Iowa 14 th &#32;in &#8220;The Best States for Business and Careers&#8221; (Forbes.com, November 2016). Iowa has low corporate income and franchise taxes. South Dakota has no corporate income tax, personal income tax, personal property tax, business inventory tax, or inheritance tax. 

Storm Lake is located in Iowa&#8217;s Buena Vista County approximately 150 miles northwest of Des Moines and 200 miles southwest of Minneapolis. Like much of the state of Iowa, Storm Lake and the surrounding market area are highly dependent upon farming and agricultural markets. Major employers in the area include Buena Vista Regional Medical Center, Tyson Foods, Sara Lee Foods, and Buena Vista University. The NWI market operates two offices in Storm Lake. 

&#160; 

Brookings is located in Brookings County, South Dakota, approximately 50 miles north of Sioux Falls and 200 miles west of Minneapolis. The Bank&#8217;s market area encompasses approximately a 60-mile radius surrounding Brookings. The area is generally rural, and agriculture is a significant industry in the community. South Dakota State University is the largest employer in Brookings. The community also has several manufacturing companies, including 3M, Larson Manufacturing, Daktronics, Falcon Plastics, Twin City Fan, and Rainbow Play Systems, Inc. 

&#160; 

Des Moines, Iowa&#8217;s capital, is located in central Iowa and is the political, economic, and cultural capital of the state. Des Moines was ranked sixth in &#8220;The Best Places for Business and Careers&#8221; (Forbes.com, 2016). The Des Moines metro area is a center of insurance, printing, finance, retail and wholesale trades as well as industry, providing a diverse economic base. Major employers include Principal Life Insurance Company, Iowa Health &#8211; Des Moines, Mercy Hospital Medical Center, Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., City of Des Moines, United Parcel Service, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., Pioneer Hi Bred International Inc., and Wells Fargo. Universities and colleges in the area include Des Moines Area Community College, Drake University, Simpson College, Des Moines University, Grand View College, AIB College of Business, and Upper Iowa University. The unemployment rate in the Des Moines metro area was 3.6% as of September 2016. 

&#160; 

Sioux Falls is located at the crossroads of Interstates 29 and 90 in southeast South Dakota, 270 miles southwest of Minneapolis. On Forbes &#8217; October 2016 list of &#8220;The Best Small Places for Business and Careers,&#8221; Sioux Falls ranked second among the best small cities. Major employers in the area include Sanford Health, Avera McKennan Hospital and Health System, John Morrell &#38; Company, Citibank (South Dakota) NA, Sioux Falls School District 49-5, Wells Fargo Bank, and Hy-Vee Food Stores. Sioux Falls is home to Augustana College and The University of Sioux Falls. The unemployment rate in Sioux Falls was 2.0% as of September 2016. 

&#160; 

As noted above, several of the Company&#8217;s market areas are dependent on agriculture and agriculture-related businesses, which are exposed to exogenous risk factors such as weather conditions and commodity prices. Loss rates in the agricultural real estate and agricultural operating loan portfolios have been low in the previous two years, partially offset by the charge-off of one large agriculture relationship in the current fiscal year. Low average loss rates are primarily due to strong crop yields over the last few years, offset by lower grain prices in 2015 and 2016. Overall, these factors have created positive economic conditions for most farmers in our markets during this time period. Nonetheless, management still expects that future losses in this portfolio could be higher than recent historical experience. Management believes that the recent positive weather conditions within our markets have been offset by low commodity prices and high input costs, which have the potential to more than offset higher yields, producing a negative economic effect on our agricultural markets. 

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

General . The Company originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) residential mortgage loans in response to consumer demand. At September 30, 2016 , the Company had $850.8 million &#32;in fixed-rate loans and $75.1 million &#32;in ARM loans. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; which is included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on Asset/Liability Management. 

In addition, the Company has more recently focused its lending activities on the origination of commercial and multi-family real estate loans, agricultural-related loans, commercial operating loans, premium finance loans, and tax refund advance loans. The Company also continues to originate one-to-four family mortgage loans and traditional consumer loans. Other than tax refund advance loans, the Company originates most of its loans in its primary market area. At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s net loan portfolio totaled $919.5 million , or 22.9% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total assets, as compared to $706.3 million , or 27.9% , at September 30, 2015 . As noted above, the Bank recently signed an agreement to originate tax refund advance loans to customers of H&#38;R Block. 

&#160; 

Loan applications are initially considered and approved at various levels of authority, depending on the type and amount of the loan. The Company has a loan committee consisting of senior lenders and Market Presidents, and is led by the Chief Lending Officer. Loans in excess of certain amounts require approval by at least two members of the loan committee, a majority of the loan committee, or by the Company&#8217;s Board Loan Committee, which has responsibility for the overall supervision of the loan portfolio. The Company may discontinue, adjust, or create new lending programs to respond to competitive factors. The Company also created a Specialty Lending committee to oversee its insurance premium finance division and other specialized lending activities in which the Company may become involved. The Committee consists of senior personnel with diverse backgrounds well suited for oversight of these types of activities. Insurance premium finance loans in excess of certain amounts require approval from one or more members of the Committee. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of related borrowers totaled $32.5 million. The Company had 24 other lending relationships in excess of $7.5 million as of September 30, 2016 . At September 30, 2016 , two of these relationships had loans totaling $27.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, and were classified as either substandard or special mention. See &#8220;Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern, and Classified Assets.&#8221;

Includes demand loans, loans having no stated maturity and overdraft loans. 

One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Lending . One-to-four family residential mortgage loan originations, which are made primarily in the Company's market areas, are generated by the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts, its present customers, walk-in customers and referrals. At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s one-to-four family residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled $162.3 million , or 17.5% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total loans. See &#8220;Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities.&#8221; At September 30, 2016 , the average outstanding principal balance of a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan was approximately $0.1 million. At September 30, 2016, $0.1 million &#32;of the Company&#8217;s one-to-four family residential mortgage loans were non-performing. 

The Company offers fixed-rate and ARM loans for both permanent structures and those under construction. During the year ended September 30, 2016 , the Company originated $15.3 million &#32;of ARM loans and $81.2 million &#32;of fixed-rate loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate. The Company&#8217;s one-to-four family residential mortgage originations are secured primarily by properties located in its primary market area and surrounding areas. 

&#160; 

The Company originates one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with terms up to a maximum of 30 years and with loan-to-value ratios up to 100% of the lesser of the appraised value of the security property or the contract price. The Company generally requires that private mortgage insurance be obtained in an amount sufficient to reduce the Company&#8217;s exposure to at or below the 80% loan&#8209;to&#8209;value level. Residential loans generally do not include prepayment penalties. 

&#160; 

The Company currently offers five- and ten-year ARM loans. These loans have a fixed-rate for the stated period and, thereafter, adjust annually. These loans generally provide for an annual cap of up to 200 basis points and a lifetime cap of 600 basis points over the initial rate. As a consequence of using an initial fixed-rate and caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as the Company&#8217;s cost of funds. The Company&#8217;s ARMs do not permit negative amortization of principal and are not convertible into fixed-rate loans. The Company&#8217;s delinquency experience on its ARM loans has generally been similar to its experience on fixed-rate residential loans. The current low mortgage interest rate environment makes ARM loans relatively unattractive and very few are currently being originated. 

&#160; 

Due to consumer demand, the Company also offers fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years, most of which conform to secondary market, i.e. , Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac standards. The Company typically holds all fixed-rate mortgage loans and does not engage in secondary market sales. Interest rates charged on these fixed-rate loans are competitively priced according to market conditions. 

&#160; 

In underwriting one-to-four family residential real estate loans, the Company evaluates both the borrower&#8217;s ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan. Properties securing real estate loans made by the Company are appraised by independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors. The Company generally requires borrowers to obtain an attorney&#8217;s title opinion or title insurance, and fire and property insurance (including flood insurance, if necessary) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Company generally contain a &#8220;due on sale&#8221; clause allowing the Company to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property. The Company has not engaged in sub-prime residential mortgage originations. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending . The Company engages in commercial and multi-family real estate lending in its primary market area and surrounding areas and, in order to supplement its loan portfolio, has purchased participation interests in loans from other financial institutions. At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio totaled $422.9 million , or 45.7% , of the Company&#8217;s total loans. The purchased loans and loan participation interests are generally secured by properties located in the Midwest and West. See &#8220;Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities.&#8221; At September 30, 2016 , there were no commercial and multi&#8209;family real estate loans that were non-performing. See &#8220;Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern and Classified Assets.&#8221; 

The Company&#8217;s commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio is secured primarily by apartment buildings, office buildings, and hotels. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally are underwritten with terms not exceeding 20 years, have loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% of the appraised value of the security property, and are typically secured by personal guarantees of the borrowers. The Company has a variety of rate adjustment features and other terms in its commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans provide for a margin over a number of different indices. In underwriting these loans, the Company analyzes the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower&#8217;s credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property securing the loan. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are performed by independent appraisers. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s largest commercial and multi-family real estate lending relationship totaled $32.5 million and was secured by real estate. At September 30, 2016 , the average outstanding principal balance of a commercial or multi-family real estate loan held by the Company was approximately $1.4 million. 

&#160; 

Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effect of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations), the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 

&#160; 

Agricultural Lending . The Company originates loans to finance the purchase of farmland, livestock, farm machinery and equipment, seed, fertilizer and other farm-related products, primarily in its market areas. At September 30, 2016 , the Company had agricultural real estate loans secured by farmland of $63.6 million &#32;or 6.9% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total loans. At the same date, $37.1 million , or 4.0% , of the Company&#8217;s total loans consisted of secured loans related to agricultural operations. Agricultural-related lending constituted 10.9% &#32;of total loans. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s largest agricultural real estate and agricultural operating loan relationship was $27.8 million. At September 30, 2016 , the average outstanding principal balance of an agricultural real estate loan and agricultural operating loan held by the Company was approximately $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Agricultural operating loans are originated at either an adjustable or fixed-rate of interest for up to a one-year term or, in the case of livestock, upon sale. Such loans provide for payments of principal and interest at least annually or a lump sum payment upon maturity if the original term is less than one year. Loans secured by agricultural machinery are generally originated as fixed-rate loans with terms of up to seven years. At September 30, 2016 , there were no agricultural operating loans that were non-performing. 

&#160; 

Agricultural real estate loans are frequently originated with adjustable rates of interest. Generally, such loans provide for a fixed rate of interest for the first five to ten years, which then balloon or adjust annually thereafter. In addition, such loans generally amortize over a period of 20 to 25 years. Fixed-rate agricultural real estate loans generally have terms up to ten years. Agricultural real estate loans are generally limited to 75% of the value of the property securing the loan. At September 30, 2016 , none &#32;of the Company&#8217;s agricultural real estate loans were non-performing. 

Agricultural lending affords the Company the opportunity to earn yields higher than those obtainable on one-to-four family residential lending, but involves a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because of the typically larger loan amount. In addition, payments on loans are dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property securing the loan or for which an operating loan is utilized. The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower. 

&#160; 

Weather presents one of the greatest risks as hail, drought, floods, or other conditions can severely limit crop yields and thus impair loan repayments and the value of the underlying collateral. This risk can be reduced by the farmer with a variety of insurance coverages which can help to ensure loan repayment. Government support programs and the Company generally require that farmers procure crop insurance coverage. Grain and livestock prices also present a risk as prices may decline prior to sale, resulting in a failure to cover production costs. These risks may be reduced by the farmer with the use of futures contracts or options to mitigate price risk. The Company frequently requires borrowers to use futures contracts or options to reduce price risk and help ensure loan repayment. Another risk is the uncertainty of government programs and other regulations. During periods of low commodity prices, the income from government programs can be a significant source of cash for the borrower to make loan payments, and if these programs are discontinued or significantly changed, cash flow problems or defaults could result. Finally, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may result in an inability to successfully operate the farm. 

&#160; 

Consumer Lending . The Company, through the auspices of its &#8220;Retail Bank&#8221; (generally referring to the Company&#8217;s operations in our four market areas discussed above), originates a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, home improvement, automobile, boat and loans secured by savings deposits. In addition, the Retail Bank offers other secured and unsecured consumer loans. The Retail Bank currently originates most of its consumer loans in its primary market area and surrounding areas. At September 30, 2016 , the Retail Bank&#8217;s consumer loan portfolio totaled $22.8 million , or 2.5% &#32;of its total loans. Of the Retail Bank consumer loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 , $8.7 million &#32;were short- and intermediate-term, fixed-rate loans, while $14.1 million &#32;were adjustable-rate loans. 

&#160; 

The largest component of the Retail Bank&#8217;s consumer loan portfolio consists of home equity loans and lines of credit. Substantially all of the Retail Bank&#8217;s home equity loans and lines of credit are secured by second mortgages on principal residences. The Retail Bank will lend amounts which, together with all prior liens, may be up to 90% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have maximum terms of five years. 

&#160; 

The Retail Bank primarily originates automobile loans on a direct basis to the borrower, as opposed to indirect loans, which are made when the Retail Bank purchases loan contracts, often at a discount, from automobile dealers which have extended credit to their customers. The Bank&#8217;s automobile loans typically are originated at fixed interest rates with terms up to 60 months for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles are generally originated for up to 80% of the N.A.D.A. book value of the automobile securing the loan. 

&#160; 

Consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include an application, a determination of the applicant&#8217;s payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also may include a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. 

Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles or recreational equipment. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and thus more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. At September 30, 2016 , $0.1 million &#32;of the Bank&#8217;s consumer loans were non-performing. 

&#160; 

Consumer Lending - MPS . The Company believes that well-managed, nationwide credit programs can help meet legitimate credit needs for prime and sub-prime borrowers, and affords the Company an opportunity to diversify the loan portfolio and minimize earnings exposure due to economic downturns. Therefore, MPS designs and administers certain credit programs that seek to accomplish these objectives. The MPS Credit Committee, consisting of members of Executive Management of the Company, is charged with monitoring, evaluating and reporting portfolio performance and the overall credit risk posed by its credit products. All proposed credit programs must first be reviewed and approved by the committee before such programs are presented to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors for approval. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Bank&#8217;s MPS consumer loan portfolio totaled $14.3 million , or 1.5% &#32;of total loans, all of which were short-term, fixed rate loans. 

&#160; 

MPS strives to offer consumers innovative payment products, including credit products. Most credit products have fallen into the category of portfolio lending. MPS continues to work on new alternative portfolio lending products striving to serve its core customer base and to provide unique and innovative lending solutions to the unbanked and under-banked segment. 

&#160; 

A Portfolio Credit Policy which has been approved by the Board of Directors governs portfolio credit initiatives undertaken by MPS, whereby the Company retains some or all receivables and relies on the borrower as the underlying source of repayment. Several portfolio lending programs also have a contractual provision that requires the Bank to be indemnified for credit losses that meet or exceed predetermined levels. Such a program carries additional risks not commonly found in sponsorship programs, specifically funding and credit risk. Therefore, MPS has strived to employ policies, procedures and information systems that it believes commensurate with the added risk and exposure. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes concentrations of credit may naturally occur and may take the form of a large volume of related loans to an individual, a specific industry, a geographic location or an occupation. Credit concentration is a direct, indirect or contingent obligation that has a common bond where the aggregate exposure equals or exceeds a certain percentage of the Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 Capital plus the Allowance for Loan Losses. The MPS Credit Committee monitors and identifies the credit concentrations in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s concentration policy and evaluates the specific nature of each concentration to determine the potential risk to the Bank. An evaluation includes the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

A recommendation regarding additional controls needed to mitigate the concentration exposure. 

&#8226; 

A limitation or cap placed on the size of the concentration. 

&#8226; 

The potential necessity for increased capital and/or credit reserves to cover the increased risk caused by the concentration(s). 

&#8226; 

A strategy to reduce to acceptable levels those concentration(s) that are determined to create undue risk to the Bank. 

No MPS credit products were non-performing as of September 30, 2016 . 

&#160; 

Through its Refund Advantage division, MetaBank also provides short-term consumer refund advance loans. Taxpayers are underwritten to determine eligibility for the advances and the advances are unsecured. These consumer loans are interest-and fee free. Due to the nature of consumer advance loans, it typically takes no more than three e-file cycles to collect. In the event of default, MetaBank has no recourse with the tax consumer. Generally, when the refund advance loan becomes delinquent for 90 days or more, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful, the Company will charge off the loan balance. There were no taxpayer advances outstanding as of September 30, 2016; the Company expects this portfolio to expand significantly following its agreement with H&#38;R Block to offer such loans during the 2017 tax season. 

&#160; 

Commercial Operating Lending . The Company also originates commercial operating loans primarily in its market areas. Most of the Company&#8217;s commercial operating loans have been extended to finance local and regional businesses and include short-term loans to finance machinery and equipment purchases, inventory and accounts receivable. Commercial loans also may involve the extension of revolving credit for a combination of equipment acquisitions and working capital in expanding companies. At September 30, 2016 , $31.3 million , or 3.4% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total loans, were comprised of commercial operating loans. 

&#160; 

The maximum term for loans extended on machinery and equipment is based on the projected useful life of such machinery and equipment. Generally, the maximum term on non-mortgage lines of credit is one year. The loan-to-value ratio on such loans and lines of credit generally may not exceed 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. The Company&#8217;s commercial operating lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower&#8217;s character, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower&#8217;s capital and collateral as well as an evaluation of conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower&#8217;s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of the Company&#8217;s current credit analysis. Nonetheless, such loans are believed to carry higher credit risk than more traditional lending activities. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the average outstanding principal balance of a commercial operating loan held by the Company was approximately $0.1 million. 

&#160; 

Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial operating loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower&#8217;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial operating loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is likely to be dependent upon the general economic environment). The Company&#8217;s commercial operating loans are usually, but not always, secured by business assets and personal guarantees. However, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. At September 30, 2016 , none &#32;of the Company&#8217;s commercial operating loans were non-performing. 

Through its Refund Advantage division, MetaBank also provides short-term Electronic Return Originator ("EROs") advance loans on a nation-wide basis. These loans are typically utilized to purchase tax preparation software and to prepare tax offices for the upcoming season. EROs go through an underwriting process to determine eligibility for the advances and the advances are unsecured. Due to the nature of ERO advance loans, it typically takes no more than three e-file cycles to begin collection. Generally, when the ERO advance loan becomes delinquent for 90 days or more, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful, the Company will charge off the loan balance. There were no ERO advances outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 

Premium Finance Lending . Through its AFS/IBEX division, MetaBank provides short-term, primarily collateralized financing to facilitate the commercial customers&#8217; purchase of insurance for various forms of risk otherwise known as insurance premium financing primarily in California, Texas and Florida. This includes, but is not limited to, policies for commercial property, casualty and liability risk. The AFS/IBEX division markets itself to the insurance community as a competitive option based on service, its reputation, competitive terms, cost and ease of operation. At September 30, 2016 , $171.6 million , or 18.5% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total loans, were comprised of premium finance loans. 

&#160; 

Insurance premium financing is the business of extending credit to a policyholder to pay for insurance premiums when the insurance carrier requires payment in full at inception of coverage. Premiums are advanced either directly to the insurance carrier or through an intermediary/broker and repaid by the policyholder with interest during the policy term. The policyholder generally makes a 20% to 25% down payment to the insurance broker and finances the remainder over nine to ten months on average. The down payment is set such that if the policy is canceled, the unearned premium is typically sufficient to cover the loan balance and accrued interest. 

The largest premium finance exposure outstanding at September 30, 2016 , was a $3.7 million loan relationship secured by the related insurance policy of the borrower. At September 30, 2016 , the average outstanding principal balance of a premium finance loan held by the Company was approximately $7,900. 

&#160; 

Due to the nature of collateral for commercial premium finance receivables, it customarily takes 60-210 days to convert the collateral into cash. In the event of default, AFS/IBEX, by statute and contract, has the power to cancel the insurance policy and establish a first position lien on the unearned portion of the premium from the insurance carrier. In the event of cancellation, the cash returned in payment of the unearned premium by the insurer should typically be sufficient to cover the receivable balance, the interest and other charges due. Due to notification requirements and processing time by most insurance carriers, many receivables will become delinquent beyond 90 days while the insurer is processing the return of the unearned premium. Generally, when a premium finance loan becomes delinquent for 210 days or more, or when collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will charge off the loan balance and any remaining interest and fees after applying any collection from the insurance company. At September 30, 2016 , $1.0 million &#32;of the Company&#8217;s premium finance loans were non-performing. 

Originations, Sales and Servicing of Loans 

&#160; 

At the Retail Bank, loans are generally originated by the Company&#8217;s staff of loan officers. Loan applications are taken and processed in the branches and the main office of the Company. While the Company originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans, its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its market. Demand is affected by the interest rate and economic environment. 

&#160; 

The Company, from time to time, sells loan participations, generally without recourse. At September 30, 2016 , there were no loans outstanding sold with recourse. When loans are sold, the Company may retain &#160; the responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments, making certain that real estate tax payments are made on behalf of borrowers, and otherwise servicing the loans. The servicing fee is recognized as income over the life of the loans. The Company services loans that it originated and sold totaling $19.4 million &#32;at September 30, 2016 , of which $4.0 million &#32;were sold to Fannie Mae and $15.4 million were sold to others. 

On October 26, 2016, MetaBank entered into an agreement with certain H&#38;R Block entities to originate up to $1.45 billion and retain up to $750 million of interest-free refund advance loans for H&#38;R Block tax preparation customers during the 2017 tax season. 

&#160; 

In periods of economic uncertainty, the Company&#8217;s ability to originate large dollar volumes of loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in related loan origination fees, other fee income and operating earnings. In addition, the Company&#8217;s ability to sell loans may substantially decrease if potential buyers (principally government agencies) reduce their purchasing activities. 

The following table shows the loan originations (including draws, loan renewals, and undisbursed portions of loans in process), purchases, and sales and repayment activities of the Company for the periods indicated.

At September 30, 2016 , approximately $6.4 million, or 0.7%, of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio consisted of purchased loans. The Company believes that purchasing loans outside of its market area assists the Company in diversifying its portfolio and may lessen the adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business or operations which could result in the event of a downturn or weakening of the local economy in which the Company conducts its primary operations. However, additional risks are associated with purchasing loans outside of the Company&#8217;s market area, including the lack of knowledge of the local market and difficulty in monitoring and inspecting the property securing the loans. 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company&#8217;s purchased loans were secured by properties located, as a percentage of total loans, as follows: less than 1% combined in Oregon, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Connecticut. No loans were purchased in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern and Classified Assets 

&#160; 

When a borrower fails to make a required payment on real estate secured loans and consumer loans within 16 days after the payment is due, the Company generally initiates collection procedures by mailing a delinquency notice. The customer is contacted again, by written notice or telephone, before the payment is 30 days past due and again before 60 days past due. Generally, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if a loan has been delinquent for more than 90 days, satisfactory payment arrangements must be adhered to or the Company will initiate foreclosure or repossession. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s loan delinquencies by type, by amount and by percentage of type at September 30, 2016 .

&#160; 

Generally, when a loan becomes delinquent, 210 days or more for Premium Finance, or 90 days or more for all other loan categories, or when the collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will place the loan on a non-accrual status and, as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan is charged against current income. The loan will remain on a non-accrual status until six months of good payment history.

For the year ended September 30, 2016 , gross interest income that would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to approximately $2,000 , of which none was included in interest income. 

&#160; 

Non-Accruing Loans . At September 30, 2016 , the Company had $0.1 million &#32;in non-accruing loans, which constituted less than 0.1% of the Company's gross loan portfolio and total assets. At September 30, 2015 , the Company had $6.1 million &#32;in non-accruing loans which constituted 0.8% &#32;of its gross loan portfolio, or 0.2% &#32;of total assets. The fiscal 2016 &#32;decrease in non-performing loans primarily relates to a decrease in non-accruing loans in the agricultural operating category of $5.1 million , primarily due to the partial charge-off of a large agricultural relationship that has no remaining loan balance. 

&#160; 

Accruing Loans Delinquent 90 Days or More . At September 30, 2016 , the Company had $1.0 million &#32;in accruing premium finance loans delinquent 90 days or more. 

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by our primary regulator, the OCC, to be of lesser quality as &#8220;substandard,&#8221; &#8220;doubtful&#8221; or &#8220;loss.&#8221; An asset is considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. &#8220;Substandard&#8221; assets include those characterized by the &#8220;distinct possibility&#8221; that the Bank will sustain &#8220;some loss&#8221; if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified &#8220;substandard,&#8221; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make &#8220;collection or liquidation in full,&#8221; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, &#8220;highly questionable and improbable.&#8221; Assets classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; are those considered &#8220;uncollectible&#8221; and of such minimal value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 

&#160; 

General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When assets are classified as &#8220;loss,&#8221; the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. The Bank&#8217;s determinations as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances are subject to review by its regulatory authorities, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 

&#160; 

On the basis of management&#8217;s review of its classified assets, at September 30, 2016 , the Company had classified loans of $9.0 million &#32;as substandard and none as doubtful or loss. Further, at September 30, 2016 , the Bank had $76,101 in real estate owned or other foreclosed assets. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management&#8217;s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activity, including those loans which are being specifically monitored by management. Such evaluation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate loan loss allowance. 

&#160; 

Management closely monitors economic developments both regionally and nationwide, and considers these factors when assessing the appropriateness of its allowance for loan losses. The current economic environment continues to show signs of stability to improvement in the Bank&#8217;s markets. The Bank&#8217;s average loss rates over the past three years were low, offset with a higher agricultural loss rate in the current fiscal year driven by the charge off of one relationship. The Bank does not believe it is likely these low loss conditions will continue indefinitely. Management believes the low commodity prices and high land rents have the potential to negatively impact the economies of our agricultural markets. 

&#160; 

The allowance for loan losses established by MPS results from an estimation process that evaluates relevant characteristics of its credit portfolio. MPS also considers other internal and external environmental factors such as changes in operations or personnel and economic events that may affect the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are recorded periodically based on the result of this estimation process. 

Management believes that, based on a detailed review of the loan portfolio, historic loan losses, current economic conditions, the size of the loan portfolio and other factors, the current level of the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 , reflects an appropriate allowance against probable losses from the loan portfolio. Although the Company maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level it considers to be appropriate, investors and others are cautioned that there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts, or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods. In addition, the Company&#8217;s determination of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the OCC, which can require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances. 

&#160; 

Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure are recorded at fair value. If fair value at the date of foreclosure is lower than the balance of the related loan, the difference will be charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer. Valuations are periodically updated by management and, if the value declines, a specific provision for losses on such property is established by a charge to operations. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses.

Investment Activities 

&#160; 

General . The investment policy of the Company generally is to invest funds among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the Company&#8217;s need for liquidity, to achieve the proper balance between its desire to minimize risk and maximize yield, to provide collateral for borrowings and to fulfill the Company&#8217;s asset/liability management policies. The Company&#8217;s investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios are managed in accordance with a written investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors, which is implemented by members of the Company&#8217;s Investment Committee. The Company closely monitors balances in these accounts, and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid assets to fund potential deposit outflows or other liquidity needs. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant outflows related to MPS, though no assurance can be given that this will continue to be the case. 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016 , investment and mortgage-backed securities with fair values of approximately $824.5 million, $237.2 million and $9.2 million were pledged as collateral for the Bank&#8217;s Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) advances and collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase, respectively. For additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s collateralization of borrowings, see Notes 8 and 9 to the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#8221; which is included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Investment Securities . It is the Company&#8217;s general policy to purchase investment securities which are U.S. Government securities, U.S. Government agency and instrumentality securities, U.S. Government agency or instrumentality collateralized securities, state and local government obligations, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and overnight federal funds. 

Beginning in June 2012, the Company began executing a strategy designed to diversify the Bank&#8217;s investment securities portfolio. This strategy involved purchasing other investments, primarily non-bank qualified municipal bond securities. In fiscal 2016, the Company also executed upon relative value opportunities in the securities portfolio posed by perceived dislocations in the market by purchasing a sizable portion of government-related three-month Libor floating rate securities during the year. The Company believes diversification reduces the risk in the portfolio by spreading its investable dollars among a broader range of investment types and takes advantage of the Company&#8217;s innovative and low-cost funding structure. As of September 30, 2016 , the Company had total investment securities, excluding mortgage-backed securities, with an amortized cost of $1.37 billion &#32;compared to $953.0 million &#32;as of September 30, 2015 . At September 30, 2016 , $420.1 million, or 32.6%, of the Company&#8217;s investment securities were pledged to secure various obligations of the Company. 

A large portion of this investment strategy involves the purchase of non-bank qualified obligations of political subdivisions or municipal housing securities backed by or convertible into Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and or Ginnie Mae securities. These bonds are issued in larger denominations than bank qualified obligations of political subdivisions, which allows for the purchase of larger blocks. These larger blocks of municipal bonds are typically issued in larger denominations by well-known issuers with reputable reporting and in turn, tend to be more liquid, which helps reduce price risk. These municipal bonds are tax-exempt and as such have a tax equivalent yield higher than their book yield. The tax equivalent yield calculation uses the Company&#8217;s cost of funds as one of its components. Given the Company&#8217;s relatively low cost of funds due to the volume of interest-free deposits generated by the MPS division, the tax equivalent yield for these bonds is higher than a similar term investment in other investment categories. Many of the Company&#8217;s municipal holdings are able to be pledged at both the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank. 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016 , the Company had obligations of states and political subdivisions of $1.18 billion , representing 84.8% &#32;of total investment securities, excluding mortgage&#8209;backed securities. This amount is spread among 47 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, with no individual state (excluding agency backed and/or convertible municipal securities) having a concentration higher than 10% of the total carrying value of the municipal portfolio. The Company has no direct municipal bond exposure in Detroit or Puerto Rico. Management believes this geographical diversification lessens the credit risk associated with these investments. The Company also monitors concentrations of the ultimate borrower and exposure to counties within each state to further enhance proper diversification. 

The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s investment securities portfolio, excluding mortgage-backed securities and other Benefit Equalization Plan equity securities, at the dates indicated.

Mortgage-Backed Securities . The Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed and related securities portfolio consisted entirely of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or instrumentalities, including those of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as of September 30, 2016 . The Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certificates are modified pass&#8209;through mortgage-backed securities representing undivided interests in underlying pools of fixed&#8209;rate, or certain types of adjustable-rate, predominantly single-family and, to a lesser extent, multi&#8209;family residential mortgages issued by these U.S. Government agencies or instrumentalities. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company had a diverse portfolio of mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $688.8 million , all at fixed rates of interest. The Company held primarily seasoned 15-year, 20-year, and 30-year pass through mortgage-backed securities. Coupons on these securities ranged from below 3% to 5.5%. 

&#160; 

Mortgage-backed securities generally increase the quality of the Company&#8217;s assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans, and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the Company. At September 30, 2016 , $568.1 million or 81.9% of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed securities were pledged to secure various obligations of the Company. 

&#160; 

While mortgage-backed securities carry a reduced credit risk as compared to whole loans, such securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution and other underwriting risks inherent in the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of such mortgage loans and so affect both the prepayment speed, and value, of such securities. The prepayment risk associated with mortgage-backed securities is continually monitored, and prepayment rate assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to update the Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed securities accounting and asset/liability reports. 

The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed securities at the dates indicated.

At September 30, 2016 , the contractual maturity of all of the Company&#8217;s mortgage&#8209;backed securities was in excess of ten years. The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is typically less than its stated contractual maturity due to scheduled principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield to maturity. The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the mortgage-backed security. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans, which decrease and increase interest income, respectively. The prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of mortgage-backed securities, and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments. Although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon rate, borrower credit scores, loan to premises value, the age of mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates, the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security. Under such circumstances, the Company may be subject to reinvestment risk because, to the extent that the Company&#8217;s mortgage-backed securities amortize or prepay faster than anticipated, the Company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable rate. During periods of rising interest rates, these prepayments tend to decelerate as the prevailing market interest rates for mortgage rates increase and prepayment incentives dissipate. 

Management has implemented a process to identify securities with potential credit impairment that are other-than-temporary. This process involves evaluation of the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, review of available information regarding the financial position of the issuer, monitoring the rating, watch, and outlook of the security, monitoring changes in value, cash flow projections, and the Company&#8217;s intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity. To the extent we determine that a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. 

&#160; 

For all securities considered temporarily impaired, the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, which may occur at maturity. The Company believes it will collect all principal and interest due on all investments with amortized cost in excess of fair value and considered only temporarily impaired. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there were no other-than-temporary impairments recorded. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are both in conservatorship, generally provide the certificate holder a guarantee of timely payments of interest, whether or not collected. Ginnie Mae&#8217;s guarantee to the holder is timely payments of principal and interest, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 

&#160; 

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General . The Company&#8217;s sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, amortization and repayment of loan principal, interest earned on or maturation of investment securities and short-term investments, mortgage-backed securities and funds provided from operations.

Borrowings, including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements and funds available through the FRB Discount Window, may be used at times to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels, may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities, and may also be used to match the funding of a corresponding asset. 

&#160; 

Deposits . The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms. The Company&#8217;s deposits consist of statement savings accounts, money market savings accounts, NOW and regular checking accounts, deposits related to prepaid cards primarily categorized as checking accounts and certificate accounts currently ranging in terms from 3 months to 5 years. The Company solicits deposits from its primary market area and relies primarily on competitive pricing policies, advertising and high-quality customer service to attract and retain these deposits. 

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates, and competition. 

&#160; 

The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Company has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. The Company endeavors to manage the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives. Based on its experience, the Company believes that its savings, money market accounts, NOW, regular checking accounts and deposits related to prepaid cards are relatively stable sources of deposits. However, the ability of the Company to attract and maintain certificates of deposit and the rates paid on these deposits has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , $2.13 billion &#32;of the Company&#8217;s $2.43 billion &#32;deposit portfolio was attributable to MPS. The majority of these deposits represent funds available to spend on prepaid debit cards and other stored value products, of which $2.11 billion are included with non-interest-bearing checking accounts and $23.1 million are included with savings deposits on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Generally, these deposits do not pay interest. MPS originates debit card programs through outside sales agents and other financial institutions. As such, these deposits carry a somewhat higher degree of concentration risk than traditional consumer products. If a major client or card program were to leave the Bank, deposit outflows could be more significant than if the Bank were to lose a more traditional customer, although it is considered unlikely that all deposits related to a program would leave the Bank without significant advance notification. As such, and as historical results indicate and management believes, the Company&#8217;s deposit portfolio attributable to MPS is stable. The increase in deposits arising from MPS has allowed the Bank to reduce its reliance on higher costing certificates of deposits and public funds. See &#8220;Regulation &#8211; FDIC Deposit Classification Guidance.&#8221;

At September 30, 2016 , there were $77.2 million in deposits from governmental and other public entities included in certificates of deposit. 

&#160; 

Borrowings . Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funds, the Company&#8217;s practice has been to utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds, can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, or when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan demand. Borrowings from various sources mature based on stated payment schedules. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the FHLB upon the security of a blanket collateral agreement of a percentage of unencumbered loans and the pledge of specific investment securities. Such advances can be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. At September 30, 2016 , the Bank had $107.0 million &#32;of advances from the FHLB, $992.0 million &#32;of federal funds purchased and the ability to borrow up to an approximate additional $7.2 million. The Company is able to pledge additional assets to expand its borrowing capability at the FHLB. At September 30, 2016 , there were $7.0 million in advances that had maturities ranging up to approximately four years. 

&#160; 

The Company completed the public offering of $75 million of 5.75% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures during fiscal year 2016. These notes are due August 15, 2026. The subordinated debentures were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $73.9 million. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $73.2 million in subordinated debentures, net of issuance costs of $1.8 million. 

On July 16, 2001, the Company issued all of the 10,310 authorized shares of Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I (preferred securities of subsidiary trust) holding solely trust preferred securities. Distributions are paid semi&#8209;annually. Cumulative cash distributions are calculated at a variable rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) plus 3.75%, not to exceed 12.5%. The Company may, at one or more times, defer interest payments on the capital securities for up to 10 consecutive semi-annual periods, but not beyond July 25, 2031. At the end of any deferral period, all accumulated and unpaid distributions must be paid. The capital securities are required to be redeemed on July 25, 2031; however, the Company has a semi&#8209;annual option to shorten the maturity date. The option has not been exercised as of the date of this filing. The redemption price is $1,000 per capital security plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. Holders of the capital securities have no voting rights, are unsecured, and rank junior in priority of payment to all of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness and senior to the Company&#8217;s common stock. The trust preferred securities have been includable in the Company&#8217;s capital calculations since they were issued. The preferential capital treatment of the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities was grandfathered under recent banking legislation. 

From time to time, the Company has offered retail repurchase agreements to its customers. These agreements typically range from 14 days to five years in term, and typically have been offered in minimum amounts of $100,000. The proceeds of these transactions are used to meet cash flow needs of the Company. At September 30, 2016 , the Company had $3.0 million &#32;of retail repurchase agreements outstanding. 

The Company had three capital leases as of September 30, 2016, two equipment leases and one property lease. At September 30, 2016, the portion of the liability expected to be expensed and amortized over the next 12 months is $79,000, while the portion of the liability expected to be expensed and amortized beyond 12 months is $1.9 million. The majority of the $1.9 million is related to the Urbandale, Iowa retail branch locatio n. 

&#160;

Subsidiary Activities 

&#160; 

The subsidiaries of the Company are the Bank and First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I. 

&#160; 

Meta Payment Systems &#174; &#32;Division 

&#160; 

The Company, through the MPS division of the Bank, is focused on the electronic payments industry and offers a complement of prepaid cards, consumer credit products and other payment industry- related products and services that are marketed to consumers through financial institutions and other commercial entities on a nation-wide basis. The products and services offered by MPS are generally designed to facilitate the processing and settlement of authorized electronic transactions involving the movement of funds. MPS offers specific product solutions in the following areas: (i) prepaid cards, (ii) a consumer credit product, (iii) ATM sponsorship and (iv) tax refund transfers and, beginning in January 2017, interest-free tax refund loans. MPS&#8217; products and services generally target banks, card processors, third parties who market and distribute the cards and independent EROs. 

&#160; 

Each line of MPS&#8217; business is discussed generally below. With respect to the lines of business, there is a significant amount of cross-utilization of personnel and resources ( e.g. , a client asks MPS to develop products for both prepaid and consumer credit needs). 

&#160; 

Prepaid Cards . Prepaid cards take the form of credit card-sized plastics embedded with a magnetic stripe which encodes relevant card data (which may or may not include information about the user and/or purchaser of such card) or a &#8220;virtual&#8221; card where there is no actual plastic but the transaction and account records are handled in the same manner. When the holder of such a card attempts a permitted transaction, necessary information, including the authorization for such transaction, is shared between the &#8220;point of use&#8221; or &#8220;point of sale&#8221; and authorization systems maintaining the account of record. 

&#160; 

The funds associated with such cards are typically held in pooled accounts at the Bank representing the aggregate value of all cards issued in connection with particular products or programs, further described below. Although the funds are held in pooled accounts, the account of record indicates the funds held by each individual card. The cards may work in a closed loop ( e.g. , the card will only work at one particular merchant and will not work anywhere else), a semi-closed loop ( e.g. , the card will only work at a specific set of merchants such as a shopping mall), or in an open loop which function as a Visa, MasterCard, or Discover branded debit card that will work wherever such cards are accepted for payment. Most of MPS&#8217; prepaid cards are open-loop. 

&#160; 

This segment of MPS&#8217; business can generally be divided into three categories: reloadable cards, non-reloadable cards and benefit/insurance cards. These programs are typically offered via a third-party relationship. Government benefits are another growing application for prepaid cards; however, MPS has not focused on this category to date. 

&#160; 

Reloadable Cards . The most common reloadable prepaid card programs are payroll cards, whereby an employee&#8217;s payroll is loaded to the card by their employer utilizing direct deposit. General Purpose Reloadable (&#8220;GPR&#8221;) cards are usually distributed by retailers and can be reloaded an indefinite number of times at participating retail load networks. Other examples of reloadable cards are travel cards which are used to replace traveler&#8217;s checks and can be reloaded a predetermined number of times as well as tax-related cards where a taxpayer&#8217;s refund is placed on the card. Reloadable cards are generally open- loop cards that consumers can use to obtain cash at ATMs or purchase goods and services wherever such cards are accepted for payment. 

Non-Reloadable Cards . Non-reloadable prepaid cards are sometimes referred to as disposable and may only be used until the funds initially loaded to the card have been exhausted. These include gift cards, rebate cards and promotional or incentive cards. These cards may be closed-loop or open-loop but are generally not available to obtain cash. Under certain conditions, these cards may be anonymous, whereby no customer relationship is created and the identity of the cardholder is unknown. Except for gift cards, many non-reloadable card programs are funded by a corporation as a marketing tool rather than from consumer funds. 

&#160; 

Benefit/Insurance Cards . Benefit/insurance cards are traditionally used by employers and large commercial companies (such as property insurers) to distribute benefits to persons entitled to such funds. Possible uses of benefit cards could be the distribution of money for qualified expenses related to an employer sponsored flexible spending account program (&#8220;FSA&#8221;) or the distribution of insurance claim proceeds to insureds who have made a payable claim against an existing insurance policy. These cards are generally open-loop or semi-closed-loop as in the case of an FSA card that can only be used for qualified medical expenses. 

&#160; 

Consumer Credit Products . In its belief that credit programs can help meet legitimate credit needs for prime and sub-prime borrowers, and afford the Company an opportunity to diversify the loan portfolio and minimize earnings exposure due to economic downturns, the Company has offered certain credit programs that were designed to accomplish these objectives, although only one such program currently exists. 

&#160; 

MPS has strived to offer consumers innovative payment products, including credit products. Most credit products have historically fallen into one of two general categories: (1) sponsorship lending and (2) portfolio lending. In a sponsorship lending model, MPS typically originates loans and sells (without recourse) the resulting receivables to third-party investors equipped to take the associated credit risk. MPS&#8217; sponsorship lending program is governed by the Policy for Sponsorship Lending which has been approved by the Board of Directors. MPS discontinued most sponsorship lending programs in fiscal year 2012 with only one run-off portfolio still in existence. A Portfolio Credit Policy which has been approved by the Board of Directors governs portfolio credit initiatives undertaken by MPS, whereby the Company retains some or all receivables and relies on the borrower as the underlying source of repayment. 

&#160; 

ATM Sponsorship . MPS sponsors ATM independent sales organizations (&#8220;ISOs&#8221;) into various networks and provides associated sponsorships of encryption support organizations and third-party processors in support of the financial institutions and the ATM ISO sponsorships. Sponsorship consists of the review and oversight of entities participating in debit and credit networks. In certain instances, MPS also has certain leasehold interests in certain ATMs which require bank ownership and registration for compliance with applicable state law. 

&#160; 

While the Company has adopted policies and procedures to manage and monitor the risks attendant to this line of business, and the executives who manage the Company&#8217;s program have years of experience, no guarantee can be made that the Company will not experience losses in the MPS division. MPS has signed agreements through the next few years with several of its largest sales agents/program managers, which helps mitigate this risk. See &#8220;- Regulation &#8211; Proposal Prepaid Payments Regulation&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Tax Refund Transfers . With the acquisition of Refund Advantage in September 2015, the Company is a leading provider of professional tax refund-transfer software used by independent EROs in over 10,000 locations nationwide and processes over one million refund transfers per year. Refund Advantage offers tax refund-transfer solutions through ACH direct deposit, check and prepaid card. Beginning in January 2017, the Bank will offer 0% APR tax refund loans to consumers through marketing programs with national consumer tax preparation companies, including H&#38;R Block and MetaBank's own refund transfer companies, Refund Advantage and EPS. 

Regulation 

General 

The Company is broadly regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve, and is required to file reports with and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve applicable to such companies. As a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is also required to file reports with the SEC and otherwise comply with federal securities laws. The Bank is a federally chartered thrift institution that is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all of its operations by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC as deposit insurer. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; which is included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The legislative and regulatory enactments described below have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact upon the operations of the Company and the Bank. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;the Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) . In response to the national and international economic recession that began in 2007-2008 and to strengthen supervision of financial institutions and systemically important non-bank financial institutions, Congress and the U.S. Government took a variety of actions, including the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represented the most comprehensive change to banking laws since the Great Depression of the 1930s and mandated changes in several key areas: regulation and compliance (both with respect to financial institutions and systemically important non-bank financial companies), securities regulation, executive compensation, regulation of derivatives, corporate governance, transactions with affiliates, deposit insurance assessments and consumer protection. Importantly for the Bank, the Dodd-Frank Act also abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision (the &#8220;OTS&#8221;) on July 21, 2011, and transferred rulemaking authority and regulatory oversight to the OCC with respect to federal savings banks, such as the Bank, and to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with respect to savings and loan holding companies, such as the Company. While the changes in the law required by the Dodd-Frank Act have had a major impact on large institutions, even relatively smaller institutions such as ours have been affected. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;Bureau&#8221; or &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The Bureau has consolidated rules and orders with respect to consumer financial products and services and has substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, such as the Bank. The Bureau does not, however, examine or supervise the Bank for compliance with such regulations; rather, based on the Bank&#8217;s size (less than $10 billion in assets), enforcement authority remains with the OCC although the Bank may be required to submit reports or other materials to the Bureau upon its request. Notwithstanding jurisdictional limitations set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau and federal banking regulators may endeavor to work jointly in investigating and resolving cases as they arise. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions which restrict interchange fees to those which are &#8220;reasonable and proportionate&#8221; for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing (known as the &#8220;Durbin Amendment&#8221;). The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. In the final rule, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points to be eligible for a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; such that the fee is conclusively reasonable and proportionate. Another related rule also permits an additional $0.01 per transaction &#8220;fraud prevention adjustment&#8221; to the interchange fee if certain standards designed by the Federal Reserve are implemented including an annual review of fraud prevention policies and procedures. With respect to network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions, it is now required that all debit cards participate in at least two unaffiliated networks so that the transactions initiated using those debit cards will have at least two independent routing channels. Notably, the interchange fee restrictions in the Durbin Amendment do not apply to the Bank because debit card issuers with total worldwide assets of less than $10 billion are exempt. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also included a provision that supplements the Federal Trade Commission Act&#8217;s prohibitions against practices that are unfair or deceptive by also prohibiting practices that are &#8220;abusive.&#8221; The Bureau&#8217;s Director, Richard Cordray, has publicly stated that this term will not be defined by regulation but will, instead, be illuminated by the enforcement actions the Bureau initiates. To date, a relatively small number of Bureau enforcement actions have referenced alleged &#8220;abusive&#8221; acts or practices. 

&#160; 

The extent to which new legislation, existing and planned governmental initiatives, and a new presidential administration result in an improvement in the national economy is uncertain. In addition, because some components of the Dodd-Frank Act still have not been finalized, it is difficult to predict the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us or the Bank at this time, especially after the recent 2016 election. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act of 2001 . In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., which occurred on September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement&#8217;s and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The potential impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide-ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Among other provisions, the Patriot Act requires financial institutions to have anti-money laundering programs in place and requires banking regulators to consider a holding company&#8217;s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain merger or acquisition applications. 

&#160; 

Privacy . The Bank is required by statute and regulation to disclose its privacy policies to its customers on an annual basis. The Bank does not share nonpublic personal information about its customers with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. The Bank is also required to appropriately safeguard its customers&#8217; personal information. 

&#160; 

Preemption . On July 21, 2011, the preemption provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective, requiring that federal savings associations be subject to the same preemption standards as national banks, with respect to the application of state consumer laws to the interstate activities of federally chartered depository institutions. Under the preemption standards established under the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act for both national banks and federal savings associations, preemption of a state consumer financial law is permissible only if: (1) application of the state law would have a discriminatory effect on national banks or federal thrifts as compared to state banks; (2) the state law is preempted under a judicial standard that requires a state consumer financial law to prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of the national bank&#8217;s or federal thrift&#8217;s powers before it can be preempted, with such preemption determination being made by the OCC (by regulation or order) or by a court, in either case on a &#8220;case&#8209;by&#8209;case&#8221; basis; or (3) the state law is preempted by another provision of federal law other than Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act specifies that such preemption standards only apply to national banks and federal thrifts themselves, and not their non-depository institution subsidiaries or affiliates. Specifically, operating subsidiaries of national banks and federal thrifts that are not themselves chartered as a national bank or federal thrift may no longer benefit from federal preemption of state consumer financial laws, which now apply to such subsidiaries (or affiliates) to the same extent that they apply to any person, corporation or entity subject to such state laws. The Bank has no operating subsidiaries at present. 

Prohibition on Unfair, Deceptive and Abusive Acts and Practices . July 21, 2011 was the designated transfer date under the Dodd-Frank Act for the formal transfer of rulemaking functions under the federal consumer financial laws from each of the various federal banking agencies to the Bureau, which is charged with the mission of protecting consumer interests. The Bureau is responsible for administering and carrying out the purposes and objectives of the federal consumer financial laws and to prevent evasions thereof, with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The Bureau is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. With its broad rulemaking and enforcement powers coupled with a five-year operational history, the Bureau has redrawn the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement actions, which may directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank and its divisions. 

&#160; 

Prepaid Accounts under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth In Lending Act (Regulation Z) . &#32;&#32; On October 5, 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule which supplemented the existing regulatory framework pursuant to which prepaid products (both cards and other delivery methods, including codes) are offered and serviced. Importantly for the Bank, the rule brought prepaid products fully within Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act by adding a definition for &#8220;prepaid account&#8221;. In addition, prepaid products that have a credit component, like some of those offered in connection with an existing program manager agreement, are now regulated by Regulation Z, which implements the federal Truth in Lending Act. 

Pursuant to the Prepaid Accounts Rule, the CFPB requires that the consumer be presented with a new &#8220;Know Before You Owe&#8221; disclosure. Financial institutions, such as the Bank, must provide certain account information in a short form disclosure, in close proximity to the short-form disclosure, and in a long form disclosure to consumers before they acquire a prepaid account, unless specifically exempted. The rule generally extended Regulation E&#8217;s error resolution and limited liability requirements to all prepaid accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. In addition, the Prepaid Accounts Rule extended Regulation E&#8217;s three tiers of liability for unauthorized transfers to prepaid accounts, depending on when the consumer reported the error. The rule also extended Regulation E&#8217;s periodic statement requirement to prepaid accounts. Under the final rule, financial institutions must, at no additional charge or fee, provide prepaid account holders with (i) periodic account statements, or (ii) access to his or her account balance through a readily available telephone line and written and electronic records of the account history. The rule also extended Regulation Z&#8217;s credit card rules and disclosure requirements to prepaid accounts that provide overdraft services and other credit features. The rule also requires account issuers, such as the Bank, to post their publicly offered prepaid card program agreements on their websites, make them available to consumers upon request, and provide copies of all publicly offered prepaid card program agreements to the CFPB. The rule generally takes effect on October 1, 2017, with certain exceptions. It is likely that the Bank will incur additional costs to implement the rule. 

Customer Identification Programs for Holders of Prepaid Cards . On March 21, 2016, the federal banking agencies, including the OCC and the Federal Reserve, issued Interagency Guidance to Issuing Banks on Applying Customer Identification Program Requirements to Holders of Prepaid Cards . This guidance extends the requirements of the Customer Identification Program required by Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act to prepaid accounts where the cardholder has either the (i) ability to reload funds, or (ii) access to credit or overdraft features. If either of these features is present, the issuer must verify the identity of the named accountholder. 

Incentive-Based Compensation Restrictions. On June 10, 2016, the federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, issued a proposed rule related to incentive-based compensation (the original proposed rule was published in April 2011). A rule related to incentive-based compensation is required by Dodd-Frank. According to the banking agencies, the rule is intended to (1) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that the Agencies determine could encourage certain financial institutions to take inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss, (2) require the board of directors of those financial institutions to take certain oversight actions related to incentive-based compensation, and (3) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate Federal regulator. 

The banking regulators have tailored the requirements of the proposed rule to the size and complexity of the covered institution. As currently contemplated, the Company and the Bank would be Level 3 covered institutions under the proposal because both have an average total consolidated assets between $1 and $50 billion. As a Level 3 covered institution, the proposal subjects the Company and the Bank to only the basic set of prohibitions and requirements, which prohibit &#8220;excessive compensation, fees, or benefits&#8221; or any compensation agreement that &#8220;could lead to material financial loss.&#8221; 

The proposal also would require that the Company&#8217;s board of directors, or a committee thereof, conduct oversight of its incentive-based compensation program and approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers. Additionally, the Company and the Bank would be required to create and maintain records that document the structure of all of the incentive-based compensation arrangements, demonstrate compliance with the final rule, and disclose those records to the appropriate Federal regulator upon request. 

Examination Guidance for Third-Party Lending . On July 29, 2016, the FDIC issued revised examination guidance related to third-party lending relationships (e.g., lending arrangements that rely on a third party to perform a significant aspect of the lending process). Similar to guidance published by the OCC in 2013, these regulatory materials generally require that financial institutions ensure that risks related to such programs are evaluated, including the type of lending activity, the complexity of the lending program, the projected and realized volume created by the relationship, and the number of third-party lending relationships the institution has in place. 

Other Regulation . The Bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to its business operations including, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Military Lending Act, the Servicemembers&#8217; Civil Relief Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. As discussed below, any change in the regulations affecting the Bank&#8217;s operations is not predictable and could affect the Bank&#8217;s operations and profitability. 

Bank Supervision &#38; Regulation 

&#160; 

The Bank is a federally chartered thrift institution that is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all of its operations by its primary federal regulator, the OCC, and by its deposit insurer, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel. The Bank pays assessment fees both to the OCC and the FDIC, and the level of such assessments reflects the condition of the Bank. If the condition of the Bank were to deteriorate, the level of such assessments could increase significantly, having a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB System and is subject to certain limited regulation by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

Regulatory authorities have been granted extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities which are intended to strengthen the financial condition of the banking industry, including, but not limited to, the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Typically, these actions are undertaken due to violations of laws or regulations or conduct of operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. The OCC has announced that supervisory strategies for 2017 will focus on the following: (i) commercial and retail loan underwriting; (ii) business model sustainability and viability; (iii) operational resiliency; (iv) BSA/AML compliance management; and (v) change management processes to address new regulatory requirements. 

Any change in the nature of such regulation and oversight, such as the items mentioned above, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, or legislatively by Congress, could have a material impact on the Company or the Bank and their respective operations. The discussion herein of the regulatory and supervisory structure within which the Bank operates is general and does not purport to be exhaustive or a complete description of the laws and regulations involved in the Bank&#8217;s operations. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by the actual laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Federal Regulation of the Bank . As the primary federal regulator for federal savings associations, the OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federal savings associations, such as the Bank. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework for activities in which a federal savings association can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. 

&#160; 

In connection with its assumption of responsibility for the ongoing examination, supervision and regulation of federal savings associations, the OCC published a final rule on July 21, 2011, that republishes those OTS regulations that the OCC has the authority to promulgate and enforce as of the July 21, 2011 transfer date, with nomenclature and other technical amendments to reflect OCC supervision of federal savings associations. In addition, on May 17, 2012, November 20, 2013, and June 2, 2015, the OCC rescinded additional OTS documents that formerly applied to federal savings and loan associations, and applied new policy guidance where policy guidance did not already exist. With respect to the 2015 rules, the OCC streamlined requirements (where permitted) to provide integrated treatment to national banks and federal savings associations with respect to certain corporate activities and transactions. The new regulations define an &#8220;eligible savings association&#8221; as one that: (i) is well capitalized as defined in 12 CFR 6.4; (ii) Has a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (&#8220;CAMELS&#8221;); (iii) Has a Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq., rating of &#8216;&#8216;Outstanding&#8217;&#8217; or &#8216;&#8216;Satisfactory,&#8217;&#8217; if applicable; (iv) Has a consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Interagency Consumer Compliance Rating System; and (v) Is not subject to a cease and desist order, consent order, formal written agreement, or Prompt Corrective Action directive or, if subject to any such order, agreement, or directive, is informed in writing by the OCC that the savings association may be treated as an &#8216;&#8216;eligible bank or eligible savings association&#8217;&#8217; for purposes of the regulation. The OCC undertook this integration to promote fairness in supervision, reduce regulatory duplication and create efficiencies for national banks and federal savings associations, as well as the OCC. Additional proposed rules by the OCC related to the streamlining of the treatment by federal savings associations and national banks have also been issued, including proposals related to fidelity bonds and insider and affiliate lending. Once finalized, the OCC&#8217;s regulations and guidance supersede that of OTS and are indicative of the OCC&#8217;s goal of one integrated policy platform for national banks and savings associations. 

It is possible that additional rulemaking could require significant revisions to the regulations under which the Bank operates and is supervised. Any change in such laws and regulations or interpretations thereof negatively impacting the Bank's or the Company's current operations, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Bureau, the Federal Reserve or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations and on the Company and its stockholders. 

&#160; 

Business Activities 

&#160; 

The activities of federal savings associations are generally governed by federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the activities in which federal savings associations may engage. In particular, many types of lending authority for federal savings associations are limited to a specified percentage of the institution&#8217;s capital or assets. 

&#160; 

Loan and Investment Powers 

&#160; 

The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act (&#8220;HOLA&#8221;) and the OCC&#8217;s implementing regulations thereunder. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. The Bank may also establish service corporations that are permitted to engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities; provided, however, that such investments are limited to 3% of the association's assets. These investment powers are subject to various limitations, including (i) a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security unless, prior to acquisition, the savings association has determined that the investment is safe and sound and suitable for the institution and that the issuer has adequate resources and willingness to provide all required payments on its obligations in a timely manner; (ii) a limit of 400% of an association&#8217;s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non-residential real estate property; (iii) a limit of 20% of an association&#8217;s assets on the aggregate amount of commercial and agricultural loans and leases with the amount of commercial loans in excess of 10% of assets being limited to small business loans; (iv) a limit of 35% of an association&#8217;s assets on the aggregate amount of secured consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities, with amounts in excess of 30% of assets being limited to loans made directly to the original obligor and where no third-party finder or referral fees were paid; (v) a limit of 5% of assets on non-conforming loans (loans in excess of the specific limitations of the HOLA); and (vi) a limit of the greater of 5% of assets or an association&#8217;s capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property. In addition, the HOLA and the OCC regulations provide that a federal savings association may invest up to 10% of its assets in tangible personal property for leasing purposes. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s general permissible lending limit to one borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus). At September 30, 2016 , the Bank&#8217;s lending limit under these restrictions was $49.5 million. The Bank is in compliance with this lending limit. 

Federal Deposit Insurance and Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC . The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. While not our primary federal regulator, the FDIC as insurer imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has authority to initiate enforcement actions against any FDIC-insured institution after giving its primary federal regulator the opportunity to take such action, and may seek to terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to $250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. The Dodd-Frank Act also set a new minimum DIF reserve ratio at 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is required to attain this ratio by September 30, 2020. In connection with this requirement, in November 2015, the FDIC released a proposed rulemaking (1) raising the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%; (2) requiring that the reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020; and (3) requiring that the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, like the Bank. The Board of the FDIC voted to increase the reserve ratio to 1.35% in October 2015. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% on June 30, 2016 and it is anticipated to reach the statutory mandate of 1.35% in 2018. 

The FDIC imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance. Pursuant to changes adopted by the FDIC that were effective July 1, 2016, in connection with the achievement of a 1.15% reserve ratio, the initial base rate for deposit insurance is between 3-30 basis points. Total base assessment after possible adjustments now ranges between 1.5-40.0 basis points. For established smaller institutions, like the Bank, CAMELS composite ratings are used along with (i) an initial base assessment rate, (ii) an unsecured debt adjustment (can be positive or negative), and (iii) a brokered deposit adjustment rate, to calculate a total base assessment rate. Note that the final rule states that it is &#8220;revenue neutral&#8221; in that it leaves aggregate assessment revenue collected from small banks approximately as it would have been absent the final rule. Risk categorization for purposes of deposit insurance are no longer utilized. 

As noted above, brokered deposits are subject to an adjustment rate in the calculation of deposit insurance premiums. Based upon guidance issued by the FDIC, some of Meta&#8217;s prepaid deposits would be deemed to be &#8220;brokered&#8221; deposits. As discussed below, should the Bank fail to maintain its well capitalized status, limitations related to brokered deposits would automatically trigger which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Company. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the OCC. Management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

A significant increase in DIF insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. 

&#160; 

DIF-insured institutions pay a Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. At September 30, 2016 , the FICO assessment was equal to 0.56 basis points for each $100 of its total assessment base of approximately $2.80 billion. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019. 

&#160; 

Interest Rate Risk Management . The OCC requires federal savings banks, like the Bank, to have an effective and sound interest rate risk management program, including appropriate measurement and reporting, robust and meaningful stress testing, assumption development reflecting the institution&#8217;s experience, and comprehensive model valuation. Interest rate risk exposure is supposed to be managed using processes and systems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels; complexity; business model; risk profile; and scope of operations. As of March 31, 2012, federal savings banks are required to have an independent interest rate risk management process in place that measures both earnings and capital at risk. 

&#160; 

Stress Testing . Although the Dodd-Frank Act requires institutions with more than $10 billion in assets to conduct stress testing, the OCC expects every bank, regardless of its size or risk profile, to have an effective internal process to (1) assess its capital adequacy in relation to its overall risks at least annually, and (2) to plan for maintaining appropriate capital levels. It is the OCC&#8217;s belief that stress testing permits community banks to identify their key vulnerabilities to market forces and assess how to effectively manage those risks should they emerge. If stress testing results indicate that capital ratios could fall below the level needed to adequately support the bank&#8217;s overall risk profile, the OCC believes the bank&#8217;s board and management should take appropriate steps to protect the bank from such an occurrence, including establishing a plan that requires closer monitoring of market information, adjusting strategic and capital plans to mitigate risk, changing risk appetite and risk tolerance levels, limiting or stopping loan growth or adjusting the portfolio mix, adjusting underwriting standards, raising more capital and selling or hedging loans to reduce the potential impact from such stress events. 

&#160; 

Assessments . The Dodd-Frank Act provides that, in establishing the amount of an assessment, the Comptroller of the Currency may consider the nature and scope of the activities of the entity, the amount and type of assets it holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity and any other factor that is appropriate. The Bank&#8217;s assessment (standard assessment) at September 30, 2016 , was $297,540. 

Basel III Capital Requirements. &#160; 2016 is the second year of implementation of the bank capital rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) adopted in July 2013 by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, the OCC. The Basel III Capital Rules established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially increased the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including us and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. 

The Basel III Capital Rules established three components of regulatory capital: (1) common equity tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1 Capital&#8221;), (2) additional tier 1 capital, and (3) tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 and additional tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements. Total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of additional tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. CET1, tier 1 capital, and total capital serve as the numerators for three prescribed regulatory capital ratios. Risk-weighted assets, calculated using the standardized approach in the Basel III Capital Rules for us and the Bank, provide the denominator for such ratios. There is also a leverage ratio that compares tier 1 capital to average total assets. 

Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements set by the Basel III Capital Rules could result in certain mandatory and/or discretionary disciplinary actions by our regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position. Under the capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our Company and Bank&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

Beginning January 1, 2016, we and the Bank became required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of CET1 Capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. On January 1, 2016, our Company and Bank complied with the capital conservation buffer requirement, which increased the minimum requirement of the three risk-based capital ratios by 0.625% each year through 2019, at which point, the CET1 Capital risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios will be 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 Capital. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 Capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1 Capital. See Note 13 to the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#8221; which is included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items are not excluded; however, &#8220;non-advanced approaches banking organizations,&#8221; including us and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. This election was made concurrently with the first filing of certain of our and the Bank&#8217;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015 in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, from inclusion in our Tier 1 capital, subject to grandfathering in the case of companies, such as us, that had less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 Capital began on January 1, 2015, and are being phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules apply to and revised the &#8220;PCA&#8221; regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i) introducing a CET1 Capital ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 Capital ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a large and risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in high-risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

As of September 30, 2016 , the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements as showing in the table below and was designated as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under federal guidelines. The table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity. See Note 13 to the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#8221; which is included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capital ratios were determined using the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015. Among other changes, the Basel III Capital Rules revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum CET1 Capital ratio; those changes are being fully phased in through the end of 2019. 

Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. Effective December 19, 1992, (and revised as described above) the federal banking agencies were given additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. Under the current regulations, an institution is deemed to be (a) &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, has a CET1 risk based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, and has leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and is not subject to any order or final capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (b) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of 4.5% or more and has a leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more (3.0% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of well-capitalized; (c) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0%; (d) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3% or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0%; and (e) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. In certain situations, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if the institution were in the next lower category. 

The federal banking agencies are generally required to take action to restrict the activities of an &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; bank. Any such bank must submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by the parent holding company and such holding company has provided appropriate assurances of performances. Until such plan is approved, it may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions. The banking regulators are authorized to impose additional restrictions, discussed below, that are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. 

&#160; 

Adequately capitalized banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave them undercapitalized; they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, they would be undercapitalized; and they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless they have applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC. The FDIC has defined the &#8220;national rate&#8221; for all interest-bearing deposits held by less-than-well-capitalized institutions as &#8220;a simple average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available&#8221; and has stated that its presumption is that this national rate is the prevailing rate in any market. As such, less-than-well-capitalized institutions that are permitted to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits via FDIC waiver generally may not pay an interest rate in excess of the national rate plus 75 basis points on such brokered deposits. 

&#160; 

Undercapitalized banks may not accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits, and are subject to restrictions on the soliciting of deposits over prevailing rates. In addition, undercapitalized banks are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. These restrictions include, among others, that such a bank generally may not make any capital distributions, must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the FDIC, may not increase its average total assets during a calendar quarter in excess of its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter unless any increase in total assets is consistent with a capital restoration plan approved by the FDIC and the bank&#8217;s ratio of equity to total assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the bank to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. In addition, such banks may not acquire a business, establish or acquire a branch office or engage in a new line of business without regulatory approval. Further, as part of a capital restoration plan, the bank&#8217;s holding company must generally guarantee that the bank will return to adequately capitalized status and provide appropriate assurances of performance of that guarantee. If a capital restoration plan is not approved, or if the bank fails to implement the plan in any material respect, the bank would be treated as if it were &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; which would result in the imposition of a number of additional requirements and restrictions. It should also be noted all FDIC-insured institutions are assigned an assessment risk category. In general, weaker banks (those with a higher assessment risk category) are subject to higher assessments than stronger banks. An adverse change in category can lead to materially higher expenses for insured institutions. Finally, bank regulatory agencies have the ability to seek to impose higher than normal capital requirements known as individual minimum capital requirements (&#8220;IMCR&#8221;) for institutions with higher risk profiles. If the Bank&#8217;s capital status &#8211; well-capitalized &#8211; changes as a result of future operations or regulatory order, or if it becomes subject to an IMCR, the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Any institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; ( i.e. , Tier 1 risk-based ratio of less than 4% or CET1 risk-based or core capital ratios of less than 3% or a risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%) must be made subject to one or more of additional specified actions and operating restrictions mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;). These actions and restrictions include requiring the issuance of additional voting securities; limitations on asset growth; mandated asset reduction; changes in senior management; divestiture, merger or acquisition of the association; restrictions on executive compensation; and any other action the OCC deems appropriate. An institution that becomes &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; is subject to further mandatory restrictions on its activities in addition to those applicable to significantly undercapitalized associations. In addition, the appropriate banking regulator must appoint a receiver (or conservator with the FDIC&#8217;s concurrence) for an institution, with certain limited exceptions, within 90 days after it becomes critically undercapitalized. Any undercapitalized institution is also subject to other possible enforcement actions, including the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The appropriate regulator is also generally authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

&#160; 

The imposition of any of these measures on the Bank may have a substantial adverse effect on it and on the Company&#8217;s operations and profitability. Meta Financial stockholders do not have preemptive rights and, therefore, if Meta Financial is directed by its regulators to issue additional shares of common stock, such issuance may result in the dilution in stockholders&#8217; percentage of ownership of Meta Financial. 

&#160; 

Institutions in Troubled Condition . Certain events, including entering into a formal written agreement with a bank&#8217;s regulator that requires action to improve the bank&#8217;s financial condition, or simply being informed by the regulator that the bank is in troubled condition, will automatically result in limitations on so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; agreements pursuant to Section 18(K) of the FDIA. In addition, organizations that are not in compliance with minimum capital requirements, or are otherwise in a troubled condition, must give 90 days&#8217; written notice before appointing a Director or Senior Executive Officer, pursuant to the OCC&#8217;s regulations. 

&#160; 

Branching by Federal Savings Associations . Subject to certain limitations, the HOLA and the OCC regulations permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state of the United States. The authority to establish such branches is available if the law of the state in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the savings association were a state savings association chartered by such state or if the association qualifies as a &#8220;domestic building and loan association&#8221; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which imposes qualification requirements similar to those for a &#8220;qualified thrift lender&#8221; under the HOLA. See &#8220;&#8212; Qualified Thrift Lender Test .&#8221; The branching authority under the HOLA and the OCC regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations. 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness . The guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions. The operational and managerial standards in the guidelines generally relate to the following: (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) compensation, fees and benefits; (8) asset quality; and (9) earnings. Again, rather than providing specific rules, the guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution. Failure to meet the standards in the guidelines, however, could result in a request by the OCC to the Bank to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines. 

Civil Money Penalties. &#32;&#32;The OCC has the authority to assess civil money penalties (&#8220;CMPs&#8221;) against any national bank, federal savings bank or any of their institution-affiliated parties (&#8220;IAP&#8221;). In addition, the OCC has the authority to assess CMPs against bank service companies and service providers. CMPs may encourage an affected party to correct violations, unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duty. CMPs also serve as a deterrent to future violations of law, regulation, orders and other conditions. When determining CMP amounts, the OCC is required by statute to consider the following four factors: (1) the size and financial resources and good faith of the institution or IAP charged; (2) the gravity of the violation; (3) the history of previous violations; and (4) such other matters as justice may require. In addition to these factors there are other factors that the FFIEC has adopted that banking agencies should consider. If the Bank, the Company or any of its IAPs were to have CMPs imposed, such penalties could be material. 

Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions . Federal regulations govern the permissibility of capital distributions by a federal savings association. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings associations that are part of a savings and loan holding company structure must now file a notice of a declaration of a dividend with the Federal Reserve at least 30 days before the proposed dividend declaration by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors. In the case of cash dividends, OCC regulations require that federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of a stock savings and loan holding company must file an informational copy of that notice with the OCC at the same time the notice is filed with the Federal Reserve. OCC regulations further set forth the circumstances under which a federal savings association is required to submit an application or notice before it may make a capital distribution. 

&#160; 

A federal savings association proposing to make a capital distribution is required to submit an application to the OCC if: the association does not qualify for expedited treatment pursuant to criteria set forth in OCC regulations; the total amount of all of the association&#8217;s capital distributions (including the proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds the association&#8217;s net income for that year to date plus the association&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years; the association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; or the proposed capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute, regulation or agreement between the association and the OCC or the Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s former regulator, the OTS, or violate a condition imposed on the association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS. 

&#160; 

A federal savings association proposing to make a capital distribution is required to submit a prior notice to the OCC if: the association would not be well-capitalized following the distribution; the proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the association&#8217;s common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or subordinate debentures included in the association&#8217;s capital (other than regular payments required under a debt instrument); or the association is a subsidiary of a federally chartered mutual savings and loan holding company; however, where a savings association subsidiary of a stock savings and loan holding company is proposing to pay a cash dividend that does not require an application or a notice filing, only an informational filing is required. 

&#160; 

Each of the Federal Reserve and OCC have primary reviewing responsibility for the applications or notices required to be submitted to them by savings associations relating to a proposed distribution. The Federal Reserve may disapprove of a notice, and the OCC may disapprove of a notice or deny an application, if: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the savings association would be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized following the distribution; 

&#8226; 

the proposed distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 

&#8226; 

the proposed distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement between the savings association (or its holding company, in the case of the Federal Reserve) and the entity&#8217;s primary federal regulator, or a condition imposed on the savings association (or its holding company, in the case of the Federal Reserve) in an application or notice approved by the entity&#8217;s primary federal regulator. 

Under current regulations, the Bank is not permitted to pay dividends on its stock if its regulatory capital would fall below the amount required for the liquidation account established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the Bank to qualifying depositors at March 31, 1992, who continue to maintain deposits at the Bank after its conversion from a federal mutual savings and loan association to a federal stock savings bank pursuant to its Plan of Conversion adopted August 21, 1991. 

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 , the Bank paid no cash dividends to the Company, as the Company utilized existing cash holdings for payment of dividends to the Company&#8217;s stockholders and other holding company expenses. The Company does not currently anticipate that it will need dividends from the Bank in order to fund dividends to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. To declare a dividend under new rules adopted in 2015 by the OCC, an institution must file a notice with the OCC as an &#8220;eligible savings association&#8221; (as defined in the OCC&#8217;s regulations) if, among other things, it would not remain well-capitalized or would not be an eligible savings association upon the distribution. An application to the OCC is required prior to a capital distribution if, among other things, a federal savings association is not an &#8220;eligible savings association.&#8221; If neither of these are triggered, an institution &#160; does not need to file a notice or an application before declaring a dividend or otherwise making a capital distribution. 

&#160; 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . All savings associations, including the Bank, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender (&#8220;QTL&#8221;) test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. This test requires a savings association to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets (as defined by regulation) in qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities) on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis or meet the requirements for a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code. Under either test, the required assets primarily consist of residential housing related to loans and investments. At September 30, 2016 , the Bank met the test and always has since its inception. 

&#160; 

Any savings association that fails to meet the QTL test must convert to a national bank charter, unless it qualifies as a QTL within one year and thereafter remains a QTL, or limits its new investments and activities to those permissible for both a savings association and a national bank. In addition, the association is subject to national bank limits for payment of dividends and branching authority. If such association has not requalified or converted to a national bank within three years after the failure, it must divest all investments and cease all activities not permissible for a national bank. The Bank currently meets its QTL requirement and expects to do so for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), the Bank is evaluated periodically by its primary federal banking regulator to determine if it is meeting its continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its assessment areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Bank received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating during its most recent Performance Evaluation as an Intermediate Small Bank, dated October 16, 2013. Due to its asset size, the Bank will be evaluated as a Large Bank in future CRA performance evaluations. A copy of the Bank&#8217;s most recent Performance Evaluation is available as part of its Public File. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule. &#160; On December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including our primary federal regulators the Federal Reserve and the OCC, adopted final rules implementing the so-called Volcker Rule embodied in Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;). The final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Community and small banks, such as MetaBank, are afforded some relief under the final rules. If such banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. Government, agency, state and municipal obligations, they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community or small bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures. The compliance date for banks to conform to the Volcker Rule was July 21, 2015, but the regulators have granted multiple extensions until July 21, 2017 for conformance of relationships with covered funds that existed prior to December 31, 2013 (in granting this last extension, the Federal Reserve noted that this is the final extension that will be granted in connection with such "legacy" covered funds). Beginning June 30, 2014, banking entities with $50 billion or more in trading assets and liabilities were required to report quantitative metrics; on April 30, 2016, banking entities with at least $25 billion but less than $50 billion must report; and on December 31, 2016, banking entities with at least $10 billion but less than $25 billion must report. The Company does not at this time expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on its operations. 

Interstate Banking and Branching . The FRB may approve an application of an adequately capitalized and adequately managed savings and loan holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank or savings association located in a state other than such holding company&#8217;s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. In general, the FRB may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state or if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank&#8217;s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies are also generally authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches or the establishment of a new branch is permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. South Dakota permits interstate branching only by merger. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates . The Bank must comply with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act relative to transactions with &#8220;affiliates,&#8221; generally defined to mean any company that controls or is under common control with the institution (as such, Meta Financial is an affiliate of the Bank for these purposes). Transactions between an institution or its subsidiaries and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the Bank as terms prevailing at the time for transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the institutions&#8217; capital ( e.g. , the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the institution; the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the institution&#8217;s capital and surplus). In addition, a savings and loan holding company may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a savings and loan holding company or acquire the securities of most affiliates. The OCC has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of savings institutions as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also included specific changes to the law related to the definition of &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; in Sections 23A and 23B and limitations on asset purchases from insiders. With respect to the definition of &#8220;covered transaction,&#8221; the Dodd-Frank Act now defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank&#8217;s loan or extension of credit to another person or company. In addition, a &#8220;derivative transaction&#8221; with an affiliate is now deemed to be a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate. A separate provision of the Dodd-Frank Act states that an insured depository institution may not &#8220;purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to&#8221; a bank insider (or their related interests) unless (1) the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties, and (2) if the proposed transaction represents more than 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution, it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution&#8217;s non-interested directors. 

Certain transactions with directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations. These conflict of interest regulations and other statutes also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests. Among other things, such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the Bank. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, one of 11 regional FHLBs that administers the home financing credit function of savings associations that is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances must be used for residential home financing. 

&#160; 

As members of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain activity-based capital stock in the FHLB in the amount specified by the applicable Federal Home Loan Bank's capital plan. At September 30, 2016 , the Bank had in the aggregate $47.5 million &#32;in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines' requirement. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 , dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $571,819. In June 2015, the FHLB of Des Moines and the FHLB of Seattle merged into the FHLB of Des Moines. Notably, pursuant to certain integration rules adopted by the OCC in 2015, federal savings associations are no longer required to become members of a Federal Home Loan Bank. 

&#160; 

Under federal law, the FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank&#8217;s FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, the federal agency that regulates the FHLBs has required each FHLB to register its stock with the SEC, which has increased the costs of each FHLB and may have other effects that are not possible to predict at this time. 

&#160; 

Federal Securities Law . The common stock of Meta Financial is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, as amended. Meta Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

Meta Financial&#8217;s stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If Meta Financial meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company, subject to certain requirements, will be able to sell, in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 

&#160; 

FDIC Deposit Classification Guidance 

&#160; 

On January 5, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) published initial industry guidance (the &#8220;Guidance&#8221;) in the form of Frequently Asked Questions with respect to the categorization of deposit liabilities as "brokered" deposits. This guidance was later supplemented on November 13, 2015, and was finalized on June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 , the Bank categorized $1.48 billion, or 63.2% of its deposit liabilities, as brokered deposits . 

&#160; 

Due to the Bank&#8217;s status as a "well-capitalized" institution under the new Basel III Capital Rules, and further with respect to the Bank&#8217;s financial condition in general, the Company does not at this time anticipate that the Guidance will have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, statements of financial condition or results of operations going forward. However, should the Bank ever fail to be well-capitalized in the future as a result of not meeting the well-capitalized requirements or the imposition of an individual minimum capital requirement or a similar formal requirement, then, notwithstanding that the Bank has capital in excess of the well-capitalized minimum requirements, the Bank would be prohibited, absent waiver from the FDIC, from utilizing brokered deposits ( i.e., &#32;no insured depository institution that is deemed to be less than &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; may accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC). In such event, unless the Bank were to receive a suitable waiver from the FDIC, such a result could produce serious material adverse consequences for the Bank with respect to liquidity and could also have serious material adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. Further, and in general, depending on the Bank&#8217;s condition in the future, the FDIC could increase the surcharge on our brokered deposits up to thirty basis points. The Company will monitor any future clarifications, rulings and interpretations, including whether institutions would be expected by the FDIC to amend prior call reports. If we are required to amend previous call reports with respect to our level of brokered deposits, which the Company does not expect, or we are ever required to pay higher surcharge assessments with respect to these deposits, such payments could be material and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Holding Company Supervision &#38; Regulation 

&#160; 

We are a registered unitary savings and loan holding company, and as such we are subject to Federal Reserve examination, supervision, and certain reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over us and any of our non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings association. 

The Federal Reserve has responsibility for the primary supervision and regulation of all savings and loan holding companies, including the Company. In connection with its assumption of responsibility for the ongoing examination, supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies, the Federal Reserve has published an interim final rule (&#8220;Regulation LL&#8221;, which, as of the date of this filing, has still not been adopted in final form) that provides for the corresponding transfer from the OTS to the Federal Reserve of the regulations necessary for the Federal Reserve to administer the statutes governing savings and loan holding companies. Related to this authority, the Federal Reserve issued on November 7, 2014, a list identifying the supervisory guidance documents issued by it prior to July 21, 2011 that are now applicable to savings and loan holding companies such as the Company. The FRB stated that, among other things, this list was part of their initiative to establish a savings and loan holding company supervisory program similar in nature to its &#8220;long-established supervisory program for bank holding companies.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Restrictions Applicable to All Savings and Loan Holding Companies. 

&#160; 

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including us, directly or indirectly, from acquiring: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

control (as defined under the HOLA) of another savings institution (or a holding company parent) without prior Federal Reserve approval; 

&#8226; 

through merger, consolidation or purchase of assets another savings institution or a holding company thereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company) without prior Federal Reserve approval; or 

&#8226; 

control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC (except through a merger with and into the holding company&#8217;s savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the Federal Reserve). 

A savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an FDIC-insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located, except: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the FDIC; 

&#8226; 

if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of March 5, 1987; or 

&#8226; 

if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located, or by a holding company that controls such a state-chartered association. 

The HOLA also prohibits a savings and loan holding company (directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries) from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of the voting shares of a non&#8209;subsidiary savings association, a non-subsidiary holding company or a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 

&#160; 

Failure to Meet QTL Test. 

&#160; 

If a banking subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company fails to meet the QTL test, the holding company must register with the FRB as a bank holding company within one year of the savings institution&#8217;s failure to comply. 

&#160; 

Activities Restrictions. 

&#160; 

Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies were generally permitted to engage in a wider array of activities than those permissible for their bank holding company counterparts and could have concentrations in real estate lending that are not typical for bank holding companies. Section 606 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the HOLA and requires that covered savings and loan holding companies ( e.g. , those that are not exempt from activities restrictions under the HOLA) that intend to engage in activities that are permissible only for a financial holding company under Section 4(k) of the BHCA do so only if the covered company meets all of the criteria to qualify as a financial holding company, and complies with all of the requirements applicable to a financial holding company as if the covered savings and loan holding company was a bank holding company. Savings and loan holding companies engaging in new Section 4(k) activities permissible for bank holding companies will need to comply with notice and filing requirements of the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

If the Federal Reserve believes that an activity of a savings and loan holding company or a non-bank subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings association and is inconsistent with the principles of sound banking, the purposes of the HOLA or other applicable statutes, the Federal Reserve may require the savings and loan holding company to terminate the activity or divest control of the non-banking subsidiary. This obligation is established in Section 10(g)(5) of the HOLA and bank holding companies are subject to equivalent obligations under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. 

Source of Strength and Capital Requirements. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including savings and loan holding companies, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary savings associations; to date, however, specific regulations implementing this requirement have not been published. Moreover, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies are generally subject to the same capital and activity requirements as those applicable to bank holding companies. 

&#160; 

New rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve related to capital requirements that were required by the Dodd-Frank Act have also become effective. For a summary of the applicable changes, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Industry and Business.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Examination. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends, to the greatest extent possible, taking into account any unique characteristics of savings and loan holding companies and the requirements of the HOLA, to assess the condition, performance and activities of savings and loan holding companies on a consolidated basis in a manner that is consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s established risk-based approach regarding bank holding company supervision. As with bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s objective will be to ensure that a savings and loan holding company and its non-depository subsidiaries are effectively supervised and can serve as a source of strength for, and do not threaten the soundness of, its subsidiary depository institution(s). 

&#160; 

In accordance with its goal to assess the condition, performance and activities of savings and loan holding companies on a consolidated basis in a manner that is consistent with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s established risk-based approach regarding bank holding company supervision, the Federal Reserve announced in 2013 that it will continue to use &#8220;RFI/C(D)&#8221; rating system (commonly referred to as &#8220;RFI&#8221;) to assign indicative ratings to such companies. Further, on November 7, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it will soon issue a notice seeking public comment on the application of the RFI rating system for Savings and Loan Holding Companies. In addition, in late 2013, the Federal Reserve announced that, with respect to savings and loan holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets (like the Company), such companies&#8217; inspection frequency and scope requirements will be the same as those for bank holding companies of the same asset size. The FRB will also determine whether or not a savings and loan holding company is &#8220;complex&#8221; as determined by certain factors enumerated by the Federal Reserve. According to the Federal Reserve, with respect to institutions with less than $10 billion in assets (such as the Company), the determination of whether a holding company is "complex" versus "noncomplex" is made at least annually on a case-by-case basis taking into account and weighing a number of considerations, such as: the size and structure of the holding company; the extent of intercompany transactions between insured depository institution subsidiaries and the holding company or uninsured subsidiaries of the holding company; the nature and scale of any non-bank activities, including whether the activities are subject to review by another regulator and the extent to which the holding company is conducting Gramm-Leach-Bliley authorized activities ( e.g. , insurance, securities, merchant banking); whether risk management processes for the holding company are consolidated; and whether the holding company has material debt outstanding to the public. As of the date of this filing, the FRB has not advised the Company that it is complex. 

&#160; 

Change of Control. 

&#160; 

The federal banking laws require that appropriate regulatory approvals must be obtained before an individual or company may take actions to &#8220;control&#8221; a bank or savings association. The definition of control found in the HOLA is similar to that found in the BHCA for bank holding companies. Both statutes apply a similar three-prong test for determining when a company controls a bank or savings association. Specifically, a company has control over either a bank or savings association if the company: 

(1) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of a company; 

(2) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors (or any individual who performs similar functions in respect of any company, including a trustee under a trust) of the board; or 

(3) directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank. 

Regulation LL, the interim final rule discussed above, implements the HOLA to govern the operations of savings and loan holding companies. Regulation LL includes a specific definition of &#8220;control&#8221; similar to the statutory definition, with certain additional provisions. Additionally, Regulation LL modifies the regulations previously used by the OTS for purposes of determining when a company or natural person acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company under the HOLA or the Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CBCA&#8221;). In light of the similarity between the statutes governing bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, the Federal Reserve proposed to use its established rules and processes with respect to control determinations under the HOLA and the CBCA to ensure consistency between equivalent statutes administered by the same agency. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve stated in connection with its issuance of Regulation LL that it will review investments and relationships with savings and loan holding companies by companies using the current practices and policies applicable to bank holding companies to the extent possible. Overall, the indicia of control used by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA to determine whether a company has a controlling influence over the management or policies of a banking organization (which, for Federal Reserve purposes, will now include savings associations and savings and loan holding companies) are similar to the control factors found in OTS regulations. However, the OTS rules weighed these factors somewhat differently and used a different review process designed to be more mechanical. 

&#160; 

Among the differences highlighted by the Federal Reserve with respect to OTS procedures on determinations of control, the Federal Reserve noted that it does not limit its review of companies with the potential to have a controlling influence to the two largest stockholders. Specifically, the Federal Reserve reviews all investors based on all of the facts and circumstances to determine if a controlling influence is present. 

&#160; 

Moreover, unlike the OTS control rules, the Federal Reserve does not have a separate application process for rebutting control under the BHCA and Regulation LL does not include such a process. Under the former OTS rules, investors that triggered a control factor under the rules could submit an application to the OTS requesting a determination that they have successfully rebutted control under the HOLA. This separate application process is not available under Regulation LL. Given that Federal Reserve practice is to consider potential control relationships for all investors in connection with applications submitted under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve will review potential control relationships for all investors in connection with applications submitted to the Federal Reserve under Section 10(e) or 10(o) of the HOLA. The Federal Reserve may obtain a series of passivity commitments from investors seeking to purchase in excess of 5% of the issued and outstanding common stock of savings and loan holding companies and bank holding companies. 

Federal and State Taxation 

&#160; 

Federal and State Taxation . Meta Financial and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal and various consolidated state income tax returns. Additionally, Meta Financial or its subsidiaries file separate company income tax returns in states where required. All returns are filed on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. We monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income tax due to changes in income or franchise tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. In addition to the regular income tax, corporations, including savings banks such as the Bank, generally are subject to a minimum tax. An alternative minimum tax is imposed at a minimum tax rate of 20% on alternative minimum taxable income, which is the sum of a corporation&#8217;s regular taxable income (with certain adjustments) and tax preference items, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the corporation&#8217;s regular income tax and net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. 

&#160; 

To the extent earnings appropriated to a savings bank&#8217;s bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes exceed the allowable amount of such reserves computed under the experience method and to the extent of the bank&#8217;s supplemental reserves for losses on loans (&#8220;Excess&#8221;), such Excess may not, without adverse tax consequences, be utilized for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to a stockholder (including distributions on redemption, dissolution or liquidation) or for any other purpose (except to absorb bad debt losses). As of September 30, 2016 , the Bank&#8217;s Excess for tax purposes totaled approximately $6.7 million . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Retail Banking operation faces strong competition, both in originating real estate and other loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, captive finance companies, insurance companies and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Company&#8217;s market area. Commercial banks and credit unions provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. The Company competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of the quality of services it provides to borrowers, interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the types of loans it originates. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Retail Banking operation attracts deposits through its Retail Banking offices, primarily from the communities in which those Retail Banking offices are located; therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions and brokerage offices located in the same communities. The Company competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours and convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s MPS division serves customers nationally and also faces strong competition from large commercial banks and specialty providers of electronic payments processing and servicing, including prepaid, debit and credit card issuers, Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) processors and ATM network sponsors. Many of these national players are aggressive competitors, leveraging relationships and economies of scale. 

&#160; 

It is also expected that the Bank will experience strong competition for its AFS/IBEX division with respect to financing insurance premiums and for its Refund Advantage business with respect to tax return processing services. 

Employees 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company and its subsidiaries had a total of 672 full-time equivalent employees, an increase of 34 employees, or 5.3%, from September 30, 2015 . The Company&#8217;s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good. 

&#160; 

Executive Officers of the Company Who Are Not Directors 

&#160; 

The following information as to the business experience during the past five years is provided with respect to the executive officers of the Company who are not serving on the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.
