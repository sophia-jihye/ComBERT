 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are focused on developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that provide safe and cost-effective solutions to the health and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. As a platform technology, we believe SDC is distinguished from existing products in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity and the inability of bacteria to form a resistance to it. 

&#160; 

Our SDC-based technology platform has potential application in a number of industries. Our near-term focus is on offering products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that foodborne illnesses affect more than 48 million people annually in the U.S., causing 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 fatalities. The CDC estimated that more than 9 million of these foodborne illnesses were attributed to major pathogens. The CDC reported that contaminated produce was responsible for approximately 46% of the foodborne illnesses caused by pathogens and 23% of the foodborne illness-related deaths in the US between 1998 and 2008. Among the top pathogens contributing to foodborne illness in the U.S. are Norovirus, Salmonella , Campylobacter , Staphylococcus , Shiga toxin&#8211;producing Escherichia coli and Listeria . Salmonella is the leading cause of hospitalization, followed by Norovirus, and is the leading cause of deaths related to foodborne illness. 

&#160; 

Based on these statistics, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for our safe, non-toxic and effective SDC-based solutions. We currently offer PURE &#174; Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains and food processors. We also offer PURE Control &#174; as a direct food contact processing aid. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control &#174; as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh produce in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. In July 2016, we received a &#8220;No Objection Letter&#8221; from the USDA&#8217;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing, which effectively restricts our ability to commercialize PURE Control for poultry processing until we receive such additional approval. We continue our on-going plant trials to optimize the application of PURE Control, including with higher concentrations of SDC, in OLR to gain USDA approval for use in that stage of poultry processing. Based on these on-going plant trials, we have submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow us to use higher concentrations of SDC in poultry processing to have the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. Additionally, we are currently testing and continuing development of PURE Control to allow us to seek regulatory approval to also utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. In addition to our direct sales efforts with PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we market and sell our SDC-based products indirectly through third-party distributors. 

&#160; 

Technology Platform 

&#160; 

The foundation of our technology platform is a proprietary electrochemical process that allows us to generate ionized silver in the presence of organic acid. This process creates a solution containing stabilized ionic silver that can function as an antimicrobial. Our current products all contain SDC, which we produce by ionizing silver in citric acid. SDC is a natural, non-toxic, non-caustic, colorless, odorless antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection, and that formulates well with other compounds. We have also produced ionic silver-based molecular entities using other organic acids, and we believe these compounds may provide a platform for future product development. 

&#160; 

Silver as an Antimicrobial 

&#160; 

The use of silver as an antimicrobial dates back to ancient times when water, wine and other beverages were kept in silver vessels to maintain freshness. Ancient Egyptians applied thin strips of beaten silver around wounds to avoid infection, and early royalty ate from silver plates and with silver utensils to stay healthy. In the past half-century, silver in colloidal and ionic forms has been used successfully in a wide array of antimicrobial applications, including water purification and topical treatments for burn victims. Silver must be in an ionic form to be effective at killing microorganisms. The short shelf-life of previous ionic silver solutions has limited the development of ionic-silver based antimicrobials. SDC, as a stabilized silver ion complex, has a shelf life of more than a decade because the weak bond of the silver ion to the citric acid allows the ion to remain stable in solution while at the same time making it bioavailable for antimicrobial action. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Mechanisms of Action 

&#160; 

The rapid and broad-spectrum efficacy of SDC is attributed to its dual mechanisms of action, both with respect to killing bacteria and other microorganisms and acting against viruses. SDC can kill microorganisms at both the extracellular and intracellular levels. SDC attracts bacteria because the citric acid is recognized by the organism as a food source. SDC easily enters the microorganism through membrane transport proteins. Once inside the organism, SDC binds to DNA and intracellular proteins causing irreversible damage to the DNA and protein structure. Metabolic and reproductive functions halt, and the organism dies. SDC can also act on an organism&#8217;s outer membrane. Silver ions are highly attracted to sulfur-containing thiol groups found in metabolic and structural proteins bound to the membrane surface. SDC targets these critical proteins and destroys their structure. This disruption of the organism&#8217;s membrane function and integrity leads to its death. 

&#160; 

Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and present fewer target sites on which a biocide can act. The efficacy of SDC against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses comes from its ability to destroy not only the viral envelope, preventing the virus from attaching to a host cell, but also the infectious component of the virus, the nucleic acid. 

&#160; 

Safety Profile 

&#160; 

Research has shown that silver is an effective antimicrobial and not toxic to humans at the residual levels following the use of our SDC-based products. In addition, our data shows the components of SDC, ionic silver and citric acid, to be non-toxic, particularly at the low concentrations required to eliminate microorganisms. At higher concentrations, citric acid can be an eye irritant. We have tested a concentrated SDC formulation using standard protocols to measure acute toxicity. Acute oral and dermal toxicity was not observed at doses up to and including 5000 mg/kg. Data from eye and skin studies showed only slight irritation and no dermal sensitization. 

&#160; 

GRAS Status as Contact Biocide 

&#160; 

A committee of independent experts critically reviewed efficacy and toxicity data for SDC and the SDC-based PURE Hard Surface disinfectant and food contact surface sanitizer. The committee found no evidence that SDC demonstrates a hazard to the public when used as a contact biocide on food contact surfaces and food-use utensils. The committee, therefore, concluded such use to be generally recognized as safe, consistent with the EPA registration (discussed below), allowing for use on food manufacturing and processing equipment and food preparation surfaces. 

&#160; 

Efficacy 

&#160; 

Formulations containing SDC provide complete, quick and broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and fungi. In addition to quick kill times, SDC provides residual antimicrobial activity. SDC also provides rapid kill times against multiple drug resistant bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA, Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium , or VRE, Carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli , Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, NDM-1+. See &#8220;EPA Registrations&#8221; below for more detailed efficacy data. 

&#160; 

Natural and Environmentally Responsible 

&#160; 

SDC is made of simple and all-natural ingredients: water, citric acid and minute amounts of ionic silver. SDC does not present a threat to the environment. If introduced to water systems, the low concentrations of ionic silver in SDC would react with naturally present substances such as chlorides, sulfides and organic matter. These reactions would create insoluble silver complexes and render the silver inert. In addition, we manufacture SDC through a &#8220;zero waste&#8221; process in which no byproducts or environmental effluent are created. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

U.S. Incidence and Cost of Foodborne Illness 

&#160; 

According to an Ohio State University study published in the Journal of Food Protection, completed by Dr. Scharff, a consumer science professor, foodborne illness poses a $77.7 billion economic burden in the United States annually. This cost estimate includes health related costs, associated medical costs, productivity losses, mortality, and pain and suffering. The study noted that excluding the estimated costs for pain and suffering, health related costs exceeded $51 billion. The study does not include costs to the food industry, including reduced consumer confidence, reduced brand value, product recall costs, and litigation, nor does it include the cost to public health agencies (local, state and federal) that are required to respond to illnesses and outbreaks. In addition, the study cited Salmonella as the most costly pathogen with an economic burden estimated to be in excess of $11 billion. This is primarily due to its high incidence and mortality rate.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Increased Regulatory Requirements in the U.S. 

&#160; 

The increasing trend of reported foodborne illness over the last decade has resulted in heightened awareness by various government agencies, national media and social media outlets thereby affecting consumer confidence and elevating federal and state regulatory scrutiny. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act was passed by the U.S. Congress, resulting in increased regulatory requirements for preventive controls, verification and validation of food safety plans by food processors. Additionally, in December 2013, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the USDA, announced its Salmonella Action Plan (SAP), which is focused on identifying solutions to reduce the incidence of Salmonella in meat and poultry. We believe that the implementation of the SAP will increase the need for new, effective interventions to assist in reducing the incidence of Salmonella in meat and poultry. 

&#160; 

Limitations of Existing Food Safety Solutions 

&#160; 

The statistics of the U.S. public health problems attributed to pathogens in the food supply chain demonstrate the increasing need for more effective, efficient and safer interventions. The U.S. food industry continues to rely on the use of toxic chemicals as processing aids or interventions during food processing operations for which pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant and rendering current interventions less efficacious. Most of these chemicals carry various warning labels for their toxicity characteristics and negatively affect safety of processing plant personnel, plant operating equipment and the plant environment and its surroundings.

&#160; 

Among the chemicals in current use are: peracetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), ozone, trisodium phosphate, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), organic acid rinses (lactic acid), hypobromous acid and chlorine dioxide. Some of these chemicals can be difficult to work with as a processing aid as they may require heating to become effective or are difficult to mix and stabilize prior to use. Certain of these chemicals are only specific for processing aid use to treat against specific pathogens on only certain foods. In addition, some of these chemicals can produce noxious fumes that over time have been linked to upper respiratory illness and typically require in-plant decontamination of their effluence. 

&#160; 

Several large and established corporations currently supply these chemicals. They may also provide other related food safety services such as environmental sanitation programs and food safety consultation and audit services. 

&#160; 

Our SDC-Based Products as a Food Safety Solution 

&#160; 

Based on the limitations of the existing food safety solutions, we believe that our SDC-based products, including PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, are well positioned as new and disruptive solutions for the food safety industry. Given their broad spectrum antimicrobial efficacy and non-toxic properties, our SDC-based products provide significant improvements over current chemical interventions that can both strengthen our customers&#8217; food safety practices and help them control and eliminate pathogens present during their food processing operations. 

&#160; 

Our s tudies indicate that our SDC-based products are more effective in reducing or eliminating pathogens than existing chemical interventions. Pilot poultry processing studies showed that SDC achieved an average reduction in Salmonella of 2.75 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when applied as an OLR spray and 6.28 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when combined with an immersion chilling process simulating current U.S. industry practices. This data suggests that the use of SDC in poultry processing has the potential to achieve non-detectable Salmonella levels. Similarly, pilot produce processing studies showed that SDC achieved average reductions up to 2.36 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when applied alone as a spray and up to 3.10 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when combined with chlorine wash, simulating current processing practices. Currently, produce processors hope to achieve only a 1 log 10 CFU/cm 2 reduction per intervention treatment. This data suggests that by incorporating SDC, produce processors can improve their results 100-fold with only one step. Moreover, sensory evaluations of both poultry and produce treated with SDC indicated no difference in color, appearance or odor to untreated controls. Additionally, SDC had no effect on the nutritional composition of either poultry or produce. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to providing better efficacy, our SDC-based products can provide users with the following benefits compared to the current processing chemicals they are using: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Easier to handle and dilute; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Non-corrosive to processing equipment; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Non-toxic to manufacturing personnel by not creating noxious fumes or other detrimental environmental effluence. &#160; 

Based on their performance and characteristics, we believe our SDC-based products can provide our customers with significant advantages to the chemical interventions they are currently using and help them achieve their goal of improving the safety of processed foods they offer to consumers. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to become a sustainable company by commercializing the SDC-based products we have developed with our proprietary technology platform. We are focused on delivering leading antimicrobial products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Key aspects of our business strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Expanding sales and distribution for our products into the food industry with a focus on a dual track of food safety market opportunities: &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; Hard Surface Disinfectant - commercializing our current EPA registered PURE Hard Surface disinfectant and sanitizer for use in foodservice operations and food manufacturing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Direct Food Contact - commercializing FDA approved PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce; commercializing FDA approved PURE Control as a food processing and intervention aid for food processors treating raw poultry subject to further USDA approval; expecting to commercialize, subject to both FDA and USDA approval, the use of SDC as a food processing and intervention aid for food processors treating raw beef and pork. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Establishing strategic alliances to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Developing additional proprietary products and applications; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Protecting and enhancing our intellectual property. &#160; 

In addition to our current products addressing food safety, we intend to leverage our technology platform through licensing and distribution collaborations in order to develop new products and enter into new markets that could potentially generate multiple sources of revenue. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

Our near-term focus is on delivering leading antimicrobial products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. We currently offer PURE Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains and food processors. We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh produce in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. In July 2016, we received a &#8220;No Objection Letter&#8221; from the USDA&#8217;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing, which effectively restricts our ability to commercialize PURE Control for poultry processing until we receive such additional approval. We continue our on-going plant trials to optimize the application of PURE Control, including with higher concentrations of SDC, in OLR to gain USDA approval for use in that stage of poultry processing. Based on these on-going plant trials, we have submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow us to use higher concentrations of SDC in poultry processing to have the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. Additionally, we are currently testing and continuing development of PURE Control to allow us to seek regulatory approval to also utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to our direct sales efforts with PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we market and sell our SDC-based products indirectly through third-party distributors. In addition to PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we manufacture and sell (i) SDC-based products for end use, (ii) products preserved with SDC and (iii) SDC as a raw material ingredient for manufacturing use. 

&#160; 

PURE&#174; Hard Surface Disinfectant and Sanitizer (Ready to Use) 

&#160; 

PURE Hard Surface is our SDC-based, patented and EPA-registered, ready-to-use hard surface disinfectant and food contact surface sanitizer. PURE Hard Surface combines high efficacy and low toxicity with bacterial and viral kill times in as few as 30-seconds and 24-hour residual protection. The product kills resistant pathogens such as MRSA and Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (NDM-1), and effectively eliminates dangerous fungi and viruses including HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Norovirus, Influenza A, Avian Influenza and H1N1. It also eradicates hazardous food pathogens such as E. coli , Salmonella , Campylobacter and Listeria . PURE Hard Surface delivers broad-spectrum efficacy yet remains classified as least-toxic by the EPA. The active ingredient, SDC, has been designated as &#8220;Generally Recognized as Safe,&#8221; or GRAS, for use on food processing equipment, machinery and utensils. 

&#160; 

PURE Control&#174; 

&#160; 

We have the necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA to offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce and raw poultry. We also have regulatory approvals from the USDA for certain methods of application of PURE Control on poultry and we are also performing additional trials to gain further USDA approvals for additional food contact applications for poultry. Additionally, we are currently testing and continuing development of PURE Control to allow us to seek regulatory approval to also utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. 

&#160; 

Poultry Processing Aid. In December 2015, we received the required approvals from the FDA stating that our FCN (food contact notification) for SDC as a raw poultry processing aid is complete. We have received a &#8220;No Objection Letter&#8221; from the USDA&#8217;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing, which effectively restricts our ability to commercialize PURE Control for poultry processing until we receive such additional approval. We continue our on-going plant trials to optimize the application of PURE Control, including with higher concentrations of SDC, in OLR to gain USDA approval for use in that stage of poultry processing. Based on these on-going plant trials, we have submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow us to use higher concentrations of SDC in poultry processing to have the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. 

&#160; 

Testing data conducted by Dr. James Marsden at Kansas State University and submitted in support of our FCN showed that, SDC achieved an average reduction in Salmonella of 2.75 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when applied as an OLR (online reprocessing) spray and 6.28 log 10 CFU/cm 2 when combined with an immersion chilling process simulating current U.S. industry practices. We believe that testing by Dr. Marsden provides support to the following benefits of SDC for poultry processing: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The use of SDC antimicrobial solution in poultry processing has the potential to enable plants to achieve non-detectable Salmonella levels post-chill process. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; A sensory evaluation of SDC showed no difference in color, appearance or odor in treated poultry. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; SDC has a neutral to positive impact on yield. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; SDC offers a highly effective alternative to hazardous and difficult to blend chemicals currently used as treatments in raw poultry processing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; SDC is a significant improvement over current processing practices. The product is: &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#9675; Easier to handle and dilute; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9675; Non-corrosive to processing equipment; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9675; Does not create noxious fumes; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9675; Poultry processors will also benefit from the highly stable solution, ease of use and improved worker safety. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Produce Processing Aid . In January 2016, we received the required approvals from the FDA stating that our FCN for SDC as a spray or dip on processed fruits and vegetables is complete. We were not required to obtain any approvals from the USDA to use PURE Control as a produce processing aid. 

&#160; 

Data from testing conducted by Dr. James Marsden at Kansas State University and submitted in support of our FCN for produce showed that SDC achieved average reductions up to 2.36 log10 CFU/cm2 when applied alone as a spray and up to 3.10 log10 CFU/cm2 when combined with chlorine wash, simulating current processing practices. Sensory evaluations of produce treated with SDC indicated no difference in color, appearance or odor to untreated controls; and SDC had no effect on the nutritional composition of the produce. 

&#160; 

Currently, produce processors target achieving only a 1 log10 CFU/cm2 reduction per intervention treatment. Data suggests that by incorporating SDC, processors can improve their results 100-fold with only one step. This represents a significant advantage to produce processors as well as improvement to the safety of processed produce going to the consumer. 

&#160; 

Other Processing Aids under Development . We are currently testing and continuing development of PURE Control to allow us to seek regulatory approval to also utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. Subject to successful pilot testing results and development, we intend to submit for both FDA and USDA approval during 2017. In addition, we may identify other food processing opportunities for SDC.

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our policy is to pursue patents and trademarks, maintain trade secrets and use other means to protect our technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. 

&#160; 

We have applied for U.S. and foreign patent protection for our SDC technology. Currently, we own twelve U.S. issued patents. Approximately twenty-six patents have been issued outside of the U.S., and we own approximately ten patents pending around the world. The expiration dates for our ten U.S. issued patents begin in 2018 and end in 2030. In September 2013, we decided to abandon pending and issued patents in non-strategic international territories. Future patent prosecution and defense efforts are intended primarily for North America, Europe, Asia and Mexico. 

&#160; 

Additional patent applications may not be granted, or, if granted, may not provide adequate protection to us. We also intend to rely on whatever protection the law affords to trade secrets, including unpatented know-how. Other companies, however, may independently develop equivalent or superior technologies or processes and may obtain patents or similar rights with respect thereto. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that we have developed our technology independently and have not infringed, and do not infringe, on the patents of others, third parties may make claims that our technology does infringe on their patents or other intellectual property. In the event of infringement, we may, under certain circumstances, be required to modify our infringing product or process or obtain a license. We may not be able to do either of those things in a timely manner if at all, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action or to defend ourselves against such actions brought by others. If any of the products we develop infringe upon the patent or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, be enjoined or become liable for damages, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

We also rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, advisors, licensees and potential partners to protect our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary property. Pursuant to the foregoing and for other reasons, we face the risk that our competitors may acquire information which we consider to be proprietary, that such parties may breach such agreements or that such agreements will be inadequate or unenforceable. 

&#160; 

Further, we own the registered trademarks or pending trademark applications for PURE Bioscience &#174; , Powered by SDC Ag+ &#174; , PURE &#174; , Axenohl &#174; , Axen &#174; , SILV&#201;RION &#174; , and PURE Control &#174; . In addition, we have applications for other trademarks pending around the world, which may or may not be granted. We previously allowed the marks Kinderguard &#174; , Cruise Control &#174; , Staphacide &#174; , Nutripure &#174; , Elderguard &#174; , and Critterguard &#174; to go abandoned, as they were no longer in line with our food safety business strategy. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We recognize the importance of innovation to our business strategy and long-term success. A key aspect of our business strategy is to leverage our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products and applications, including end use products and raw material formulations derived from our technology platform. We conduct our primary research and development activities in-house and use third-party laboratories to conduct independent testing. We also engage development partners to perform research and development activities at their own expense for specific products and processes using SDC. Amounts spent on research and development activities during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 were $927,000 and $790,000, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have developed several new SDC-based products, including a dilutable food processing aid PURE Control. In addition, we may continue to develop or may develop with strategic partners various other SDC-based product candidates including a dilutable food contact surface sanitizer, hard surface disinfecting and skin cleansing wipes, formulations for industrial biofilm control, high level disinfectants, agriculture treatments, dilutable sanitizer and virucide, food additives and preservatives as well as medical products. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

A critical aspect of our business strategy is to leverage the industry experience of our internal sales force and management team in order to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform in the food industry. During 2015 and 2016, we strengthened our internal sales and marketing capability by adding to our team experienced food industry sales professionals. 

&#160; 

According to the CDC, FDA and other food industry sources, food contamination and food borne illnesses have been increasing. We believe our focus on food safety is addressing a significant need to provide safe, non-toxic and effective solutions to mitigate the increase of food contamination and food borne illnesses. We believe our products can be used effectively to prevent or mitigate the risk of food contaminants in various stages of the food supply chain. Our current sales and marketing efforts include demonstrating our SDC products&#8217; effectiveness as a hard surface disinfectant and sanitizer for: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Foodservice operators &#8211; such as food preparation and cooking surfaces; consumer eating and other common areas; and drink and ice dispensers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Food manufacturers and processors &#8211; such as food production and transportation equipment. &#160; 

Our sales team is actively developing customer relationships with certain segments of foodservice operators, food processors and food manufacturers. Due to both the technical nature of our products and existence of established brands, the sales cycle to secure a new customer is long and unpredictable. We have recently conducted numerous successful product evaluation trials and comparative testing of our SDC-based products with prospective customers, which we believe will result in future revenue. We believe our products provide superior pathogen and hygiene control performance characteristics as compared with legacy chemical products, which also have higher toxicity profiles than our SDC-based products. 

&#160; 

In addition to our direct sales and marketing efforts, we intend to selectively form partnerships with industry leaders for a variety of uses and applications of our products and technology. These partnerships may be for both U.S. and international markets where we believe we may leverage the product development, sales and marketing resources of business partners to commercialize our SDC technology in their respective markets. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our historical revenues were generated by an international chemical distributor who sold our SDC-based formulations to other manufacturers for use as a raw material ingredient in the production of personal care products. Other historical revenues were primarily to U.S. distributors who sold our SDC-based products into the consumer, industrial janitorial and sanitization market. 

&#160; 

Sales Concentration 

&#160; 

Net product sales were $1,289,000 and $729,000 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended July 31, 2016, one customer accounted for 37% of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows for the year ended July 31, 2016: 100% U.S. For the year ended July 31, 2015, one customer accounted for 47% of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows for the year ended July 31, 2015: 97% U.S. and 3% foreign. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

From time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. Our three largest customers accounted for 54% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these agreements typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. A decision by any of our major customers to significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets for SDC, our SDC-based products and each of their potential applications are highly competitive. We have a number of competitors that vary in size, scope and breadth of products offered. These competitors include some of the largest global corporations, and most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do and offer multiple service and product offerings as well as consulting services to their customers. We expect to face additional competition from other competitors and technologies in the future. 

&#160; 

Because SDC is a new antimicrobial technology to the food industry, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to achieve a share of our target markets at the expense of established and future products. Even where SDC may have technological competitive advantages over competing products, we, our partners or our distributors, will need to invest significant resources in order to attempt to displace traditional technologies sold by, what are in many cases, well-known industry leaders. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

On December 11, 2013, we entered into a five-year strategic collaboration agreement with St. Louis-based Intercon Chemical Company (ICC). The agreement consists of a multi-prong approach to help us accelerate the commercialization of our unique and proprietary SDC-based products. The strategic collaboration agreement provides: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; ICC licenses from PURE its patents and technology know-how for the exclusive manufacture of our SDC-based products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ICC will invest in plant improvements to allow for expanded SDC production. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; &#160; ICC&#8217;s R&#38;D team will collaborate on SDC product line development. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ICC licenses the distribution rights for SDC-based products into its core businesses of institutional cleaning and sanitation products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ICC will also develop a new initiative focused on US hospital, healthcare and medical facilities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; PURE earns royalty income on SDC-products sold by ICC and its affiliates. &#160; 

The agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent, or by either party upon the material breach of the terms of the agreement by the other party. 

&#160; 

Silver is the primary active ingredient in SDC and is a readily available commodity. The other active and inactive ingredients in our products are readily available from multiple sources. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to various government regulations relating to the protection of public health and the environment. Among these are laws that regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution and labeling of our products, as well as the use, handling, storage and disposal of certain materials in the manufacturing of our products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation in the United States 

&#160; 

Certain environmental and regulatory matters significant to us are discussed below. 

&#160; 

Requirements Imposed by the EPA and Similar State Agencies 

&#160; 

We manufacture and sell in the U.S. certain disinfecting products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi). The manufacture, labeling, handling and use of these products are regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA. We currently sell three products registered by the EPA under FIFRA, certain of which are approved for use on food contact surfaces and others of which are approved for use on non-food contact hard surfaces. EPA product registration requires meeting certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and paying ongoing registration fees. 

&#160; 

Although states do not generally impose substantive requirements different from those of the EPA, each state in which our products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs applicable to these types of products that, in some cases, impose a fee on total product sales in the state. 

&#160; 

Based on our experience and our knowledge of current trends, we expect the costs and delays in receiving necessary federal and state approvals for these types of products may increase in the coming years. 

&#160; 

Requirements Imposed by the FDA and USDA 

&#160; 

The FDA&#8217;s Food Contact Notification (&#8220;FCN&#8221;) Program is intended to ensure the safety of Food Contact Substances (FCS) used in food processing and packaging. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The FCN review period is 120 days from filing, after which, if there are no concerns from the FDA, the FCN automatically becomes effective. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; An FCN is considered to be proprietary as it applies only to the specific product and manufacturer or supplier identified in the FCN. &#160; 

In addition to the FDA&#8217;s FCN Program, the Company will be required to obtain USDA approval for the use of PURE Control on meat or dairy products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; Upon the FDA&#8217;s granting of an FCN on a meat or dairy product, PURE will be required to submit the FCN to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the USDA for a new technology review. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; As part of the FSIS review process, PURE may be required to conduct up to three in-plant process validation and optimization trials with the authorization of the USDA. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; After successful completion of the in-plant validation trials, the USDA will issue a &#8220;Letter of No Objection&#8221; and list the Company&#8217;s SDC-based product as an OLR processing aid in Attachment 1 of FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in the Production of Meat and Poultry Products. &#160; 

Requirements Imposed by Ingredient Legislation 

&#160; 

Numerous federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals on the labels of products. Although none of the ingredients in our current products is reportable under Proposition 65, this and other similar legislation may become more comprehensive in the future and/or new products we may develop could be subject to these regulations. 

&#160; 

Requirements Imposed by Other Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

A number of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws govern the use, handling, storage and disposal of certain materials. Our current manufacturing process for SDC-based products is a &#8220;zero waste&#8221; process, meaning that no byproducts are created, and we do not use hazardous materials, as defined by applicable environmental laws, in the manufacturing of these products. As such, some of these U.S. environmental laws are not generally applicable to us in their current form. However, these laws may in the future identify as hazardous materials certain materials that we use in our manufacturing processes, or we may opt to or be forced to change our manufacturing procedures in a way that subjects our products or operations to these laws. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Requirements Imposed by the FDA and USDA 

&#160; 

Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products we anticipate manufacturing and selling for controlling microbial growth in or on foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the FDA. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied directly to food as it pertains to poultry and meats. 

&#160; 

Regulation Outside the United States 

&#160; 

The commercialization of SDC-based products in countries other than the U.S. may require that we, or companies with whom we partner for such foreign commercialization, obtain necessary approvals from foreign regulatory authorities comparable to the EPA and USDA, among others. Applicable approval processes and ongoing requirements vary from country to country and may involve more time and expense than that required to obtain approvals in the U.S. In international markets, we currently sell our products under active registrations held by us, or by our distributors. We intend to continue to process registrations ourselves or through distributors as required. 

&#160; 

We currently hold a registration from Health Canada for our disinfectant product. Other third-party distributors are actively pursuing registrations for our disinfectant products in various Asian markets. Additionally, an opinion has been granted under the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products to sell SDC in the European Union for use in cosmetics, which includes personal care products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 27, 2016, we employed 13 regular full-time employees. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160;
