 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

Career Education Corporation (&#8220;CEC&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware in 1994. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;the Company&#8221; and &#8220;CEC&#8221; refer to Career Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The terms &#8220;college,&#8221; &#8220;institution&#8221; and &#8220;university&#8221; each refer to an individual, branded, for-profit educational institution owned by us and includes its campus locations. The term &#8220;campus&#8221; refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our colleges, institutions or universities.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Career Education&#8217;s academic institutions offer a quality education to a diverse student population in a variety of disciplines through online, campus-based and hybrid learning programs. Our two universities &#8211; American InterContinental University (&#8220;AIU&#8221;) and Colorado Technical University (&#8220;CTU&#8221;) &#8211; provide degree programs through the master&#8217;s or doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor&#8217;s levels. Both universities predominantly serve students online with career-focused degree programs that are designed to meet the educational demands of today&#8217;s busy adults. AIU and CTU continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing new personalized learning technologies like their intelli path &#8482; adaptive learning platform that allow students to more efficiently pursue earning a degree by receiving course credit for knowledge they can already demonstrate. Career Education is committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.

In May 2015, we made the strategic decision to focus our resources and attention on our two universities. In accordance with that strategy, we are in the process of closing our remaining Career School campuses through a gradual teach-out process.

A listing of individual campus locations and web links to our colleges, institutions and universities can be found at www.careered.com .

Our reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 280&#8212; Segment Reporting and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a group of postsecondary education providers that offer a variety of degree and non-degree academic programs. These segments are organized by key market segments to enhance operational alignment and, for our two universities, to enhance brand focus within each segment to more effectively execute our strategic plan.

Our four reporting segments as of December 31, 2015 are described below.

University Group:

&#160;

&#168; 

Colorado Technical University (CTU) places a strong focus on providing industry-relevant degree programs to meet the needs of our students for employment and of employers for a well-educated workforce and offers academic programs in the career-oriented disciplines of business studies, information systems and technologies, criminal justice, computer science and engineering, and health sciences. Students pursue their degrees through fully-online programs through CTU Online, local campuses and blended formats, which combine campus-based and online education. As of December 31, 2015, students enrolled at CTU represented approximately 49% of our total enrollments. Approximately 92% of CTU&#8217;s enrollments are fully online. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#168; 

American InterContinental University (AIU) focuses on helping busy professionals get the degree they need to move forward in their career as efficiently as possible and offers academic programs in the career-oriented disciplines of business studies, information technologies, criminal justice and design technologies. Students pursue their degrees through fully- 

&#160;

online programs through AIU Online, local campuses and ble nded formats, which combine campus-based and online education. As of December 31, 2015, students enrolled at AIU represented approximately 25% of our total enrollments. Approximately 92% of AIU&#8217;s enrollments are fully online. 

Career Schools Group:

Campuses included in our Career School segments include those which are currently being taught out or those which have completed their teach-out activities or have been sold subsequent to January 1, 2015. As a result of a change in accounting guidance, campuses which have closed or have been sold subsequent to January 1, 2015 no longer meet the criteria for discontinued operations and remain reported within continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements. Campuses in teach-out employ a gradual teach-out process, enabling them to continue to operate while current students have a reasonable opportunity to complete their course of study; they no longer enroll new students. 

&#160;

&#168; 

Culinary Arts includes our Le Cordon Bleu institutions in North America (&#8220;LCB&#8221;) which offer hands-on educational programs in the career-oriented disciplines of culinary arts and patisserie and baking in the commercial-grade kitchens of Le Cordon Bleu. LCB also provides online programs in culinary arts and hotel and restaurant management. These campuses are expected to complete their teach-out activities primarily during 2017. As of December 31, 2015, students enrolled at LCB represented approximately 18% of our total enrollments. 

&#160;

Our LCB campuses were previously recorded as an asset held for sale within discontinued operations as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the decision made during December 2015 to teach-out our LCB campuses, they are now reported as part of continuing operations within the Culinary Arts segment.

&#160;

&#160;

&#168; 

Transitional Group includes our non-LCB campuses which are in teach-out or those which have been closed or sold subsequent to January 1, 2015. Our Transitional Group offers academic programs primarily in the career-oriented discipline of health education complemented by certain programs in business studies and information technology, as well as fashion design, film and video production, graphic design, interior design and visual communications. The campuses within the Transitional Group that have not yet ceased operations as of December 31, 2015 will complete their teach-outs on varying dates through 2018. As of December 31, 2015, students enrolled at the Transitional Group campuses represented approximately 8% of our total enrollments. 

&#160;

During 2015 we completed the sale of two colleges, Brooks Institute and Missouri College, and completed the teach-out of five campuses within our Transitional Group. The results of operations for these campuses will remain reported within the Transitional Group as part of continuing operations, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, which limits discontinued operations reporting effective January 1, 2015.

&#160;

All prior period results have been recast to reflect our reporting segments on a comparable basis.

Revenues, operating income (loss) and total assets by reporting segment for each of the past three fiscal years are included in Note 18 &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

CAMPUS LOCATIONS 

Our reporting segments, colleges and universities, and their campus locations, as of February 29, 2016 are summarized in the table below. Campuses that ceased operations prior to February 29, 2016 are not included.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND COMPETITION

The postsecondary education industry is highly fragmented and increasingly competitive, with no one provider controlling a significant market share. Students choose among providers based on programs and degrees offered, program flexibility and convenience, quality of instruction, employment placement rates, reputation, recruiting effectiveness and cost. Such multi-faceted market fragmentation results in significant differentiation among various education providers.

The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized (&#8220;Higher Education Act&#8221;), and the related regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in federal student aid and loan programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (&#8220;Title IV Programs&#8221;). According to the National Center for Education Statistics (&#8220;NCES&#8221;), there were approximately 7,300 Title IV eligible postsecondary education institutions in the United States for the academic year 2014-15, including approximately 3,400 proprietary schools; approximately 2,000 public, non-profit schools; and approximately 1,900 private, non-profit schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education (&#8220;ED&#8221; or &#8220;the Department&#8221;), over the 12-month period July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014 approximately 28 million students were attending institutions that participate in the various Title IV Programs.

Our primary public company competitors in the for-profit postsecondary education industry are: Apollo Education Group, Inc., Bridgepoint Education, Inc., Capella Education Company, DeVry Education Group Inc., Grand Canyon Education, Inc., ITT Educational Services, Inc., Kaplan, Inc. (a division of the Graham Holdings Company) and Strayer Education, Inc. We also compete with a number of privately held for-profit and non-profit postsecondary institutions, including community colleges. In addition, there is growing competition from online programs among postsecondary education institutions, including for-profit publicly traded and privately held institutions, as well as non-profit institutions who are increasing online offerings in response to the growing demand.

Our postsecondary institutions are subject to significant regulations which provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilit ies for each of the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The accrediting agencies recognized by ED; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The federal government through ED; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

State higher education regulatory bodies. 

Extensive and increasingly complex ED regulations governing our institutions as well as others in the postsecondary education industry have been enacted. These regulations, coupled with the increased focus by the U.S. Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education, as well as the evolving needs and objectives of students and employers, economic constraints affecting educational institutions and increased focus on affordability and value may cause increased competition across the industry as well as contribute to changes in business operating strategies. 

Although competition exists, for-profit educators serve a segment of the market for postsecondary education that we believe has not been fully addressed by traditional public and private universities. Non-profit public and private institutions can face limited financial resources to expand their offerings in response to growth or changes in the demand for education, due to a combination of state funding challenges, significant expenditures required for research and the professor tenure system. Certain private institutions also may control enrollments to preserve the perceived prestige and exclusivity of their degree offerings. In contrast, for-profit providers of postsecondary education offer potential students the greater flexibility and convenience of their institutions' programmatic offerings and learning structure and an emphasis on applied content. At the same time, the share of the postsecondary education market that has been captured by for-profit providers remains relatively small. As a result, we believe that in spite of recent regulatory changes and other challenges facing the industry, for-profit, postsecondary education providers continue to have significant opportunities to address the demand for postsecondary education.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths differentiate our business:

Commitment to our students through focus on student experience, student retention and student outcomes. Our focus remains on strengthening academic outcomes through focus on the entire student life cycle from enrollment through completion of their program. As an education company, academic outcomes are the most relevant and critical measure of our success. We have been focused on putting the right leaders in our institutions to further our priority of strengthening our academic outcomes. Our campuses are dedicated to recruiting and retaining quality faculty and instructors with relevant industry experience and appropriate academic credentials. We continue to invest and leverage technology to further enhance student learning and faculty engagement. We seek to identify emerging industry trends in order to understand the evolving educational needs of our students and graduates and we continue to work with our University accreditors to expand our program offerings to provide students with increased offerings. 

Proprietary online instructional platform. Development of a virtual campus that engages online students with their instructor, their peers and the content is critical to the achievement of improved student learning outcomes. CEC&#8217;s online instructional delivery is accomplished utilizing an innovative, student-focused proprietary learning management system. While online content delivery is very common today, CEC&#8217;s course content delivery system, M.U.S.E. (My Unique Student Experience), has several features that make it distinctive in the education marketplace. Designed around the students, M.U.S.E. is a rich, engaging student experience that represents an innovative online method of delivering content that includes the following capabilities: 

&#160;

&#183; 

supports multiple learning styles, allowing students to choose their preferred method of engaging with the content; 

&#160;

&#183; 

enables students to choose the order of topics to study within a predetermined framework of learning objectives; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

provides search capability that allows students to interact with the content more efficiently and effectively. 

&#160;

In addition, CTU and AIU have each rolled out a mobile application during 2015 which was created to complement students&#8217; mobile-centric lives. The mobile applications offer users the ability to connect with their university, track grades and degree progress in real-time and participate in courses from the palm of their hand. The student benefits of the mobile applications include motivating students, helping them connect with the university and remain on track with their course of study.

Innovative adaptive learning technology . Through our equity investment in CCKF, a Dublin-based educational technology company that provides intelligent, adaptive systems to power the delivery of individualized and personalized learning, we have strengthened our leadership position as an innovator in higher education and as a company dedicated to student success. Our adaptive learning content was developed by teams of our own instructors and has been integrated across many of our curricula. We have a perpetual license to this technology, which we refer to as intelli path. TM This academic and technological breakthrough has the potential to advance our understanding of the learning process and support improved student outcomes. Adaptive learning, supported by intelli path technology, allows us to visualize how each student learns through their interaction with the material. 

Intelli path serves as a powerful platform to help our students learn. It identifies and gives more time in areas where students need more help, while moving past areas they already know. In m any respects, adaptive learning serves as an excellent way to facilitate and demonstrate mastery in a competency-based learning environment. Adaptive learning is changing the nature of higher education by measuring real-time knowledge growth minute-by-minu te and understanding of the material on a student-by-student basis. 

The success of this personalized learning platform lies in the abundance of data it collects, which in turn helps our instructors determine how to structure courses, deliver material to students, predict and mitigate individual student challenges and identify teaching practices that yield the strongest results. A major difference between our platform and others is that it focuses on student learning achievements rather than solely on student satisfaction, or how fast it facilitates a student to complete assignments.

Transformation Efforts. The strategic decisions made over the past several years to exit our Career Schools and International campuses and focus our resources and attention on our University institutions will enhance our financial and operating performance and enable us to focus more on student outcomes at our University institutions. Further, we have the capability to explore various options available to us to meet the challenges posed by various regulatory requirements that have been introduced within the industry and to continue to build upon our strong University platforms. 

Seasonality

Our quarterly net revenues and income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. The seasonality of our business has decreased over the last several years due to an increased percentage of students enrolling in online programs, which generally experience less seasonal fluctuations than campus-based programs. However, we typically experience our lowest revenue levels during our third fiscal quarter as a result of those students who do follow a typical institution calendar and take summer breaks. While operating costs for our institutions generally do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, we do traditionally increase our advertising investments during the first and third fiscal quarters in relation to the back to school seasons. Revenues, operating loss and net income (loss) by quarter for each of the past two fiscal years are included in Note 19 &#8220;Quarterly Financial Summary&#8221; of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS AND OPERATING STRATEGY

To compete successfully in today&#8217;s demanding economy, people benefit from higher education that provides a foundation of knowledge and skills they can use in the workplace and to build meaningful careers. We aim to provide effective, industry-relevant postsecondary education to a diverse population, providing our students the opportunity to use their education to advance personally and professionally.

Our strategic plan is aimed at addressing near-term demands for higher education with a career focus, while continuing to build the capabilities necessary to deliver sustainable long-term growth for our organization and its institutions. Within our University Group, we are focused on increasing the efficacy of our programs while seeking operational efficiencies in an effort to continually improve the student experience across the entire student lifecycle - for our campus-based students as well as our online students.

Promoting interest with prospective students and building excitement about our institutions and a career path that they can follow is key to the future success of our institutions. We continue to refine and reinvent the ways in which we identify, attract and enroll students. We have begun using enhanced new student orientation courses, which are conducted online for students planning to take courses online, as well as those enrolling at ground campuses. The online orientation courses, which include our innovative intelli path &#8482; adaptive learning platform, aim to improve our incoming students&#8217; experiences as they adjust to higher education, giving them resources and offering tips to help them hit the ground running so they have the right tools and are confident they can succeed. By offering a more enhanced and engaging orientation, this new approach offers students a better opportunity to become acclimated with their new school and determine whether it&#8217;s the right fit for them. This is in keeping with our desire to make sure students are comfortable they are making the right decision by enrolling in one of our institutions.

The importance of quality education at our institutions cannot be overstated. The quality of the education we provide and the manner in which we provide it can directly lead to better student outcomes. We will strive to offer new programs at institutions and particular campuses as there is both student demand for the education, as well as workplace demand for graduates in that field of study. Known as an innovator in online education, we will continue to build upon that history and continue developing new education technologies that enhance the learning experience for students. We believe our intelli path &#8482; adaptive learning platform provides our national organization and its institutions a strategic advantage by providing a more customized student experience and we will continue to expand its use as a key differentiator.

Lastly, creating a financially stable platform with which to grow our University institutions aligns student interests with stockholder value. Our recent and continued transformation efforts have given us the tools needed to focus our resources and attention on our University institutions. We are committed to investing in our University brands, technology and faculty, all of which contribute to positive student experiences and outcomes. 

Student Enrollment and Education 

Student Recruitment and Marketing

Our institutions seek highly motivated, career-oriented students with both the desire and ability to complete their academic programs of choice. To promote interest among potential students, each of our universities engages in a wide variety of marketing activities. We are concentrated on enhancing our brand perception by continuing to focus on building strong brand recognition. We also seek to differentiate our online institutions and brands through our innovative information technology architecture. Through our proprietary virtual campus, we have the ability to provide unique online and blended learning environments.

We seek to increase enrollment at our University Group through marketing programs designed to differentiate our brands in the marketplace and maximize each institution&#8217;s opportunity to serve a targeted section of the potential student population. 

Within our University Group, we continue our focus on expanding strategic relationships with corporate partners. We expect these relationships to result in new student interest through increased awareness of our brands for the employees of our corporate partners.

Admissions

CEC has historically served a diverse student population. Our students represent a broad range of educational and employment experiences, contributing to their college-level readiness. Each of our University Group institutions has an admissions staff who is responsible for interacting with individuals interested in enrolling. Admissions advisors serve as prospective students&#8217; primary contacts, providing information to help them make informed enrollment decisions and assisting them with the completion of the enrollment process. 

The admissions and entrance processes for our institutions are intended to identify students who are interested in meeting the requirements of their chosen program of study. We believe that a success-oriented student body ultimately results in higher student retention and post-graduation employment rates, increased student and employer satisfaction, and lower default rates on government loans utilized by the student. Generally, to be qualified for admission to one of our institutions, an applicant must have received a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent, such as a General Education Development certificate. Some of our programs may also require applicants to meet other admissions requirements, such as obtaining certain minimum scores on assessment examinations.

Our orientation process encourages students to engage actively in preparatory activities which can include an adaptive learning module, a discussion board assignment and an individual project. This orientation program also provides the opportunity for students to understand our academic and support services. We believe completion of these activities will better prepare a student to make an informed decision about pursuing their education as well as to be more successful as it simulates their classroom experience both online and in a campus-based environment. Campus-based students have the opportunity to engage with faculty, staff and current students during orientation which builds confidence and a comfort level in their new learning environment. Orientation is free of charge and offered to all students prior to the start of the first course. Completion of orientation does not financially obligate students nor does it require students to continue their education with the university. Students have the opportunity to cancel their enrollment at any time during orientation without incurring a financial obligation. 

Student Retention

We emphasize the importance of student retention at each of our institutions. As is the case at any postsecondary educational institution, a portion of our students fail to complete their academic programs for a variety of academic, financial or personal reasons. We also employ student advisors that provide feedback and assistance to students during their course of study. We seek to improve retention rates by building a strong connection between our faculty and students and promoting instructional innovation, such as our M.U.S.E. instructional platform. These efforts, as well as our implementation of our intelli path adaptive learning technology, are designed to assist our students to remain in school and succeed.

Student Graduation and Employment

The employment of our students in their field of study is an important element of our educational mission. To this end, each of our institutions has a career services department whose primary responsibility is to help prepare students to conduct a successful job search and to help identify job opportunities with employers. In addition, our career services staff assists students in identifying employment to assist with financial support while our students pursue their education. Employer relationship development, part-time employment and internship opportunities are important parts of our overall employment success strategy, as they lead to future opportunities for our students and graduates in their chosen profession.

Student Enrollment Statistics

Our total student enrollment as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately 43,200 students and 50,200 students, respectively. Included in total student enrollment were approximately 31,900 students and 32,000 students, respectively, for our University institutions, with approximately 29,200 students and 28,900 students, respectively, enrolled in our University Group fully-

online academic programs. Related student enrollment demographic information for our University Group as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 w as as follows:

Student Academics

We believe learning outcomes and career readiness are attained by our students as a result of the quality learning experience they are provided. Those learning experiences are facilitated by career-oriented curricula, engaging instructional delivery, qualified faculty and accessible student support services. 

Curriculum

Our colleges, institutions and universities develop and deliver a variety of programs resulting in the award of credentials ranging from certificates and diplomas to master&#8217;s and doctoral degrees in career-oriented programs of study including business studies, information technologies, criminal justice, computer science and engineering, culinary arts, health science and health education.

CEC&#8217;s curricula, instructional delivery tools, and experienced faculty comprise the learning experience that appeals to our student population and provides them with a unique opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies required for specific career outcomes. The curriculum development process focuses on desired career outcomes, while considering relative competencies necessary to achieve these career outcomes, as well as recommendations set forth by advisory boards, programmatic accrediting agencies and industry standards. Subsequently, learning objectives are identified and courses are developed which foster student engagement in activities and optimally result in the attainment of program learning outcomes and employment readiness.

Instructional Delivery 

CEC&#8217;s instructional delivery is based upon the belief that learning is dependent upon instructional methodologies that facilitate student engagement with the instructor, with other students and with the course content. This engagement is fundamental to student learning outcomes, regardless of whether instruction occurs within a physical or virtual classroom.

Construction of a virtual campus that engages online students with their instructor, their peers and the content is critical to the achievement of student learning outcomes. CEC&#8217;s online instructional delivery is accomplished utilizing an innovative, student-focused learning management system. While online content delivery is very common today, CEC&#8217;s course content delivery system, M.U.S.E. (My Unique Student Experience), has several features that make it distinctive in the education marketplace. Designed around the students, M.U.S.E. is a rich, engaging student experience that represents an innovative online method of delivering content that includes the following capabilities:

&#160;

&#183; 

supports multiple learning styles, allowing students to choose their preferred method of engaging with the content; 

&#160;

&#183; 

enables students to choose the order of topics to study within a predetermined framework of learning objectives; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

provides search capability that allows students to interact with the content more efficiently and effectively. 

CEC continues to invest in its methods for delivering online education. CEC has implemented the use of sophisticated adaptive learning technologies, referred to as intelli path, within our University institutions. Our roll-out of these technological tools is coupled with extensive faculty training. Continuous assessment facilitates the development of individualized, dynamic learning maps that both illustrate where student mastery has been achieved and where additional work is needed. Both the student and the instructor can see in real time where learning has taken place and where effort still needs to be applied.

&#160;

CTU and AIU have each rolled out a mobile application during 2015 which was created to complement students&#8217; mobile-centric lives. The mobile applications offer users the ability to connect with their university, track grades and degree progress in real-time and participate in courses from the palm of their hand. The student benefits of the mobile applications include motivating students, helping them connect with the university and remain on track with their course of study.

Library Services

Campus-based and online students have access to the Cybrary, a collection of electronic resources that has been developed to support the curricula offered by each CEC institution. All campus-based and online students have access to a team of reference librarians and students may request assistance through instant messaging, telephone or email. The online library resources and services exist to extend and enhance those resources and services that are provided on physical campuses as well as to support fully online students.

Faculty

CEC employs more than 3,250 credentialed, geographically disbursed, full-time and adjunct faculty who facilitate learning in our classrooms, kitchens, labs, studios and virtual classrooms. Our faculty are hired, assigned, developed and evaluated in compliance with current accepted higher education practice and in compliance with state, institutional accreditation and programmatic accreditation standards. Generally, all colleges and universities require the instructor to have a degree at least one level higher than the level of course being taught (with the exception of faculty in our doctoral programs) plus teaching and/or industry experience. General education faculty members must possess at least a master&#8217;s degree. The average tenure of a CEC faculty member is greater than four years. We believe the longevity of our instructors is a testament to the focus we place on student learning and the consistent quality we strive for in our classrooms. 

Although faculty members will always serve as the primary point of contact, students may also engage the assistance of tutors and academic advisors. Students have access to technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Faculty Competencies

With the input of faculty and academic leadership across each of our institutions, we have developed a set of instructor competencies that are critical to student success and institutional effectiveness. These competencies provide the basis for faculty recruitment, hiring, orientation, evaluation and development. The competencies apply to all instructors, regardless of content area, instructional platform (campus-based or online) and employment status (full-time, part-time, adjunct). Faculty hired by any CEC institution must demonstrate proficiency in each of the following competencies:

&#160;

&#183; 

communication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

assessment of student learning; 

&#160;

&#183; 

instructional methodology (pedagogy); 

&#160;

&#183; 

subject matter expertise; 

&#160;

&#183; 

utilization of technology to enhance teaching and learning; 

&#160;

&#183; 

acknowledgement and accommodation of diversity in learners; 

&#160;

&#183; 

student engagement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

promotion of active student learning; 

&#160;

&#183; 

compliance with policy; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

demonstration of scholarship. 

Faculty Development

Instructors are required to participate in faculty development activities each year as part of the continuous improvement process. The objective of faculty development is to increase proficiency in each of the instructor competencies. Performance strength and opportunities guide the selection of faculty development activities. Campuses typically provide locally developed in-service professional development activities for their own faculty. We also provide faculty with interactive content, available in an asynchronous format, in areas such as teaching methodology, instructional practice, classroom management, outcomes assessment and student retention.

In 2015, certain of our campuses participated in an Educator of the Year recognition program. The program is designed to showcase faculty members who developed and implemented creative and innovative approaches to meet the needs of their students as well as participated in building notable community relationship/partnerships. This year, the focus of the recognition programs were: influencing student success, teaching excellence and innovation and community service/partnership.

CEC&#8217;s recognition of outstanding faculty acknowledges our belief that the quality of the interaction between the instructor and the student is central to providing our student with a high quality learning experience.

ACCREDITATION AND JURSIDICTIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS

Institutional Accreditation

In the United States, accreditation is a process through which an institution subjects itself to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an institution, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that an institution&#8217;s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to meet its educational mission.

Pursuant to provisions of the Higher Education Act, ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions&#8217; educational programs qualify the institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. The Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations specify certain standards that all recognized accrediting agencies must adopt in connection with their review of postsecondary institutions. All of our campuses are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by ED.

Campuses in our University Group are accredited by The Higher Learning Commission ( www.hlcommission.org ). American InterContinental University&#8217;s next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2023-24, with its next comprehensive evaluation in 

2017-18. Colorado Technical University&#8217;s next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2022-23, with its next comprehensive evaluation in 2016-17. 

Our Transitional Group and Culinary Arts campuses, which are in teach-out, are also institutionally accredited as listed below through their expected closure date. Many are subject to supplemental reporting requirements so that the relevant accrediting agency may monitor student achievement outcomes and the financial position of these campuses. Any regulator sanctions regarding outcomes for these campuses will not take effect since the programs are already in teach-out, which is typically the required action for failure to achieve a minimum standard within the specific time period.

Programmatic Accreditation 

In addition to the institutional accreditations described above, a number of our institutions have specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals who must pass professional license exams to have graduated from accredited programs. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by ED, provides additional quality review by peers in a given field and may enable or assist graduates to practice, sit for licensing or certification exams (in some cases) or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. In addition to programmatic accreditation, some states have licensing boards which regulate who in a state is licensed to practice in a given profession.

Career Education pursues programmatic accreditation if said accreditation is required by employers or licensing bodies in order for a graduate to practice the profession or if it is required in order for a graduate to sit for a licensing or certification exam in order to practice or advance in the profession. In some cases, programmatic accreditation is sought because it is desired by employers and may enhance the ability of our graduates to compete for employment in their field.

Programmatic accreditation has been granted by the following accrediting agencies for the following individual programs offered by our University Group institutions. Programmatic accreditation is also held by certain programs offered by campuses in the Tra nsitional Group and Culinary Arts (all of which are in teach-out), but is not included in the table below.

Status as of February 15, 2016.

State Authorization

&#160;

State licensing agencies are responsible for the oversight of educational institutions, and continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates to its students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, and financial policies. State laws and regulations may limit our campuses&#8217; ability to operate or to award degrees or diplomas or offer new degree programs. Moreover, under the Higher Education Act, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. As a result, we are subject to regulation in the states where our physical campuses are located, and our online institutions are also subject to regulation in certain other states in which they enroll and/or recruit students. Currently, each of our ground-based campuses is authorized by the state in which it is located. Additionally, our online institutions have sought confirmation of an exemption, separate state approval or recognition from the relevant state agency via participation in a consortia program called the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (&#8220;SARA&#8221;) in the states in which they enroll and/or recruit students.

&#160;

SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. States, districts and territories apply to become members of SARA (which, in many cases, requires action by state legislators) and if accepted, institutions approved in their &#8220;home&#8221; state may apply to become participants in the SARA compact and the &#8220;home&#8221; state authorization is deemed acceptable to operate an online program in other states that also participate in SARA as long as they do not establish a &#8220;physical presence&#8221; in those other states (as defined by SARA). As of January 1, 2016, 36 states are SARA participants with additional states moving towards applying for membership ( www.nc-sara.org ). During 2015, AIU and CTU were approved to participate in SARA by their home states (Illinois and Colorado, respectively). For those states that have not adopted laws to participate in SARA, local rules and thresholds for licensure apply. 

&#160;

In the past, ED has sought to increase state oversight imposed on Title IV participating institutions providing distance learning by conditioning Title IV participation for students residing in a state on whether that state maintained acceptable oversight of each institution. The enforceability of these regulations was successfully challenged in court and ED has subsequently delayed plans for re-issuing revised regulations addressing multi-state approval of distance learning programs.

Additional State Regulatory Matters

Over the past several years, states have increased their focus on the private, postsecondary education sector. This includes increased activity by state attorneys general in their review of the sector. In this regard, we have several pending inquiries by state attorneys general. See Note 13 &#8220;Contingencies &#8211; State Investigations&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these inquiries.

Additionally, on August 19, 2013, the Company entered into an Assurance of Discontinu ance with the New York Attorney General. Under the terms of this agreement, without admitting or denying any findings by the New York Attorney General, the Company agreed to, among other things: calculate and disclose placement rates according to agreed up on procedures and retain an independent consultant or audit firm to independently verify and report on such placement rates and to teach out programs going forward that do not achieve a 47.5% minimum placement rate. The Company&#8217;s Transitional Group campuse s in New York as well as AIU Online and CTU Online have each reported and published this additional agreed upon placement rate which, in the case of AIU Online and CTU Online, only includes New York resident graduates. For the 2015 reporting year, none of the rates required to be calculated for AIU Online and CTU Online were below the minimum threshold required by the Assurance of Discontinuance. The Company&#8217;s Transitional Group campuses in New York are all in teach-out and therefore no further action shoul d be necessary with respect to programs which report rates below the minimum threshold. 

STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND RELATED FEDERAL REGULATION

Many of our students require assistance in financing their education. Our institutions are approved to participate in the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Title IV federal aid programs. Our institutions also participate in a number of state financial aid programs, tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces, education benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and other alternative funding sources. Our institutions that participate in federal and state financial aid programs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state government agencies, and other standards imposed by educational accrediting bodies.

Nature of Federal Support for Postsecondary Education in the United States

The U.S. government provides a substantial portion of its support for postsecondary education in the form of Title IV Program grants, loans and work-study programs to students who can use those funds to finance certain education related expenses at any institution that has been approved to participate by ED. These federal programs are authorized by the Higher Education Act. While most students are eligible for a Title IV loan, more generally, financial aid administered under Title IV is awarded on the basis of financial need, which is generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the costs associated with attending an institution and the amount a student&#8217;s family can reasonably be expected to contribute based on a federally determined formula. Among other things, recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study.

Students at our institutions may receive grants, loans and work-study opportunities to fund their education under the Title IV Programs described in the sections below. In addition, some students at our institutions receive education related benefits pursuant to certain programs for veterans and military personnel, the most significant of which are described further below.

Federal Student and Parent Loans

ED&#8217;s major form of aid includes loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (&#8220;Direct Loan&#8221;) Program. Direct Loans are loans made directly by the U.S. Government to students or their parents. The Direct Loan program offers Federal Direct Stafford, Federal Direct PLUS (which provides loans to parents of dependent students and to graduate or professional students, known as Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS) and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. 

Direct Loans are loans made to our students directly from the federal government. Undergraduate students who have demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan, with ED paying the interest on this loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in school. Graduate and undergraduate students who do not demonstrate financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Graduate/professional students may only receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans. With Direct Unsubsidized Loans the student is responsible for the interest while in school and after leaving school, although actual interest payments generally may be deferred by the student until after he or she has left school. Students who are eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan may also be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

A student is not required to meet any specific credit scoring criteria to receive a Direct Loan, but any student with a default on a prior loan made under any Title IV Program or who has been convicted under federal or state law of selling or possessing drugs while receiving federal aid may not be eligible. ED has established maximum annual and aggregate borrowing limits for Direct Subsidized / Unsubsidized Loans.

The Direct PLUS Loan Program provides loans to either the parents of dependent students (Direct Parent PLUS) or to graduate students (Direct Grad PLUS). Parents and graduate students who have an acceptable credit history may borrow a Direct PLUS Loan to pay the education related expenses of a child who is a dependent (Direct Parent PLUS) or a graduate student (Direct Grad PLUS) enrolled at least half-time at our eligible institutions. The amount of a Direct PLUS Loan cannot exceed the student&#8217;s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received.

The Federal Perkins Loan Program (&#8220;Perkins Lo ans&#8221;) is made from a revolving institutional Federal Perkins Fund account. The federal and institutional percentages of that account were determined by legislation in place at the time the institution received federal allocations. The educational instituti on&#8217;s contribution was at least one-third of the Federal Capital Contribution from ED. Each institution is responsible for award determination, disbursements, collections and servicing of the Federal Perkins Loans. Currently, only CTU participates in the Fe deral Perkins Loan program. This program initially sunset on September 30, 2015; however, President Obama recently signed legislation extending the life of the program. This program is now scheduled to end by September 30, 2017. 

Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant

Title IV Program grants are generally made to our students under the Federal Pell Grant (&#8220;Pell Grant&#8221;) program and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (&#8220;FSEOG&#8221;) program. The 2015-16 maximum annual Pell Grant is $5,775. The FSEOG program awards are designed to supplement Pell Grants up to a maximum amount of $4,000 per academic year for the neediest students. Our institutions are required to provide matching funding for FSEOG awards that represent not less than 25% of the total FSEOG award to be received by eligible students. The matching may be accomplished through institutional, private and/or state funds.

Federal Work-Study Program

Generally, under the federal work-study program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students to perform work for the institution or certain off-campus organizations. The remaining 25% is paid by the institution or the student&#8217;s employer. In select cases, these federal funds under the federal work-study program are used to pay up to 100% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students.

Veteran&#8217;s Benefits Programs

Some of our students who are veterans use their benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, as amended (&#8220;Post-9/11 GI Bill&#8221;), to cover their tuition. A certain number of our students are also eligible to receive funds from other education assistance programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Post-9/11 GI Bill Yellow Ribbon expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, including reservists and members of the National Guard. As originally passed, the Post-9/11 GI Bill provided that eligible veterans could receive benefits for tuition purposes up to the cost of in-state tuition at the most expensive public institution of higher education in the state where the veteran was enrolled. In addition, veterans who were enrolled in classroom-based programs or &#8220;blended programs&#8221; (programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning) could receive monthly housing stipends, while veterans enrolled in wholly distance-based programs were not entitled to a monthly housing stipend. The provisions regarding education benefits for post-9/11 veterans took effect August 1, 2009. The Post-9/11 GI Bill also increased the amount of education benefits available to eligible veterans under the pre-existing Montgomery GI Bill. The legislation also authorized expansion of service members&#8217; ability to transfer veterans&#8217; education benefits to family members.

On January 4, 2011, President Obama signed the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 (&#8220;Improvements Act&#8221;) which amends the Post-9/11 GI Bill in several pertinent respects. The Improvements Act alters the way benefits related to tuition and fees are calculated. For nonpublic U.S. institutions, the Improvements Act bases the benefits related to tuition and fees on the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance paid directly to the institution for the sole purpose of defraying tuition cost) rather than the charges established by the institution, and it replaces the state-dependent benefit cap with a single national cap which is adjusted annually and as of August 1, 2015 is $21,085. In addition, veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance learning on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive up to 50% of the national average of the basic housing allowance available to service members who are at military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Most &#8220;Improvements Act&#8221; changes took effect on August 1 or October 1, 2011, though changes to rules regarding eligibility for benefits were effective immediately or retroactively to the effective date of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Improvements Act did not change the Post-9/11 GI Bill&#8217;s provision that allows veterans to receive up to $1,000 per academic year for books, supplies, equipment and other education costs. In March 2012, the Department of Veteran Affairs changed the Yellow Ribbon Agreement to an open ended agreement.

Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;). Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at postsecondary institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by ED. Each branch of the armed forces has established its own rules for the tuition assistance programs of DoD.

In 2010, both the U.S. Congress and DoD increased their focus on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at for-profit institutions. The DoD Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) was established as part of the revised DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs dated March 15, 2011. The MOU increases oversight of educational programs offered to active duty service members and conveys the commitments and agreements between the 

educational institution and DoD prio r to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program. For example, the MOU requires an institution to agree to support DoD regulatory guidance, adhere to a bill of rights that is specified in the regulations, and participate in the proposed Military V oluntary Education Review program. Under the MOU, institutions must also agree to adhere to the principles and criteria established by the Service Members Opportunity Colleges Degree Network System regarding the transferability of credit and the awarding o f credit for military training and experience. Institutions were required to sign the MOU by March 30, 2012. After March 1, 2013 institutions without a signed DoD MOU cannot enroll service members under the tuition assistance program until they have signed the MOU. Our institutions utilizing tuition assistance have signed DoD&#8217;s standard MOU. 

In August 2013, DoD began incorporating the Principles of Excellence outlined in the President&#8217;s 2012 Executive Order into their current MOU. Refer to the section below for more information on the Principles of Excellence.

In May 2014, DoD released a final version of its revised MOU and its changes include efforts to enhance departmental oversight of voluntary education programs as well as incorporate the remaining requirements as stated in the President's Executive Order 13607. The new provisions apply to all educational institutions providing education programs through the DoD tuition assistance program. Among other things, the MOU requests that participating institutions provide meaningful information to students about the financial cost and attendance at an institution so military students can make informed decisions on where to attend school, will not use unfair, deceptive, and abusive recruiting practices and will provide academic and student support services to service members and their families. The revised MOU also implemented rules to strengthen existing procedures for access to DoD installations by educational institutions, a DoD postsecondary education complaint system for service members, spouses, and adult family members to register student complaints and established authorization for the military departments to establish service-specific tuition assistance eligibility criteria and management controls. In September 2014, our institutions utilizing tuition assistance signed DoD&#8217;s revised MOU.

2012 Executive Order Regarding Military and Veterans Education Benefits

On April 27, 2012, President Obama issued an executive order regarding the establishment of Principles of Excellence for educational institutions receiving funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs, including those provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the DoD. The executive order requires DoD, the Department of Veterans Affairs and ED to establish and implement &#8220;Principles of Excellence&#8221; to apply to educational institutions receiving such funding. The goals of the Principles are broadly stated in the order and relate to disclosures of costs and amounts of costs covered by federal educational benefits, marketing standards, state authorization, accreditation approvals, standard institutional refund policies, educational plans and academic and financial advising. Various implementation mechanisms are included, along with the development and implementation of the &#8220;VA Shopping Sheet,&#8221; a standardized cost form with federal aid information. While additional administrative support has been required to comply with the executive order, the overall impact to the Company has not been material.

Alternative Student Financial Aid Sources

A financial institution providing a non-recourse loan assumes 100% of the credit risk on the loan. The student, or the student and a co-borrower, must meet the credit criteria established by the financial institution to receive these loans. Each financial institution establishes its own credit criteria and loan limits. Students and co-borrowers generally can borrow an amount equal to the student&#8217;s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received. Currently, with the exception of a few regional markets, non-recourse loans are not available to students attending our institutions. In addition, CEC does not participate in any recourse loan programs. In November of 2012, Sallie Mae discontinued offering new non-recourse private student loans to students attending our institutions. Sallie Mae has committed, however, to providing access to private loans for students actively attending such that they could continue to receive funding through the remainder of their program. Less than 0.1% of our 2015 cash receipts came from private lending sources. We anticipate a similar amount of our 2016 cash receipts will come from these sources.

Due to tightening lending standards, in 2008 we started offering funding alternatives for eligible students in place of a recourse program that had previously been provided by Sallie Mae. We decided to provide extended payment plans directly to certain students to ensure that they could finish their current educational programs with us and to allow new students the opportunity to attend our institutions. In early 2011, we discontinued our internal extended financing program. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $2.2 million outstanding related to our extended payment plan programs as reflected in our current and non-current student receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, on our consolidated balance sheet.

Eligibility and Certification by ED

&#160;

Under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, an institution must apply to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control. In addition, an institution must obtain ED approval for certain substantial changes in its operations, including changes in an institution&#8217;s accrediting agency or state authorizing agency or changes to an institution&#8217;s structure or certain basic educational features.

&#160;

Institutions approved to participate in Title IV sign a program participation agreement provided by ED that describes the terms of participation and includes a number of certifications and assurances made by the chief executive officer. As long as an institution 

has submitted an application for re-certification prior to the expiration of its current program participation agreement, the institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs continues on a month-to-month basis until ED completes its re view. ED may issue full certification to an institution, it may deny certification or it may elect to issue provisional certification, in which case the program participation agreement outlines additional requirements that the institution must meet. 

&#160;

ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards. Provisional certification does not generally limit an institution&#8217;s access to Title IV Program funds. ED may withdraw an institution&#8217;s provisional certification without advance notice if ED determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements.

&#160;

All of our institutions, including AIU and CTU, are in the recertification process and are, therefore, operating on month-to-month continuing program participation agreements. Many have been operating on a month-to-month basis for some time, pending ED taking action on timely submitted recertification applications. In addition, several of our Career School institutions which are in teach-out are currently on provisional certification. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate &#8211; If ED denies, or significantly conditions, recertification of any of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted,&#8221; and other risk factors in Item 1A for additional information about the risks surrounding continued participation in Title IV Programs.

Increased Scrutiny of the For-Profit, Postsecondary Education Sector

In recent years, Congress, ED, states, accrediting agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), state attorneys general and the media have increased their scrutiny of the for-profit, postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution&#8217;s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities and include a number of recommendations to be considered by Congress in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. A group of influential U.S. senators has strongly and repeatedly encouraged ED and the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to take action to limit or terminate the participation of institutions such as ours in existing tuition assistance programs. 

In addition, ED has formed an inter-agency task force focused on the private, postsecondary education sector involving multiple federal agencies and departments, including the FTC, the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and numerous state attorneys general, to coordinate activities and share information to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive policies and practices. 

We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future. Any actions that limit our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would negatively impact our business. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate &#8211; Increased scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector by Congress, the President and various state and federal governmental agencies have resulted in adverse publicity and increased regulatory burdens and costs, and this trend may continue or intensify.&#8221; 

Legislative Action and Recent ED Regulatory Initiatives

The U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program.

The Higher Education Opportunity Act (&#8220;HEOA&#8221;) was the most recent reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and was signed into law on August 14, 2008. It was immediately effective for many items with others effective in subsequent years. The HEOA authorized increases in the Federal Pell Grants, changed certain grant eligibility requirements, expanded Stafford Loan deferment options, provided changes to needs analysis, changed treatment of Veterans Administration benefits effective with the 2010-11 award year and revised many of the regulations governing an institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.

By law, the Higher Education Act must be reauthorized by Congress every five years. The last full reauthorization took place in 2008, which means that the next reauthorization was due in 2013. Congress failed to pass an on-time reauthorization bill; therefore an automatic one-year extension to December 2014 was established. In late 2014, Congress passed an extension to further delay reauthorization. Congress must continue to pass legislation to extend the Act until a reauthorization can occur. We anticipate that Congress will work to either reauthorize the Higher Education Act in its entirety or pass a series of smaller bills that focus on individual parts of the Higher Education Act, primarily Title IV Programs. Already we have seen legislation introduced that is focused on simplifying both access to and repayment of Title IV funds. Simplifying the federal student aid programs and reducing the complexity of repayment should be of benefit to our students. However, increased scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in 

connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Educati on Act, and many of these changes may be adverse to postsecondary institutions generally or for-profit institutions specifically. 

Program Integrity and Improvement

In recent years, ED has engaged in rulemaking discussions intended to develop new regulations focused on various topics. The negotiated rulemaking committee established to address program integrity and improvement issues for the federal student aid programs met four times from February through May 2014. Topics for discussion included clock-to-credit-hour conversion, state authorization (distance education and foreign institutions), cash management, retaking coursework and the definition of adverse credit for Direct PLUS loan eligibility. At their final meeting in May of 2014, the taskforce agreed on only four out of six topics negotiated. Because the team failed to reach consensus on all items, ED had discretion to develop its own regulatory language for comment.

On August 8, 2014, ED published proposed regulations to update eligibility standards and improve access for student and parent borrowers under the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program. Final rules were published on October 23, 2014 updating the standard for determining if a potential parent or student borrower has an adverse credit history for purposes of eligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan. These regulations also require parents and students who have an adverse credit history, but who are approved for a Direct PLUS loan on the basis that extenuating circumstances exist or by obtaining an endorser for the loan, to receive loan counseling before receiving the loan. These rules went into effect July 1, 2015; however, ED allowed early implementation of the new criteria as early as March 29, 2015. The increase in administrative burden under these new regulations has not had a material effect on our business.

On October 30, 2015, ED published program integrity and improvement final regulations on three items: cash management of Title IV federal student aid funds, which includes the use of stored value cards and issuing Title IV credit balances; clarification on the treatment of previously passed coursework for Title IV eligibility purposes; and simplification of the requirements for programs that must be treated like clock hour programs for the purposes of Title IV aid assessment. These new regulations remove the institutional authority to reserve, with student authorization, any Title IV credit balance for future allowable education related charges in the applicable award year for schools that are placed on Heightened Cash Monitoring. In addition, the regulations require the institution to issue a Title IV credit balance to the student prior to drawdown of funding from ED. As a result, the new regulations may result in an adverse impact on our overall bad debt expense and certain regulatory metrics; however, at this time, we are unable to predict the magnitude of the impact. The new rules also define arrangements between an institution and a third-party servicer or financial institution when performing functions associated with processing direct payments of Title IV funds. The rules prohibit an institution from requiring students to obtain an access device into which their credit balances must be deposited and provides strict guidance on the marketing practices and methods in which students are presented choices to receive direct payments of Title IV funds if issued through an access device. These regulations will require CEC to adjust the method in which we provide refund options to our students. In addition, ED provides clarification on specific instances where schools may include (or bundle) the cost of books and supplies with tuition charges. To continue this practice, institutions must have a cost effective arrangement with a publisher for students to receive books and supplies at or below market cost, provide a way for students to obtain books and supplies by the seventh day of the term and include a way for a student to &#8216;opt out&#8217; of the institution&#8217;s method for receiving books and supplies. We are reviewing our current bundling practices and evaluating whether they meet these criteria. Any required changes may impact our reported revenue; however, at this time, we are unable to quantify the potential impact. These regulations will be effective July 1, 2016. 

Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations

To be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and regulations thereunder that are administered by ED. We and our institutions are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, investigations, claims of non-compliance, and lawsuits by ED and federal and state regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, present and former students and employees, and others that may allege violations of statutes, regulations, accreditation standards or other regulatory requirements applicable to us or our institutions. If the results of any such audits, reviews, investigations, claims or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, operational limitations, loss of federal funding, injunctions, additional oversight and reporting, provisional certification or other civil or criminal penalties. In addition, if ED or another regulatory agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the Higher Education Act or ED&#8217;s regulations, that institution could be required to repay such funds, and could be assessed an administrative fine.

We have several such matters pending at one or more of our institutions. See Note 13 &#8220;Contingencies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of certain of these matters, including that in December 2011 ED moved all of our institutions from what is called the Advance Method of Payment of Title IV funds to what is called Heightened Cash Monitoring 1, or HCM1, status. Although our prior practices substantially conformed to the requirements of this more restrictive method of drawing down students&#8217; Title IV Program funds, if ED finds violations of the Higher Education Act or related regulations, ED may impose monetary or program level sanctions, or transfer our institutions to the &#8220;reimbursement&#8221; or Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (&#8220;HCM2&#8221;) method of payment of Title IV Program funds, which would result in a significant delay in receiving those funds.

&#160;

In July 2015, ED conducted an ordinary course on-site program review of AIU&#8217;s administration of Title IV Programs in w hich the institution participates. The review covered the 2014-2015 award year with a specific focus on the programs the institution offers via distance education. We have remained responsive to any information requests from ED in this regard; however, we have not yet received the initial program review report. 

&#160;

In November 2015, we were notified by ED that, with the assistance of an external accounting firm, it was going to conduct an assessment of CEC&#8217;s compliance with the Student Right to Know Act. The review generally covers all CEC institutions with active OPEIDs and several institutions with OPEIDS for schools that we have closed or sold, but that had graduates and reported placement rates for the cohort under review. The notification included a request for an extensive volume of information related to placement and graduation rates for the cohort of students graduating between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014, together with supporting documentation for reported placements, policies and procedures for collecting and reporting placement information, required website program disclosures, information related to student complaints, employees responsible for placement tracking and reporting and advertising materials. We have provided ED and its accounting firm with the requested information and believe its review is ongoing. We believe this type of compliance assessment is a new type of review ED is performing on institutions and therefore we cannot predict the scope, duration or process that will be followed for the review. 

The Higher Education Act also requires that an institution&#8217;s administration of Title IV Program funds be audited annually by an independent accounting firm and that the resulting audit report be submitted to ED for review.

Gainful Employment

CEC institutions, and most other for-profit institutions, qualify for Title IV Program participation on the basis that they offer programs that, in addition to meeting other requirements, &#8220;prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.&#8221; During 2013 ED established negotiated rulemaking committees, one specifically to address gainful employment in a recognized occupation, and on October 30, 2014, ED published a new complex final regulation, effective July 1, 2015, to define &#8220;gainful employment,&#8221; a term used in the Higher Education Act which historically has not been defined by Congress or ED. The new definition establishes a formula by which ED will determine if a program is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs. The regulation requires graduates of programs within three years (or less) beyond graduation to, on average, have debt with annual loan payments that are less than 8% of their annual earnings or 20% of their discretionary income. Programs whose graduates have debt with annual loan payments that accounts for between 8% and 12% of their annual earnings, or between 20% and 30% of their discretionary income, will be considered to be in the &#8220;zone&#8221; for meeting the gainful employment standard. Programs whose graduates have debt with annual loan payments that are greater than 12% of annual earnings or 30% of discretionary income will fail the gainful employment test. Institutions with a program that fails to meet the gainful employment test for two out of three years, or that either fail or are in the zone for three out of four years, lose eligibility for that program to participate in Title IV Programs for at least three years. Institutions with a program that is within a year of potentially disqualifying for participation must notify current and prospective students of the program of its potential loss of access to Title IV Program funds and the plan for continuation of the program or refunding tuition to students should the program fail to pass the gainful employment threshold in the subsequent year.

Under the new regulation, debt is calculated based on the lesser of actual median or mean debt, or the cost of tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment. For the first five to seven years after ED begins to report gainful employment results, depending upon the length of the academic program, ED will substitute for the average debt of the measurement cohort the average debt of the most recent graduating cohort. Earnings are based on data to be provided by the Social Security Administration. Institutions will have an opportunity to review and correct the list of students who will be submitted to the Social Security Administration for the earnings query, but will not have an opportunity to inspect, review, question or appeal the results provided.

The gainful employment regulation includes a requirement that institutions disclose program level cohort default rates if directed to do so by ED.

The new regulation includes significant new disclosure requirements and creates additional certifications to which the chief executive officer must attest, including that the programs offered by the institution meet the requirements of states or professional licensing bodies in order for graduates to practice in the field.

We believe that certain of our culinary arts and art &#38; design programs that are in teach-out have the greatest risk of losing Title IV eligibility under the new gainful employment eligibility test, and that our programs within our University segments are more likely to pass. However, we are closely monitoring a few programs within our University Group that we believe will be close to the regulatory thresholds for passing and we are working to launch new programs within our University business that we believe are likely to have positive gainful employment outcomes. There can be no assurance that our actions will result in compliance and the regulation could adversely affect the eligibility of the programs we offer. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate - ED&#8217;s gainful employment regulations may limit the programs we can offer students and increase our cost of operations,&#8221; for more information about risks associated with the gainful employment regulation.

&#8220;90-10 Rule&#8221; 

Under a provision of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;90-10 Rule,&#8221; any of our institutions that, on modified cash basis accounting, derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. If an institution does not satisfy the 90-10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years, it will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for at least two fiscal years. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. If an institution violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, ED could require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.

We have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institution&#8217;s cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs; the use of externally funded scholarships and grants; counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary Title IV Program borrowing; and, for certain campuses, increasing the level of accredited non-Title IV Programs in our institutions.

The ability of our institutions to maintain 90-10 rates below 90% will depend on the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90-10 rate calculation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, the technical aspects of the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the 90-10 Rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the 90-10 Rule.

For our 2015 fiscal year, our preliminary review of our institutions&#8217; 90-10 Rule percentages results in none of our institutions exceeding the 90% limit.

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate &#8211; Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high,&#8221; for additional information regarding risks relating to the 90-10 Rule.

Student Loan Default Rates 

An institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs if the rates at which its former students default on the repayment of their federally-guaranteed or federally-funded student loans exceed specified percentages. This is determined by an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate which is calculated on an annual basis as a measure of administrative capability. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). Previously the cohort default rate was measured on a two year period. The 2011 cohort was the last cohort to be measured under the two-year period and was published in September of 2013. As discussed below, the measurement period for the cohort default rate has transitioned to three years starting with the 2009 cohort. 

Under the current three year measurement period if an educational institution&#8217;s cohort default rate exceeds 10% for any one of the three preceding years, it must delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate program. As a matter of regular practice, all of our institutions have implemented a 30-day delay for such disbursements.

Beginning with the 2009 cohort, if an institution&#8217;s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate. 

Beginning with the three-year cohort default rate for the 2011 cohort published in September 2014, only the three-year rates will be applied for purposes of measuring compliance with the requirements and imposing sanctions, as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

Annual test . If the three-year cohort default rate for any given year exceeds 40%, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Three consecutive years test . If the institution&#8217;s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2009 cohort, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs. 

We have student loan default management initiatives at all of our institutions that participate in Title IV Programs aimed at reducing the likelihood of our students&#8217; failure to repay their loans in a timely manner. These initiatives emphasize the importance of students&#8217; compliance with loan repayment requirements and provide for loan counseling and communication with students after they cease enrollment.

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate &#8211; Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by ED,&#8221; for additional information regarding risks relating to cohort default rates.

In September 2015, ED released the official three-year cohort default rates for the 2012 cohort. For the 2012 cohort, no CEC institution h ad official rates in excess of the 30% threshold, including our Career Schools which are in teach-out. A listing of the official 2012, 2011 and 2010 three-year cohort default rates, for our universities is provided in the table below.

Financial Responsibility Standards

To participate in Title IV Programs, our institutions must either satisfy standards of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV Programs. Pursuant to the Title IV Program regulations, each eligible higher education institution must, among other things, satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of three annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution. The three tests measure primary reserve, equity and net income ratios. The Primary Reserve Ratio is a measure of an institution&#8217;s financial viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio is a measure of an institution&#8217;s capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio is a measure of an institution&#8217;s profitability. These tests provide three individual scores that are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. A composite score from 1.0 to 1.4 is considered to be in &#8220;the zone&#8221; of financial responsibility, and a composite score of less than 1.0 is not considered to be financially responsible. If an institution is in &#8220;the zone&#8221; of financial responsibility, the institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in Title IV Programs on the following alternative bases:

&#160;

&#183; 

Zone Alternative . Under what is referred to as the &#8220;zone alternative,&#8221; an institution may continue to participate in Title IV Programs for up to three years under additional monitoring and reporting procedures but without having to post a letter of credit in favor of ED. These additional monitoring and reporting procedures include being transferred from the &#8220;advance&#8221; method of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status (referred to as Heightened Cash Monitoring 1, or HCM1, status) or to the &#8220;reimbursement&#8221; or Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (&#8220;HCM2&#8221;) methods of payment. If an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0 in one of the three subsequent years or does not improve its financial condition to attain a composite score of at least 1.5 by the end of the three-year period, the institution must satisfy another alternative standard to continue participating in Title IV Programs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Letter of Credit Alternative . An institution that fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to ED in an amount equal to at least 50% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Provisional Certification . If an institution fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, ED may permit the institution to participate under provisional certification for up to three years. If ED permits an institution to participate under provisional certification, an institution must comply with the requirements of the &#8220;zone alternative,&#8221; including being transferred to the HCM1, HCM2 or &#8220;reimbursement&#8221; method of payment of Title IV Program funds, and must submit a letter of credit to ED in an amount determined by ED which can range from 10%-100% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year. If an institution is still not financially responsible at the end of the period of provisional certification, including because it has a composite score of less than 1.0, ED may again permit provisional certification subject to the terms ED determines appropriate. 

ED applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on an institution&#8217;s audited financial statements and may apply the tests if an institution undergoes a change in control or under other circumstances. ED also may apply the tests to the parent company of our institutions, and to other related entities. Recent profitability declines and the write down of the carrying value of non-financial assets, such as deferred tax assets and goodwill, have negatively impacted our financial responsibility composite scores. Our composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 1.5, and our preliminary calculation for the year ended December 31, 2015 is 1.7, which are considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. Our financial responsibility ratio for 2015 benefits from the partial reversal during the year ended December 31, 2015 of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. Future profitability declines as compared to projected amounts, as well as changes 

in estimates regarding expectations of future taxable income or the timing of future taxable income, could impact our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or goodwill balances in future periods, which could negatively impact our financial responsibility ratio. If in the future we are required to satisfy ED&#8217;s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis, including potentially by posti ng irrevocable letters of credit, we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit. 

Accreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility, and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from the ED requirements. Any developments relating to our satisfaction of ED&#8217;s financial responsibility requirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements.

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate &#8211; A failure to demonstrate &#8216;financial responsibility&#8217; or &#8216;administrative capability&#8217; would have negative impacts on our operations ,&#8221; for additional information regarding risks relating to the financial responsibility standards.

Return and Refunds of Title IV Program Funds

An institution participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that were disbursed to students who withdrew from educational programs before completing the programs, and must return those funds in a timely manner.

The portion of tuition and registration fee payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets, as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year. If a student withdraws from one of our institutions prior to the completion of the academic term or program period, we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that we are not entitled to retain, pursuant to applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards and our refund policy. The amount of funds to be refunded on behalf of a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and registration fees paid by the student as of the student&#8217;s withdrawal date. Such refunds typically result in a reduction to deferred tuition revenue and cash on our consolidated balance sheets, because generally, we do not recognize tuition revenue in our consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) until related refund provisions have lapsed.

Institutions are required to return any unearned Title IV funds within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. An institution that is found to be in non-compliance with ED refund requirements for either of the last two completed fiscal years must post a letter of credit in favor of ED in an amount equal to 25% of the total Title IV Program returns that were paid or should have been paid by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year. As of December 31, 2015, we have posted no letters of credit in favor of ED due to non-compliance with ED refund requirements.

Change of Ownership or Control

When an institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as that term is defined by the state in which it is located, its accrediting agency and ED, it must secure the approval of those agencies to continue to operate and to continue to participate in Title IV Programs. If the institution is unable to re-establish state authorization and accreditation requirements and satisfy other requirements for certification by ED, the institution may lose its authority to operate and its ability to participate in Title IV Programs. An institution whose change of ownership or control is approved by the appropriate authorities is nonetheless provisionally re-certified by ED for a period of up to three years. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control by one or more of the applicable regulatory agencies, including ED, applicable state agencies, and accrediting bodies, include the acquisition of an institution from another entity or significant acquisition or disposition of an institution&#8217;s equity. It is possible that some of these events may occur without our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, a required approval of any change in control from ED, applicable state agencies, or accrediting agencies could impair our ability or the ability of the affected institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. If we were to undergo a change of control and a material number of our institutions failed to obtain the required approvals from applicable regulatory agencies in a timely manner, our student population, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

When we acquire an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by ED. Each of our acquired institutions has undergone a certification review under our ownership and has been certified to participate in Title IV Programs on a provisional basis, per ED requirements, until such time that ED signs a new program participation agreement with the institution. Currently, none of our institutions are subject to provisional certification status due to ED&#8217;s change of ownership criteria. The potential adverse effects of a change of control under ED regulations may influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our common stock.

Opening New Institutions, Start-up Campuses and Adding Educational Programs

The Higher Education Act generally requires that for-profit institutions be fully operational for two years before applying to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish a start-up 

branch campus or location and participate in Title IV Programs at the start-up campus without re ference to the two-year requirement if the start-up campus has received all of the necessary state and accrediting agency approvals, has been reported to ED, and meets certain other criteria as defined by ED. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, a st art-up branch campus may also be required to obtain approval from ED to be able to participate in Title IV Programs. 

In addition to ED regulations, certain of the state and accrediting agencies with jurisdiction over our institutions have requirements that may affect our ability to open a new institution, open a start-up branch campus or location of one of our existing institutions, or begin offering a new educational program at one of our institutions. If we establish a new institution, add a new branch start-up campus, or expand program offerings at any of our institutions without obtaining the required approvals, we would likely be liable for repayment of Title IV Program funds provided to students at that institution or branch campus or enrolled in that educational program, and we could also be subject to sanctions. Also, if we are unable to obtain the approvals from ED, applicable state regulatory agencies, and accrediting agencies for any new institutions, branch campuses, or program offerings where such approvals are required, or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, our ability to grow our business would be impaired and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Administrative Capability

ED regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV Programs. These criteria relate to, among other things, institutional staffing, operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV Program funds, timely submission of accurate reports to ED and various other procedural matters. If an institution fails to satisfy any of ED&#8217;s criteria for administrative capability, ED may require the repayment of Title IV Program funds disbursed by the institution, place the institution on provisional certification status, require the institution to receive Title IV Program funds under another funding arrangement, impose fines or limit or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.

Restrictions on Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments

An institution participating in Title IV Programs cannot provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or Title IV financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. New regulations issued in October 2010 which became effective July 1, 2011 rescinded previously issued ED guidance and &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; relied upon by higher education institutions in making decisions how they managed, compensated and promoted individuals engaged in student recruiting and the awarding of financial aid and their supervisors. The elimination of these &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; protections and guidance required us to terminate certain compensation payments to our affected employees and to implement changes in contractual and other arrangements with third parties to change structures formerly allowed under ED rules, and has had an impact on our ability to compensate, recruit, retain and motivate affected admissions and other affected employees as well as on our business arrangements with third-party lead generators and other marketing vendors.

Further, ED provided very limited published guidance regarding this rule and does not establish clear criteria for compliance for many circumstances. If ED determined that an institution&#8217;s compensation practices violated these standards, ED could subject the institution to monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions.

Substantial Misrepresentation

The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with ED. Under ED&#8217;s rules, a "misrepresentation" is any statement (made in writing, visually, orally or otherwise) made by the institution, any of its representatives or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution, that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive, and a "substantial misrepresentation" is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person&#8217;s detriment. Considering the broad definition of &#8220;substantial misrepresentation,&#8221; it is possible that, despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. In addition, ED&#8217;s gainful employment regulation requires the disclosure of select student outcome metrics and includes disclosure of a number of new metrics on institutional websites and during enrollment to all new students. Errors or omissions in these metrics may be used by ED as the basis for a finding of &#8220;substantial misrepresentation.&#8221; If ED determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may revoke the institution&#8217;s program participation agreement, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs; the institution could also be exposed to increased risk of action under the federal False Claims Act.
