 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

GENERAL 

&#160;

The InterGroup Corporation (&#8220;InterGroup&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; and may also be referred to as &#8220;we&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; in this report) is a Delaware corporation formed in 1985, as the successor to Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust (&#34;M-REIT&#34;), a New York real estate investment trust created in 1965. The Company has been a publicly-held company since M-REIT's first public offering of shares in 1966.

&#160;

The Company was organized to buy, develop, operate, rehabilitate and dispose of real property of various types and descriptions, and to engage in such other business and investment activities as would benefit the Company and its shareholders.

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, the Company owned approximately 81.7% of the common shares of Santa Fe Financial Corporation (&#8220;Santa Fe&#8221;), a public company (OTCBB: SFEF). Santa Fe&#8217;s revenue is primarily generated through its 68.8% owned subsidiary, Portsmouth Square, Inc. (&#8220;Portsmouth&#8221;), a public company (OTCBB: PRSI) . InterGroup also directly owns approximately 13.3% of Portsmouth. Portsmouth&#8217;s primary business is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors, a California limited partnership (&#8220;Justice&#8221; or the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;). Portsmouth has a 93% limited partnership interest in Justice and is the sole general partner. The financial statements of Justice are consolidated with those of the Company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

Justice, through its subsidiaries Justice Holdings Company, LLC (&#8220;Holdings&#8221;), a Delaware Limited Liability Company, Justice Operating Company, LLC (&#8220;Operating&#8221;) and Justice Mezzanine Company, LLC (&#8220;Mezzanine&#8221;), owns a 543-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the &#8220;Hotel&#8221; or the &#8220;Property&#8221;) and related facilities including a five level underground parking garage. Holdings and Mezzanine are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating. The Hotel is operated by the Partnership as a full service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton). Justice also has a management agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. (&#8220;Prism&#8221;) to perform management functions for the Hotel. The management agreement with Prism commenced on February 2, 2007 and had an original term of ten years, subject to a right to terminate at any time with or without cause by the Partnership. Effective January 2014, the management agreement with Prism was amended by the Partnership to change the nature of the services provided by Prism and the compensation payable to Prism, among other things. Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management, Inc. (&#8220;GMP&#8221;), a company owned by a Justice limited partner and a related party, began to provide management services for the Partnership pursuant to a management services agreement, with a term of three years, subject to the Partnership&#8217;s right to terminate earlier, for cause. In June 2016, GMP resigned and the Company is currently in discussions with several national third party hotel management companies to replace GMP.

&#160;

The parking garage that is part of the Hotel property is managed by Ace Parking Management, Inc. pursuant to a contract with the Partnership. The parking agreement with Ace Parking was terminated with an effective termination date of October 4, 2016. Going forward, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Street Parking LLC, will manage the parking garage in-house.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership, management and, when appropriate, sale of real estate. Properties include fifteen apartment complexes, one commercial real estate property and three single-family houses. The properties are located throughout the United States, but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has an investment in unimproved real property. As of June 30, 2016, all of the Company&#8217;s operating real estate properties are managed in-house. Beginning August 2014, the Company began managing its properties located outside of California in-house, while the properties located in California with exception to the two commercial properties, were being managed by a third party property management company. In August 2015, the Company terminated its third party property management agreement for the management of the Company&#8217;s properties located in California and began managing the properties in-house going forward. The commercial property is also managed in-house.

&#160;

The Company acquires its investments in real estate and other investments utilizing cash, securities or debt, subject to approval or guidelines of the Board of Directors and its Real Estate Investment Committee. The Company may also look for new real estate investment opportunities in hotels, apartments, office buildings and development properties. The acquisition of any new real estate investments will depend on the Company&#8217;s ability to find suitable investment opportunities and the availability of sufficient financing to acquire such investments. To help fund any such acquisition, the Company may borrow funds to leverage its investment capital. The amount of any such debt will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of financing and the sufficiency of the acquisition property&#8217;s projected cash flows to support the operations and debt service.

&#160;

The Company also derives income from the investment of its cash and investment securities assets. The Company has invested in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and will consider other investments if such investments offer growth or profit potential. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities and other investments.

&#160;

HILTON HOTELS FRANCHISE LICENSE AGREEMENT 

&#160;

The Partnership entered into a Franchise License Agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) with the HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton) on November 24, 2004. The term of the License Agreement was for an initial period of 15 years commencing on the date the Hotel began operating as a Hilton hotel, with an option to extend the License Agreement for another five years, subject to certain conditions. On June 26, 2015, Operating and Hilton entered into an amended franchise agreement that, among other things, extended the License Agreement through 2030, and also provided the Partnership with certain key money cash incentives to be earned through 2030.

&#160;

Since the opening of the Hotel in January 2006, the Partnership has paid monthly royalties, program fees and information technology recapture charges equal to a percentage of the Hotel&#8217;s gross room revenue for the preceding calendar month. Total fees paid to Hilton for such services during fiscal 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $2.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively.

&#160; 

HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY AGREEMENT 

&#160;

On February 2, 2007, the Partnership entered into a management agreement with Prism to manage and operate the Hotel as its agent. The original management agreement was effective for a term of ten years, but was amended in January 2014 as described below. Under the original management agreement, the Partnership was required to pay Prism base management fees of up to 2.5% of gross operating revenues of the Hotel (i.e., room, food and beverage, and other operating departments) for each fiscal year. Of that amount, 1.75% of the gross operating revenues was paid monthly. The balance or 0.75% was payable only to the extent that the partially adjusted net operating income (net operating income less capital expenditures) for the applicable fiscal year exceeded a specified minimum return for the Hotel for the fiscal year ($7 million in fiscal 2013). The base management fee was limited to 1.75% for the period ended January 31, 2014. Under the new management agreement, effective January 2014, the required base management fees were amended by the Partnership to a fixed rate of $20,000 per month. Under the amended management agreement, Prism can also earn an incentive fee of $11,000 for each month that the revenues per room of the Hotel exceed the average revenues per room of a defined set of competing hotels. Base management fees and incentives paid to Prism during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $251,000 and $293,000, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management, Inc. (&#8220;GMP&#8221;), a company owned by a Justice limited partner and related party, began to provide management services for the Partnership pursuant to a management services agreement. The management agreement with GMP had a term of three years, subject to the Partnership&#8217;s right to terminate earlier, for cause. In June 2016, GMP resigned and the Company is currently in discussions with several national third party hotel management companies to replace GMP. Under the agreement, GMP was required to advise the Partnership on the management and operation of the hotel; administer the Partnership&#8217;s contracts, leases, agreements with hotel managers and franchisors and other contracts and agreements; provide administrative and asset management services, oversee financial reporting, and maintain offices at the Hotel in order to facilitate provision of services. GMP was paid an annual base management fee of $325,000 per year, increasing by 5% per year, payable in monthly installments, and was eligible for reimbursement for reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by GMP in performing its obligations under the agreement.

&#160;

During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, GMP was paid $1,637,000 and $1,688,000, respectively, for the salaries, benefits, and local payroll taxes for GMP employees and various other reimbursable expenses. Also included in the $1,637,000, is the $200,000 fee paid to GMP for the completion of the reorganization of the Partnership and the related financing transactions. Total GMP base management fees and reimbursed GMP employee costs expensed during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,219,000 and $1,078,000, respectively, and are included in the consolidated statements of operations.

&#160; 

GARAGE OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

On October 31, 2010, the Partnership and Ace Parking entered into an amendment of their original parking agreement to extend the term for a period of sixty two (62) months, commencing on November 1, 2010 and terminating December 31, 2015, subject to either party&#8217;s right to terminate the agreement without cause on ninety (90) days&#8217; written notice. The monthly management fee of $2,000 and the accounting fee of $250 remained the same, but the amendment modified how the &#8220;Excess Profit Fee&#8221; (as described below) to be paid to Ace Parking would be calculated. Ace Parking is also reimbursed for employee salaries and other reimbursable expenses.

&#160;

The amendment noted above provided that, if net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) from the garage operations exceeded $1,800,000 but was less than $2,000,000, then Ace Parking would be entitled to a fee (the &#8220;Excess Profit Fee&#8221;) of one percent (1%) of the total annual NOI. If the annual NOI was $2,000,000 or higher, Ace Parking would be entitled to an Excess Profit Fee equal to two percent (2%) of the total annual NOI. The garage&#8217;s NOI did not exceed the annual NOI of $2,000,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. The garage&#8217;s NOI exceeded the annual NOI of $2,000,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015. Base management and incentive fees to Ace Parking amounted to $24,000 and $44,000 for each of the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The parking agreement with Ace Parking was terminated with an effective termination date of October 4, 2016. Going forward, the Company will manage the parking garage in-house.

&#160;

CHINESE CULTURE FOUNDATION LEASE 

&#160;

On March 15, 2005, the Partnership entered into an amended lease with the Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;) for the third floor space of the Hotel commonly known as the Chinese Culture Center, which the Foundation had right to occupy pursuant to a 50-year nominal rent lease that began in 1967.

&#160;

The amended lease, among other things, requires the Partnership to pay to the Foundation a monthly event space fee in the amount of $5,000, adjusted annually based on the local Consumer Price Index. The term of the amended lease expires on October 17, 2023, with an automatic extension for another 10 year term if the property continues to be operated as a hotel. Justice agreed further to incorporate the third floor into the renovation of the Hotel resulting in a new ballroom for the joint use of the Hotel and new offices and a gallery for the Chinese Culture Center.

&#160; 

SALES AND REFINANCINGS OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES 

&#160;

In July 2015, the Company purchased a residential house in Los Angeles, California as a strategic asset for $1,975,000 in cash. In August 2016, the Company obtained a $1,000,000 mortgage note payable on this property and received net proceeds of $983,000. The interest on note is 4.50% with interest only payments for twenty three months. The loan matures in August of 2018.

&#160;

In June 2016, the Company refinanced its $1,929,000 mortgage note payable on its 12-unit apartment complex located in Los Angeles, California and obtained a new mortgage in the amount of $2,300,000. The interest rate on the new mortgage is 3.60% and matures in June 2026.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In April 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate agreement on its $923,000 mortgage note payable on its commercial property located in Los Angeles, California in order to settle the variable rate as of March 31, 2016 of 4.22% into a fixed rate of 3.99%, the swap agreement matures in January 2021. A swap is a contractual agreement to exchange interest rate payments.

&#160;

In March 2015, the Company refinanced the $3,636,000 mortgage note payable on its 157-unit property located in Florence, Kentucky for a new mortgage in the amount of $3,492,000. The Company paid down approximately $210,000 of the old mortgage as part of the refinancing. The new mortgage has a fixed interest rate of 3.87% for ten years and matures in April 2025.

&#160;

In February 2014, the Company entered into a contract to sell its 249 unit apartment complex located in Austin, Texas and the adjacent unimproved land for $15,800,000. The purchase/sale agreement provides that purchaser could terminate the agreement with or without cause, however, the potential purchaser would forfeit the earnest money ($208,000) and additional consideration ($250,000) totaling $458,000. The purchaser also had the option to extend the agreement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Company received the $458,000 and recognized it as income as the result of the potential buyer not extending the purchase agreement. In December 2014, the Company entered into a new contract with a different buyer to sell the same property for $16,300,000. In March 2015, the Company sold this property for $16,300,000 and realized a gain on the sale of real estate of $9,358,000.

The Company received net proceeds of $2,163,000 after selling costs and the repayment of the related mortgage of $1,100,000. Prior to its sale, this property was being leased by the buyer.

&#160; 

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICIES 

&#160;

In addition to its Hotel and real estate operations, the Company also invests from time to time in income producing instruments, corporate debt and equity securities, publically traded investment funds, mortgage backed securities, securities issued by REIT&#8217;s and other companies which invest primarily in real estate.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s securities investments are made under the supervision of a Securities Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;). The Committee currently has three members and is chaired by the Company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board and President, John V. Winfield. The Committee has delegated authority to manage the portfolio to the Company&#8217;s Chairman and President together with such assistants and management committees he may engage. The Committee generally follows certain established investment guidelines for the Company&#8217;s investments. These guidelines presently include: (i) corporate equity securities should be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca or the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ); (ii) the issuer of the listed securities should be in compliance with the listing standards of the applicable national securities exchange; and (iii) investment in a particular issuer should not exceed 10% of the market value of the total portfolio. The investment guidelines do not require the Company to divest itself of investments, which initially meet these guidelines but subsequently fail to meet one or more of the investment criteria. The Committee has in the past approved non-conforming investments and may in the future approve non-conforming investments. The Committee may modify these guidelines from time to time.

&#160;

The Company may also invest, with the approval of the Securities Investment Committee, in unlisted securities, such as convertible notes, through private placements including private equity investment funds. Those investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet as part of other investments and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had other investments of $1,029,000.

&#160;

As part of its investment strategies, the Company may assume short positions in marketable securities. Short sales are used by the Company to potentially offset normal market risks undertaken in the course of its investing activities or to provide additional return opportunities. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had obligations for securities sold (equities short) of $163,000.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The margin used by the Company may fluctuate depending on market conditions. The use of leverage could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to large fluctuations.

&#160;

As Chairman of the Securities Investment Committee, the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), John V. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Portsmouth and Santa Fe and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, Portsmouth and Santa Fe may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the resources of the Portsmouth and Santa Fe, at risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.

&#160; 

Further information with respect to investment in marketable securities and other investments of the Company is set forth in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Hotel&#8217;s operations historically have been seasonal. Like most hotels in the San Francisco area, the Hotel generally maintains higher occupancy and room rates during the first and second quarters of its fiscal year (July 1 through December 31) than it does in the third and fourth quarters (January 1 through June 30). These seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the Hotel.

&#160; 

Competition &#8211; Hotel 

&#160;

The hotel industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located. The San Francisco market is a very competitive market with a high supply of guest rooms and meeting space in the area. In the earlier part of fiscal 2015, the Hotel expanded its meeting space to approximately 22,000 square feet by converting the spa on the lobby level to three additional meeting rooms. This has given the Hotel additional flexibility to host bigger groups with break out needs. The renovation and increase in meeting space has elevated the perception of clients in the market even though total space available is less than the total space of many other hotels in the area. In fiscal 2016, the Hotel replaced the carpet flooring in the lobby and the fourth floor with oak wood, creating an open and welcoming environment. The Hotel also modernized the furniture in the lobby, the porte cochere, and the second floor, and replaced the third floor carpets and doors. The Wellness Center on the fifth floor features a new spa with two treatment rooms and a room for manicures and pedicures. The fitness center has been expanded with state of the art equipment. 

&#160;

The Hotel&#8217;s highest priority is guest satisfaction. Enhancing the guest experience differentiates the Hotel from its competition and is critical to the Hotel&#8217;s objective of building sustainable guest loyalty. In addition to the recent completion of &#8220;The Cloud&#8221; (a technology lounge), three new premium executive meeting rooms and the Karaoke lounge, the Hotel has enhanced the arrival experience of the guests by renovating and upgrading the entrance and the lobby.

&#160;

In order to further enhance the client experience, beginning in fiscal 2016, the Hotel began a limited remodeling of guest rooms. The project included installing new modern showers, granite countertops and other amenities. The Hotel is also committed to promoting innovative business ideas and good corporate citizenship. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With the high demand in guest rooms and the ADR (average daily rate) increasing, the Hotel is less dependent upon group clients and the Hotel can focus more attention on length and patterns of stay that benefit the Hotel. The Hotel is also focusing on high end clients with more banquets and meeting room requirements. Moving forward, the Hotel will continue to focus on cultivating international business, especially from China, and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business, leisure and group travel. The Hotel will also continue in our efforts to upgrade guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the Hotel from its competition, as well as focusing on returning food and beverage operations to profitability. During the last twelve months, the Hotel has seen steady improvement in business and leisure travel. If that trend in the San Francisco market and the hotel industry continues, it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability. However, like all hotels, the Hotel will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment and other risk factors beyond our control, such as the effect of natural disasters and economic uncertainties.

&#160;

The Hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry, which could adversely impact performance. These risks include:

&#160;

&#183; Competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors; &#160;

&#183; increases in operating costs, including wages, benefits, insurance, property taxes and energy, due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates; &#160;

&#183; labor strikes, disruptions or lock outs; &#160;

&#183; dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers, which may fluctuate and is seasonal; &#160;

&#183; increases in energy costs, cost of fuel, airline fares and other expenses related to travel, which may negatively affect traveling; &#160;

&#183; terrorism, terrorism alerts and warnings, wars and other military actions, pandemics or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel; &#160;

&#183; natural disasters; and &#160;

&#183; adverse effects of downturns and recessionary conditions in international, national and/or local economies and market conditions. &#160;

Competition &#8211; Rental Properties 

&#160;

The ownership, operation and leasing of multifamily rental properties are highly competitive. The Company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors. In addition, The Company competes for tenants in markets primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. The Company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to lease its multifamily properties, as well as the rents it is able to charge. In addition, other forms of residential properties, including single family housing and town homes, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for-sale condominium units. The Company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings and the desirability of the Company&#8217;s locations. Resident leases at the Company&#8217;s apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions, supply and demand characteristics, and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities.

&#160;

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

In connection with the ownership of the Hotel, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.

&#160;

Environmental consultants retained by the Partnership or its lenders conducted updated Phase I environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 on the Hotel property. These Phase I assessments relied, in part, on Phase I environmental assessments prepared in connection with the Partnership&#8217;s first mortgage loan obtained in December 2013. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly-available databases; however, Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties.

&#160;

Although the Phase I assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability, we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

&#160;

The Company believes that the Hotel is in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a total of 9 full-time employees in its corporate office. Effective August 2014, the Company entered into a client service agreement with ADP, a professional employer organization serving as an off-site, full service human resource department for its corporate office. ADP personnel management services are delivered by entering into a co-employment relationship with the Company&#8217;s employees. The employees and the Company are not party to any collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

&#160;

Employees of Justice and management of the Hotel are not unionized and the Company believes that their relationships with the Hotel are satisfactory and consistent with the market in San Francisco.

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership, through Operating, had approximately 276 employees. Approximately 78% of those employees were represented by one of three labor unions, and their terms of employment were determined under a collective bargaining agreement (&#8220;CBA&#8221;) to which the Partnership was a party. During the year ended June 30, 2014, the Partnership renewed the CBAs for the Local 2 (Hotel and Restaurant Employees), Local 856 (International Brotherhood of Teamsters), and Local 39 (stationary engineers). The present CBAs expire in July 2018.

&#160;

Negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, which includes not just terms and conditions of employment, but scope and coverage of employees, is a regular and expected course of business operations for the Partnership. The Partnership expects and anticipates that the terms of conditions of CBAs will have an impact on wage and benefit costs, operating expenses, and certain hotel operations during the life of the each CBA, and incorporates these principles into its operating and budgetary practices.
