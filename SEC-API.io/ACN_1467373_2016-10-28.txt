 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Accenture is one of the world&#8217;s leading professional services companies with approximately 384,000 people serving clients in a broad range of industries and in three geographic regions: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey). Our five operating groups, organized by industry, bring together expertise from across the organization to deliver services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology including application services, and operations to our clients. Digital-, cloud- and security-related services are increasingly important components of the services we provide. For fiscal 2016, our revenues before reimbursements (&#8220;net revenues&#8221;) were $32.9 billion. 

We operate globally with one common brand and business model, allowing us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry and functional expertise, technology capabilities and alliances, and our global delivery resources, we seek to provide differentiated services that help our clients measurably improve their business performance and create sustainable value for their customers and stakeholders. Our global delivery model enables us to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on our global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to our clients. 

In fiscal 2016, we continued to implement a strategy focused on industry and technology differentiation, leveraging our global organization to serve clients in locally relevant ways. We continued to make significant investments&#8212;in strategic acquisitions, in assets and offerings, in branding and thought leadership, and in attracting and developing talent&#8212;to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness. 

Operating Groups 

Our five operating groups are Accenture&#8217;s reporting segments and primary market channel, organized around 13 industry groups that serve clients globally in more than 40 industries. Our industry focus gives us an understanding of industry evolution, business issues and applicable technologies, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions tailored to each client or, as appropriate, more standardized capabilities to multiple clients. The operating groups assemble integrated client engagement teams, which typically consist of industry experts, capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge. The operating groups have primary responsibility for building and sustaining long-term client relationships; providing management and technology consulting services; working with the other parts of our business to sell and deliver the full range of our services and capabilities; ensuring client satisfaction; and achieving revenue and profitability objectives. 

The following table shows the current organization of our five operating groups and their 13 industry groups. We do not allocate total assets by operating group, although our operating groups do manage and control certain assets. For certain historical financial information regarding our operating groups (including certain asset information), as well as financial information by geography (including long-lived asset information), see Note 16 (Segment Reporting) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;

Accenture Technology comprises two primary areas: technology services and technology innovation &#38; ecosystem. 

&#8226; 

Technology Services. &#32;Technology Services includes our application services spanning systems integration and application outsourcing and covering the full application lifecycle, from custom systems to all emerging technologies, across every leading technology platform (both traditional and cloud/software-as-a-service-based). It also includes our global delivery capability in Technology and portfolio of products and platforms. We continuously innovate new services and capabilities through early adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence to enhance productivity and create new growth opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Technology Innovation &#38; Ecosystem. &#32;We harness innovation through the research and development activities in the Accenture Labs and through emerging technologies. We also manage our technology platforms and our alliance relationships across a broad range of technology providers, including SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, 

salesforce.com, Workday, Pegasystems and many others, to enhance the value that we and our clients realize from the technology ecosystem. 

Accenture Operations &#32; 

Accenture Operations provides business process services, infrastructure services, security services and cloud services, including the Accenture Cloud Platform. We operate infrastructure and business processes on behalf of clients, increasingly on an as-a-service basis, to help improve their productivity and performance. 

&#8226; 

Business Process Services. &#32;We offer services for specific business functions, such as finance and accounting, procurement, marketing, human resources and learning, as well as industry-specific services, such as credit and health services. We provide these services on a global basis and across industry sectors through our Global Delivery Network.

Infrastructure and Cloud Services. &#32;We provide infrastructure and security design, implementation and operation services to help organizations take advantage of innovative technologies and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their existing technology. Our solutions help clients optimize their IT infrastructures&#8212;whether on-premise, in the cloud or a hybrid of the two. 

Global Delivery Model 

A key differentiator is our global delivery model, which allows us to draw on the benefits of using people and other resources from around the world&#8212;including scalable, standardized processes, methods and tools; automation and artificial intelligence; industry expertise and specialized capabilities; cost advantages; foreign language fluency; proximity to clients; and time zone advantages&#8212;to deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model supports all parts of our business to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions. 

Our Global Delivery Network continues to be a competitive differentiator for us. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately 285,000 &#32;professionals in our network globally in more than 50 delivery centers around the world, as well as Accenture offices and client locations. 

Alliances 

We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners&#8217; products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Most of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services we provide to implement our alliance partners&#8217; products as well as revenue from the resale of their products. We also receive as reimbursement some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners to cover costs we incur for marketing and other assistance. 

Research and Innovation 

We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation, which is a component of our overall investment in our business, have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and development&#8212;on which we spent $643 million, $626 million and $640 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively&#8212;to help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions. We spend a significant portion of our research and development investment to develop market-ready solutions for our clients. 

Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value. Our innovation capabilities include research and thought leadership to identify market and technology trends. We also partner with and invest in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. Our Accenture Labs incubate and prototype new concepts through applied research and development projects. In addition, our studios, innovation centers and delivery centers build, scale and industrialize the delivery of our innovations. 

Employees 

As a talent-led organization, one of our key goals is to have the best talent, with highly specialized skills in each part of our business, at the right levels in the right locations, to enhance our differentiation and competitiveness. We are deeply committed to the career development of our employees, who receive significant and focused technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training appropriate for their roles and levels within the Company. We provide our people with expert content and opportunities to collaborate in a broad range of 

physical and virtual learning environments. We seek to reinforce our employees&#8217; commitments to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management and compensation system and a career philosophy that provides rewards based on individual and Company performance.

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer. Our competitors include: 

&#8226; 

large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do;

&#8226; 

in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. 

Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:

Organizational Structure 

Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than ordinary and deferred shares in its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture Holdings plc, and Accenture plc&#8217;s only business is to hold these shares. As a result, Accenture plc controls Accenture Holdings plc&#8217;s management and operations and consolidates Accenture Holdings plc&#8217;s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture Holdings plc generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees. 

History 

Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Class I common shares of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture Ltd (&#8220;Accenture SCA&#8221;), or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. 

On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland. This transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009. 

On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture&#8217;s presence in Ireland. On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity. This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc). The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. &#8220;Accenture Leadership&#8221; is comprised of members of our global management committee (the Company&#8217;s primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 4% as of August 31, 2016. 

Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares 

Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under &#8220;&#8212;History,&#8221; Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. 

Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number 

of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc. 

A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. 

Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary and Deferred Shares 

Only Accenture plc, Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture International S.&#224;.r.l. &#32; and certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares. Each ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments. As of October 14, 2016, Accenture plc holds a voting interest of approximately 96% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 4% of the voting interest held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 

Only Accenture plc beneficially holds Accenture Holdings plc deferred shares. The deferred shares were issued solely to ensure that Accenture Holdings plc satisfies Irish law minimum share capital requirements for public limited companies at all times and carry no voting rights or income rights and have only limited rights on a return of capital equal to the nominal value of those shares. 

Holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc have the ability, subject to the restrictions on redemption contained in Accen ture Holdings plc&#8217;s articles of association and the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland (the &#8220;Companies Act&#8221;) and any contractual restrictions on redemption that may be applicable to a holder, to require that Accenture Holdings plc redeem all or a portion of such holder&#8217;s ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc. In that case, Accenture Holdings plc is obligated, subject to the availability of distributable reserves, to redeem any such ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc. The redemption price per share generally equals the average of the high and low sale prices of a Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day on which Accenture Holdings plc receives an irrevocable notice of redemption from a holder of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc if received prior to close of trading for that day, or on the following trading day if Accenture Holdings plc receives the irrevocable notice of redemption later than the close of trading on that day. Accenture Holdings plc may, at its option, pay the redemption price in cash or by instructing Accenture plc to deliver Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for dividends and share splits. In order to maintain Accenture plc&#8217;s economic interest in Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued. 

Except in the case of a redemption of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or a transfer of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture Holdings plc&#8217;s articles of association provide that Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares may be transferred only with the consent of the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc. In addition, all holders of ordinary shares (except Accenture plc) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture Holdings plc or transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture Holdings plc determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation, or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture Holdings plc or its affiliates for Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder&#8217;s Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares in the tender offer). 

Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares 

Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc.
