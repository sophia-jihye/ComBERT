 Item 1. Business 

Mitcham Industries, Inc. (&#147;MII&#148;), a Texas corporation, was incorporated in 1987. We provide equipment to the geophysical, oceanographic and hydrographic industries. Headquartered in Huntsville, Texas, we have a global presence with operating locations in Salem, New Hampshire; Calgary, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; Singapore; Ufa, Bashkortostan, Russia; Budapest, Hungary; Lima, Peru; Bogota, Colombia and the United Kingdom. Through our Equipment Leasing Segment, we believe we are the largest independent provider of exploration equipment to the seismic industry. Our worldwide Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment includes its Seamap business, which designs, manufactures and sells specialized seismic marine equipment and Klein Marine Systems, Inc. (&#147;Klein&#148;), which designs, manufactures and sells high performance side scan sonar systems. We operate in two business segments, Equipment Leasing and Equipment Manufacturing and Sales. 

Our Equipment Leasing segment is primarily engaged in the leasing of seismic equipment to companies in the oil and gas industry throughout the world. We conduct our leasing business through MII, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our branches in Colombia and Peru. We also sell new and used seismic equipment from time to time. The subsidiaries that conduct our leasing business are Mitcham Canada ULC (&#147;MCL&#148;), Seismic Asia Pacific Pty Ltd. (&#147;SAP&#148;), Mitcham Seismic Eurasia LLC (&#147;MSE&#148;), Mitcham Europe Ltd. (&#147;MEL&#148;) and Mitcham Marine Leasing Pte. Ltd. (&#147;MML&#148;). 

Our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment is engaged in the design, production and sale of marine seismic equipment and oceanographic and hydrographic equipment. The operations of this segment are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Seamap (UK) Ltd. (&#147;Seamap UK&#148;) , Seamap Pte. Ltd. (&#147;Seamap Singapore&#148;, and, together with Seamap UK, &#147;Seamap&#148;), Klein and SAP. 

We acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the operations of Klein did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2016. Klein has over forty-eight years of experience with the development and manufacture of high performance side scan sonar systems. Our side scan sonar systems are deployed by navies, port authorities, other governmental organizations, marine survey companies and universities worldwide. Klein operates from a single facility in Salem, New Hampshire. 

For additional information about our business segments, including related financial information, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 7 &#150; &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; of this Form 10-K. 

Our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world, which are described under &#147;&#150; Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing.&#148; 

Equipment Leasing Segment &#150; 

We own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers. Our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition, including various electronic components of land, transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems, geophones and cables, peripheral equipment, survey and other equipment. The majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by the Sercel subsidiaries of Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (&#147;Sercel&#148;) and Geospace Technologies Corporation (&#147;Geospace&#148;). However, we also purchase equipment from a number of other equipment manufacturers. At January 31, 2016, approximately 55% of our equipment lease pool, on a cost basis, consisted of seismic recording channels, with the remainder consisting of geophones, energy source controllers and other peripheral equipment. 

&#160;

We lease our equipment on a short-term basis, generally for two to six months, to seismic contractors who need equipment for a particular seismic survey. Certain equipment that is used in vertical seismic profiling, or &#147;downhole&#148; operations, is generally leased to oil field service companies and often for shorter periods, ranging from a few days to two weeks. Short-term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies. A typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys. Our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew&#146;s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew. Demand for short-term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors, including: (1) the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys, (2) seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions, (3) the term of the lease and (4) the cost of seismic equipment. We believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short-term seismic equipment leasing as a cost-effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an item&#146;s expected useful life, utilization, acquisition cost and the term of the lease. 

From time to time, we sell used equipment from our lease pool in response to specific demand or to dispose of older equipment. 

Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment &#150; 

Seamap designs, manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic, hydrographic and offshore industries. Seamap&#146;s primary products include the GunLink&#153; seismic source acquisition and control systems, commonly referred to as &#147;energy source controllers &#147; or &#147;air gun controllers&#148;, which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources, and the BuoyLink&#153; RGPS tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers. In May 2014, Seamap acquired two product lines from ION Geophysical Corporation (&#147;ION&#148;), Digishot &#174; energy source controllers and Sleeve Gun energy sources. We believe that Seamap is the primary provider of energy source controllers. 

Klein primarily designs, manufactures and sells advanced side scan sonar systems and waterside security systems for the oceanographic, hydrographic and defense industries on a world-wide basis. Klein&#146;s family of side scan sonar products are used in a variety of applications including hydrographic surveys, naval mine counter measure operations, search and recovery operations, ocean bottom profiling and other underwater object detection operations. 

SAP sells equipment, consumables, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to companies in the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. SAP is a distributor for a number of manufacturers of products, including Klein and occasionally Seamap. 

Seamap and Klein have overlapping customer bases and it is not uncommon for a marine survey vessel to be equipped with products from Seamap and from Klein. We expect that in the future we will have opportunities to package products from Seamap and Klein in response to requests from customers. 

The technologies underlying the products of Seamap and Klein are similar, as are the engineering disciplines and challenges. We anticipate significant engineering collaboration between Seamap and Klein and plan to jointly develop new products. 

The manufacturing processes of Seamap and Klein are similar. While we expect to maintain separate manufacturing operations, we do believe there will be opportunities for collaboration. Such collaboration might include using common suppliers, outsourcing specific functions between the operations and common support and repair activities. 

For information regarding our operating results and total assets by segment, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to supply technologically advanced equipment solutions to our customers in the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense industries. To accomplish this, we have identified the following major objectives: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Provide short-term rental services for technologically advanced equipment in response to customer demand. We determine the type of equipment to add to our lease pool based on the requirements of our customers. We intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool. We believe that the availability of a large and diverse equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors, oil field service providers and other marine operators to lease, rather than purchase, such equipment, due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short-term leases. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop and produce specialized equipment for the marine industry. We seek to identify opportunities to develop new product offerings in response to demand from the marine seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense industries. We think this will allow us to leverage our geographic footprint, engineering and manufacturing operations and customer relationships. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain diverse international operations. We believe our broad geographic footprint is an important asset. We believe that we can conduct business in wide-ranging geographic areas from our existing facilities. However, for legal, tax or operational reasons, we may decide in the future to establish facilities in additional locations. We generally expect to establish any such facilities through a &#147;green field&#148; approach, but we may consider making selective acquisitions from time to time. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain relationships with major seismic equipment manufacturers. Our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers provide us with access to technologically advanced equipment and allow us to expand our equipment lease pool through favorable pricing and delivery terms. We believe these relationships provide a competitive advantage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue additional business development opportunities. We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business activities within the oil service, hydrographic and oceanographic industries. These opportunities could include the introduction of new products or services or the acquisition of existing businesses. Seismic Technology and the Oil Service Industry 

Oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells, in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas. These technologies are also used in mining and civil engineering operations. 

Historically, a 2-D seismic survey was the standard data acquisition technique used to map geologic formations over a broad area. 2-D seismic data can be visualized as a single vertical plane of subsurface information. Data gathered from a 3-D seismic survey is best visualized as a cube of information that can be sliced into numerous planes, providing different views of a geologic structure with much higher resolution than is available with traditional 2-D seismic survey techniques. 3-D seismic surveys generally require a larger amount of equipment than 2-D surveys. By using a greater number of channels and flexible configuration, 3-D seismic data provides more extensive and detailed information regarding the subsurface geology than 2-D data. As a result, 3-D data allows the geophysicists interpreting the data to more closely select the optimal location of a prospective drill site or define an oil and gas reservoir. 

In the exploration and development process, oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives. Because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells, decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process. Seismic data can also be useful in designing and monitoring complex well completion programs, such as hydraulic fracturing. Since 

&#160;

3-D seismic data increases drilling success rates and reduces costs, we believe that 3-D seismic surveys are now predominant. As a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data, which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit data, seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years. Advances in seismic recording equipment have made it more feasible to deploy recording channels in greater density. These advances include cabled recording systems capable of handling greater amounts of data and wireless recording systems. By deploying recording channels in greater density, higher resolution images of the sub-surface can be created. Other industry advances include the use of high resolution three-component sensors (&#147;3C&#148;), which enhance the image of the sub-surface. These and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs. 

Oil and gas companies have begun to utilize time lapse (&#147;4-D&#148;) seismic techniques for producing oil and gas fields. 4-D surveys involve periodically acquiring seismic data over the same area. These techniques allow the oil and gas company to monitor and analyze the production from existing properties and optimize production and reserve recovery. 

With the expanded use of seismic technology, particularly 3-D seismic surveys, the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years. Demand for higher resolution data, larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys now requires seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels. Additionally, the size of seismic surveys varies significantly, requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys. As a result of these changes, the number of seismic survey channels has increased from smaller 2-D surveys, which typically averaged less than 1,000 channels, to larger 3-D surveys, which today are often more than 15,000 channels and sometimes use as many as 100,000 channels. We believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary, thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment. 

In certain applications, specialized seismic recording devices are deployed vertically within a well bore. Multiple recording channels, or &#147;levels,&#148; are generally deployed within a given well and are referred to as &#147;downhole&#148; or &#147;VSP&#148; (vertical seismic profiling) tools. These applications are used to provide additional data points in a traditional seismic survey, to monitor and analyze reservoir properties, and to monitor and analyze fluid treatment operations, as well as a variety of other uses. 

Seismic surveys utilizing 2-D, 3-D or 4-D techniques require essentially the same equipment. The manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs, however. Accordingly, our equipment can generally be utilized in 2-D, 3-D and 4-D seismic surveys. Since 3-D and 4-D seismic surveys generally utilize significantly more equipment than 2-D seismic surveys, the potential to lease our seismic equipment has increased from earlier periods. 

Side Scan Sonar Technology 

A side scan sonar (sound navigation and ranging) system is a specialized system used for detecting objects on the seafloor by transmitting sound energy to the right and left of the host vehicle and processing the return signals (echoes) that have bounced off the seafloor or other bottom objects into two dimensional, photo like, images of the ocean bottom. Basic side scan sonar systems do not provide depth information nor do they penetrate the seafloor bottom. However, side scan sonar models are available that incorporate bathymetry elements (the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors). These systems do provide bathymetric (depth) information that is co-registered with side scan data. Sub-seafloor bottom profiling can also be used in concert with side scan sonar technology to look below the seabed into the stratum layers. 

Users of side scan sonar technology include governmental and military organizations, port and harbor authorities, fire and police departments, offshore oil and gas operators and contractors, universities and scientific organizations, mining companies, marine survey companies and marine salvage operators. Applications that utilize side scan sonar technology include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Preplanned shipping route surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mine counter measures and mine-like object detection &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Environmental assessments &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hydrographic surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Waterside security &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Dredging operations &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pipeline and cable surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Bridge scour monitoring &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Search and recovery &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Underwater construction surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pipeline and cable route surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Marine research &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Archaeology surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Marine life and habitat monitoring &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mining surveys &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Treasure hunting &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Marine salvage operations Business and Operations 

Equipment Leasing Segment &#150; 

Equipment Leasing. We own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short-term leasing to our customers, who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers (in the case of downhole equipment). We lease this equipment multiple times until the earlier of the end of its useful life or its sale. Our equipment leasing services generally include the lease of the various components of seismic data acquisition systems and related equipment to meet a customer&#146;s job specifications. These specifications frequently vary as to the number of required recording channels, geophones, energy sources (e.g., earth vibrators) and other equipment. Our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment. 

Our land equipment lease pool includes a total of approximately 290,000 seismic recording land channels (each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data), including approximately 90,000 channels of wireless recording equipment. Included in this total is approximately 55,000 stations (165,000 channels) of three-component equipment. Other land equipment in our lease pool includes geophones and cables, heli-picker equipment, batteries and other peripheral equipment. Our lease pool of marine seismic equipment includes more than 12 kilometers of streamers (recording channels that are towed behind a vessel), air guns, streamer-positioning equipment, energy source controllers and other equipment. Our lease pool of downhole equipment includes approximately 200 levels of downhole seismic tools. Our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry. Our marine lease pool also includes energy source controllers and RGPS tracking systems that are manufactured by our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment. We estimate that as of January 31, 2016, (&#147;fiscal 2016&#148;), 2015 (&#147;fiscal 2015&#148;) and 2014 (&#147;fiscal 2014&#148;) approximately 6.5%, 14.3%, and 28.1%, respectively, of our lease pool equipment was deployed on an active contract. 

We maintain a master lease agreement with each of our customers that outlines the general terms and conditions of our leases. Individual transactions are generally documented through an &#147;equipment lease 

&#160;

schedule&#148; that incorporates the terms and conditions of the master lease agreement. Individual leases generally have terms of two to six months, or a few days to two weeks in the case of downhole equipment, and are typically renewable following the initial rental period. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an item&#146;s expected useful life, utilization, initial cost and the term of the lease. We provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and provide replacement equipment, as necessary. In addition, we occasionally provide field technical support services when requested by our customers. The customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages, other than normal wear and tear. In the case of lost or destroyed equipment, the customer is required to reimburse us for the replacement cost of the equipment, at a price specified in the lease agreement, or to provide acceptable replacement equipment. The customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes, other than income taxes, related to the lease of the equipment. The customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance. It is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly basis or on a daily rate, depending on the circumstances. 

Seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions. In Canada and Russia, a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months, from December through March or April. During the months in which the weather is warmer, certain areas are not accessible to trucks, earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain. Seismic survey operations can also be effected by other weather patterns such as periods of heavy rain. While these periods of heavy rain can affect our business in certain geographic regions, the primary seasonality of our business relates to the Canadian and Russian winter seasons. We are able, in many cases, to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization. For additional information about the impact of seasonality and weather, see Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Upon completion of a lease, the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities where it is inspected, tested, repaired, if necessary, and staged for another project. While the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs, during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer. Therefore, managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations. Given the short term of most of our leases, we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 65%. However, many factors can affect this utilization rate, including the term of our leases, the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities, the time required to inspect, test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment. 

We maintain facilities for the inspection, testing and repair of land seismic equipment in Huntsville, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; Ufa, Bashkortostan, Russia; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Brisbane, Australia and Singapore. We maintain marine equipment inspection, testing and repair facilities in Huntsville, Texas and Singapore. We believe that this broad network of support facilities helps us effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations. 

Lease Pool Equipment Sales. On occasion, we sell used equipment from our lease pool, normally in response to specific customer demand or to declining demand for rental of specific equipment. Used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item. When used equipment is sold from our lease pool, the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold. Sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect. Sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately $2.2 million, $3.2 million and $6.9 million in each of the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We typically do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment on a regular basis. However, we will evaluate any opportunities for the sale of equipment from our lease pool and, based upon our evaluation, may sell additional equipment. Such sales of lease pool equipment could be material. Under the terms of our lease agreements, customers are responsible for lost or destroyed equipment. Charges for such lost equipment are at prices specified in the particular lease agreement and are reflected as lease pool equipment sales in the accompanying financial statements. 

&#160;

Other Equipment Sales. The &#147; Other equipment sales&#148; included in our Equipment Leasing segment generally fall into two broad categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sales of &#147;heli-pickers&#148; and related equipment. We sell a variety of equipment and supplies utilized in the deployment and retrieval of seismic equipment by helicopter, some of which we produce. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sales of new seismic equipment. On occasion, we will sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from manufacturers in response to a specific demand from a customer. We may provide installation services with some of this equipment. Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment &#150; 

Through our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment, which is conducted by Seamap, SAP and Klein, we develop, manufacture and sell a range of proprietary products for the marine seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense industries. 

Seamap&#146;s primary products include (1) the GunLink seismic source acquisition and control systems, which are designed to provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise monitoring and control of energy sources; (2) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of marine seismic energy sources and streamers; (3) Digishot energy source controller; and (4) Sleeve Gun energy sources. The Digishot and Sleeve Gun product lines were acquired from ION in May 2014. Seamap&#146;s other products include streamer weight collars, depth transducers, pressure transducers, air control valves and source array systems. In addition to selling complete products, Seamap provides spare and replacement parts related to the products it sells. Seamap also provides certain services related to its products. These include repair services, engineering services, training, field service operations and umbilical terminations. 

Marine seismic contractors, geotechnical and hydrographic survey companies are generally Seamap&#146;s customers. These contractors operate vessels used to conduct seismic surveys in deep water marine environments. The customer base for Seamap is generally the same as that for the marine portion of our Equipment Leasing Segment. Seamap&#146;s customers operate in all areas of the world. 

We maintain a Seamap facility in the United Kingdom which includes engineering, training, sales and field service operations. Our Seamap facility in Singapore includes engineering, assembly, sales, repair and field service operations. Components for our products are sourced from a variety of suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. Products are generally assembled, tested and shipped from our facility in Singapore; however, inventory and order fulfillment operations related to the Sleeve Gun product are conducted from our headquarters in Huntsville, Texas. 

SAP sells equipment, consumables, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. SAP is a manufacturer&#146;s representative for an array of equipment lines. 

Klein is a supplier of side scan sonar equipment and waterside security and surveillance systems. Products are marketed to governmental and commercial customers through an internal sales organization and a network of distributors and representatives around the world. Sales, engineering, production and administrative operations are performed from Klein&#146;s facility in Salem, New Hampshire. 

Klein offers an extensive product line of sidescan sonar systems and related products. These products are utilized in a number of applications including portable search and recovery, shallow and deep water surveys, navel mine warfare, underwater object detection and bathymetry. These products can be deployed from vessels of varying size, including autonomous underwater vehicles and autonomous service vehicles. 

&#160;

Klein&#146;s HarborGuard &#174; Integrated Waterside Surveillance and Security System (the &#147;HarborGuard system&#148;) combines radar, video and other surveillance technology to provide security for a variety of waterside installations. The HarborGuard system is currently in use by the U.S. Navy for protection of bases and facilities worldwide. In addition, other commercial and local government agencies are using the system for offshore platform, port, harbor and bridge security and surveillance applications. 

Key Supplier Agreements 

The Sercel Equipment Agreement 

From 1996 through fiscal 2014, we had a series of supply agreements with Sercel covering a variety of products. These agreements generally provided that we agreed to purchase a minimum amount of certain products within a prescribed time period. In return, Sercel agreed to refer any inquiries for short term rentals of those products to us and not to refer any competitor of ours as a source of such rentals. While we believe we benefited from our agreements with Sercel, we also believe that, given current market conditions, it is not in our best interests to commit to minimum purchases of any particular type of equipment. Accordingly, in January 2014 we allowed the then existing agreements to expire. We believe that our relationship with Sercel, as well as with other manufacturers, remains good and do not expect the termination and non-renewal of the agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Other Agreements 

SAP has a number of manufacturer&#146;s representation agreements for certain product lines, including: acoustic positioning systems, GPS systems, heave compensators and attitude sensors, hydrographic data acquisition systems, magnetometers, tide gauges and current meters, radio positioning equipment, side-scan sonar and sub-bottom profiling systems, underwater communications and location devices, echo sounders and transducers. 

Klein has a number of agreements for the distribution or representation of its products. These agreements are generally cancellable upon a notice period of from one to three months. 

Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing 

Our lease customers generally are seismic data acquisition contractors. We typically have a small number of lease customers, the composition of which changes yearly as leases are negotiated and concluded and equipment needs vary. As of January 31, 2016, we had approximately 26 lease customers with 22 active leases of various lengths, but all for less than a year. 

We do not maintain a backlog of orders relating to our Equipment Leasing segment. As of January 31, 2016, our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately $8.7 million, compared to $7.7 million as of January 31, 2015. We expect all of these orders to be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending January 31, 2017. 

We participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the industry of our products and services and we advertise in major trade journals.

During fiscal 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenues. During fiscal 2015 no one single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. One customer accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during these periods. See Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Competition 

Equipment Leasing &#150; 

Our major competitors include the seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms, offer leases with purchase options and offer short term rentals of their products. In addition, some seismic contractors might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time. We face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing, but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic 

&#160;

presence as we do. We compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of (1) price, (2) delivery terms, (3) availability of desired equipment and (4) location of equipment. We believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies. 

We compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners, including seismic data acquisition contractors, who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. 

Equipment Manufacturing and Sales &#150; 

We compete with a number of other manufacturers of marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. We generally compete for sales of equipment on the basis of (1) technical capability, (2) reliability, (3) price, (4) delivery terms and (5) service. 

Suppliers 

We have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool. We acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from Sercel and Geospace. However, we also acquire lease pool equipment from a number of other suppliers. Management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory and that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative agreements in the event of interruption of supply. For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 24%, 31%, and 33%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from Sercel. For additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers, see Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, we employed approximately 210 people full-time, none of whom were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 

Intellectual Property 

The products designed, manufactured and sold by Seamap utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed or have licensed from others. Our internally developed intellectual property consists of product designs and trade secrets. In connection with the acquisition of the Digishot and Sleeve Gun product lines from ION in May 2014, we acquired certain United States and foreign patents related to energy source controllers and other technology. We believe these acquired intellectual property rights will allow us to incorporate certain design features and functionality in future versions of our GunLink product line. We believe the pertinent patents to have a valid term through at least 2023. 

In connection with the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, we acquired certain intellectual property consisting primarily of product designs and trade secrets. 

We own intellectual property relating to the design and manufacture of heli-pickers. This intellectual property includes United States, Canadian, Australian and United Kingdom patents. 

For additional information regarding the risks associated with our intellectual property, see Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Environmental Regulation 

We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to worker safety and health, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, 

&#160;

chemicals and other materials used in our manufacturing processes or otherwise generated from our operations. We have established and implemented environmental procedures for the management of these chemicals and materials as well as the handling and recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for air emissions and water discharges resulting from our manufacturing processes, impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection, result in capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges, and obligate us to use more stringent precautions for disposal of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief. We may be subject to strict joint and several liability as well as natural resource damages resulting from spills or releases of chemicals, or other regulated materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by spills or releases that may affect them. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, remediate environmental contamination, and undertake measures to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be significant. 

In addition, certain regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdiction address the manner in which certain hazardous materials, such as electric storage batteries can be transported. These regulations may limit our ability, and that of our customers, to transport equipment necessary for seismic operations, particularly by air. These limitations may significantly increase the time and cost required to transport such equipment. 

The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. For instance, the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to climate-change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon-based fuels or decreasing the performance of oil or natural gas exploration or production activities by energy companies, could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the implementation of new or more restrictive regulatory initiatives in response to significant spills by oil and natural gas operators, such as occurred following the Deepwater Horizon incident that occurred in April 2010, may delay or decrease the pace of exploration or production activities, which may result in a similar decrease in demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We are also subject to federal, state and foreign worker safety and health laws and regulations. These laws and regulations obligate us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees, state and legal governmental authorities and citizens. We do not believe that compliance with existing applicable environmental, worker safety and health laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business; however, we cannot give any assurance that this will continue in the future. For additional information regarding the risk associated with environmental matters, see Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors.&#148;
