 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Halyard Health, Inc. is a global company which seeks to advance health and healthcare by preventing infection, eliminating pain and speeding recovery. We have two business segments: Surgical and Infection Prevention (&#8220;S&#38;IP&#8221;) and Medical Devices. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#8220;Halyard,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Halyard Health, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to &#8220;Kimberly-Clark&#8221; mean Kimberly-Clark Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. 

Our products and solutions are designed to address some of today&#8217;s most important healthcare needs; namely, preventing infection and reducing the use of narcotics while helping patients move from surgery to recovery. We sell our products in more than 100 &#32;countries. We market and support the efficacy, safety and economic benefit of our products with a significant body of clinical evidence. 

On October 31, 2014 , Kimberly-Clark distributed all of our capital stock to its shareholders and completed the previously announced spin-off of its healthcare division (the &#8220;Spin-off&#8221;). Halyard was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February, 2014 &#32;in anticipation of that Spin-off and Kimberly-Clark transferred its Health Care business to us prior to the Spin-off. 

The address of our principal executive offices is 5405 Windward Parkway, Suite 100 South, Alpharetta, Georgia 30004, and our telephone number is (678) 425-9273. 

Business Segments 

We are organized into two operating segments based on product groupings: S&#38;IP and Medical Devices. These operating segments, which are also our reportable global business segments, were determined in accordance with how our executive managers develop and execute global strategies to drive growth and profitability. These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses. Segment management is evaluated on several factors, including operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs and expenses not associated with the business units including charges related to pre-Spin-off transaction, post-Spin-off transition, certain litigation matters, manufacturing footprint changes in Thailand and goodwill impairment. 

The principal sources of revenue in each global business segment are described below: 

&#8226; 

S&#38;IP provides healthcare supplies and solutions that target the prevention of healthcare-associated infections. This segment has recognized brands across its portfolio of product offerings, including sterilization wrap, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection, protective apparel and medical exam gloves. This business is also a global leader in education to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Products in this segment are sold under the HALYARD or KIMGUARD ONE-STEP, QUICK CHECK, SMART-FOLD, POWERGUARD, MICROCOOL, FLUIDSHIELD, PURPLE NITRILE, LAVENDER, STERLING and other brand names. 

&#8226; 

Medical Devices provides a portfolio of innovative product offerings focused on pain management and respiratory and digestive health to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. These products include post-operative pain management solutions, minimally invasive interventional (or chronic) pain therapies, closed airway suction systems and enteral feeding tubes. Products in this segment are sold under the ON-Q, COOLIEF, MICROCUFF, MIC-KEY, QUIKBLOC, HOMEPUMP and other brand names. 

For additional information concerning our business segments, please refer to Note 14 &#32;to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 

Sales and Marketing 

We direct our primary sales and marketing efforts toward hospitals and other healthcare providers to highlight the unique benefits and competitive differentiation of our branded products. We work directly with physicians, nurses, professional societies, hospital administrators and healthcare group purchasing organizations (&#8220;GPOs&#8221;) to collaborate and educate on emerging practices and clinical techniques that prevent infection, eliminate pain and speed recovery. These marketing programs are delivered directly to healthcare providers. Additionally, we provide marketing programs to our strategic distribution partners throughout the world. 

&#160; 

&#32;1 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Distribution 

While our products are generally marketed directly to hospitals and other healthcare providers, they are often sold through third-party distribution channels. 

Our products are sold principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to healthcare facilities and other end customers. In 2015 , approximately 65% &#32;of our net sales in North America were made through distributors. Globally, sales to one distributor accounted for approximately 18% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net sales. No other customer or distributor accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our net sales in 2015 . This distributor purchases both S&#38;IP and Medical Device products from us under standard terms and conditions of sale. In certain cases, this distributor also competes with us. See &#8220;Competition.&#8221; 

Approximately 45% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;global net sales, including sales to wholesale distributors, were contracted through five &#32;major national GPOs, principally relating to our S&#38;IP business. Of these 2015 &#32;GPO-contracted sales, 57% &#32;were represented by contracts that will expire by the end of 2016 &#32;and 43% &#32;were represented by contracts that will expire between 2017 &#32;and 2018 . 

Outside North America, sales are made either directly to end customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. In 2015 , approximately 63% &#32;of our net sales outside North America were made through wholesalers or distributors. 

We operate six &#32;major distribution centers located in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan that ship multiple finished products to multiple customers, as well as ten &#32;other distribution sites that also have customer shipping capabilities, in order to optimize cost and customer service requirements. 

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. 

Raw Materials 

We use a wide variety of raw materials and other inputs in our production processes, with polypropylene polymers and nitrile constituting our most significant raw material purchases. We base our purchasing decisions on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. 

Global commodity prices can affect pricing of certain raw materials on which we rely. In our S&#38;IP business, polypropylene polymers, which are oil based, and nitrile represent a significant component of our manufacturing costs. In addition, the prices of other raw materials we use, such as resins and finishing supplies, often fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices. Prices of these commodities can be volatile and have varied significantly in recent years, contributing to fluctuations in our results of operations. 

Competition 

The markets for our products are highly competitive. No one company competes with us across the breadth of our offerings, but we face significant competition in U.S. and international markets. 

Surgical and Infection Prevention 

There are a significant number of manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies, and the market for S&#38;IP products is extremely competitive. In developed markets, the major competitors of our S&#38;IP business include Cardinal Health, Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Hogy Medical, Multigate Medical Products, M&#246;lnlycke Health Care and HARTMANN Group. In the United States several of our distribution partners and GPOs are also competitors or are increasingly seeking to compete with us by direct sourcing their own products. In developing and emerging markets, we compete against multiple use products, or non-use of infection prevention products, due in large part to lower infection prevention awareness and education. 

The highly competitive environment of the S&#38;IP business requires us to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. Our products face competition from other brands that may be less expensive than our products and from other companies that may have more resources than we do. Competitive factors include price, alternative clinical practices, innovation, quality and reputation. To successfully compete, we must often demonstrate that our products offer higher quality, more innovative features or better value versus other products. 

&#160; 

&#32;2 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medical Devices 

There are a variety of treatment means and alternative clinical practices to address the management of surgical and chronic pain and respiratory and digestive health. We face competition from these alternative treatments, as well as improvements and innovations in products and technologies by our competitors. 

Competitors for our medical device products are fragmented by particular product category, and the individual markets for these products are highly competitive. Major competitors of our Medical Devices business include, among others: 

&#8226; 

Pain Management: B. Braun Medical Inc., St. Jude Medical, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Teleflex Incorporated, Ambu A/S and Baxter International, Inc. 

&#8226; 

Respiratory: Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sage Products LLC and Smiths Medical 

&#8226; 

Digestive Health: Boston Scientific Corporation, Cook Medical, and Applied Medical Technology, Inc. 

In developing and emerging markets, alternative clinical practices and different standards of care are our primary competition. 

While we believe that the number of procedures using our medical devices will grow due, in part, to increasing global access to healthcare, we expect that our ability to compete with other providers of similar devices will be impacted by rapid technological advances, pricing pressures and third-party reimbursement practices. We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies such as our efficient manufacturing processes, established distribution network, field sales organization and customer service, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors. 

Research and Development 

We continuously engage in research and development to commercialize new products and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of our existing products. We incurred $32 million &#32;in 2015 , $34 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $38 million &#32;in 2013 &#32;on research and development to develop new products and processes, and to improve existing products and processes. These expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, product trial costs, outside laboratory and license fees, the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities and asset write-offs for equipment that does not reach success in product manufacturing certifications. We intend to increase our research and development efforts as a key strategy for growth. 

In our S&#38;IP business, we are focused on maintaining our market position by providing innovative customer-preferred product enhancements, with a particular focus on the operating room. Leveraging customer insights and our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities, we seek to continuously improve our product designs, specifications and features to deliver cost efficiencies while improving healthcare worker and patient protection. We continuously refresh our surgical drape and gown portfolio to ensure that our products are aligned with the latest procedural and market trends. Our research team works with healthcare providers to develop and design exam glove and apparel portfolios that optimize comfort and fit and provide cost-effective infection prevention solutions for use throughout the hospital. 

In our Medical Devices business, we collaborate with physicians to develop solutions that seek to accelerate the global adoption of our therapies and procedures. We are investing to expand the indications for use of our pain products with clinical research and studies and associated new product developments. We are expanding our portfolio with customer-preferred product enhancements, such as next generation cooled radiofrequency generators and a full line of needles, kits and accessories for continuous peripheral nerve block procedures. 

We are also investing in new categories and solutions that complement our technical expertise and existing intellectual property. We are particularly focused on those new categories that we believe will leverage our existing scalable technology platforms as well as our sales and marketing expertise. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. 

&#160; 

&#32;3 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to the technology used in many of our products. For example, we utilize patents in our sterilization wrap, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection, protective apparel and medical exam gloves in our S&#38;IP segment. These patents generally expire between 2016 &#32;and 2032 . None of the patents we license from third parties are material to our S&#38;IP segment. In our Medical Devices segment, we utilize patents in our surgical pain management, chronic pain management, respiratory health and digestive health products. These patents generally expire between 2019 &#32;and 2032 . None of the patents we license from third parties are material to our Medical Devices segment. 

We are undertaking efforts to ensure our customers&#8217; transition from the Kimberly-Clark brand to our Halyard-branded products. In conjunction with the Spin-off, we have entered into a royalty agreement under which we have access to use the Kimberly-Clark brand for up to 24 months following the Spin-off date as we manage the packaging changes with global regulatory bodies. Royalties are required to be paid for products sold bearing the Kimberly-Clark brand only. 

We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products, as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark. 

Regulatory Matters 

The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. Our operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. 

Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. For example, in the United States, before we can market a new medical product, or market a new use for, claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;510(k) clearance&#8221;) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). In order for us to obtain 510(k) clearance, the FDA must determine that our proposed product is substantially equivalent to a device legally on the market, known as a predicate device, with respect to intended use, technology, safety and effectiveness. Similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. For instance, the European Commission, or EC, has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these regulations, manufacturing plants must have received certification of conformity from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a &#8220;CE&#8221; mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark may not be sold or distributed in the European Union. 

We expect compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product&#8217;s production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. 

In addition to regulatory initiatives, our business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 

&#160; 

&#32;4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Access to healthcare products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by healthcare payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of healthcare products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of healthcare products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on our products for the foreseeable future. 

We expect debate to continue during the next several years at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery, and payment for healthcare products and services. We believe that future legislation and regulation in the markets we serve could affect access to healthcare products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, change healthcare delivery systems, create new fees and obligations, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which we or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 

Since we market our products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action. 

Demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients&#8217; medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels. From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business, and the federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing reimbursement levels for medical expenses paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay. 

Employee and Labor Relations 

In our worldwide operations, we had approximately 12,000 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015 . We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. Our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. We are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters. 

While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
