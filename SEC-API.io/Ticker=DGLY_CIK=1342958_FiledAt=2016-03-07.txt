Overview 

&#160; 

Digital Ally produces digital video imaging and storage products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. Our current products are an in-car digital video/audio recorder contained in a rear-view mirror for use in law enforcement and commercial fleets, a system that provides our law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from multiple vantage points and hands-free automatic activation of body-worn cameras and in-car video systems; a weather-resistant mobile digital video recording system for use on motorcycles, ATV&#8217;s and boats, a miniature digital video system designed to be worn on an individual&#8217;s body; and a hand-held laser speed detection device that it is offering primarily to law enforcement agencies. We have active research and development programs to adapt its technologies to other applications. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to address needs in a variety of other industries and markets, including mass transit, school bus, taxi cab and the military. We sell our products to law enforcement agencies and other security organizations, consumer and commercial fleet operators through direct sales domestically and third-party distributors internationally. We have several new and derivative products in research and development that we anticipate will begin commercial production during 2016. 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the &#8220;Acquired Company&#8221;), we had not conducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc. 

&#160; 

The Acquired Company, which was incorporated on May 16, 2003, engaged in the design, development, marketing and sale of bow hunting-related products. Its principal product was a digital video recording system for use in the bow hunting industry. It changed its business plan in 2004 to adapt its digital video recording system for use in the law enforcement and security markets. We began shipments of our in-car digital video rear view mirror in March 2006. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;DGLY.&#8221; We conduct our business from 9705 Loiret Boulevard, Lenexa, Kansas 66219. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

We produce and sell digital audio/video recording, storage and other products in law enforcement and commercial applications. These product series were used primarily in law enforcement applications, all of which use the core competency of our technology in digital video compression, recording and storage. During 2011, we completed the launch of several derivative products as &#8220;event recorders&#8221; that can be used in taxi cab, limousine, ambulance and other commercial fleet vehicle applications. We have launched additional derivative products during 2012 through 2015. We also intend to produce and sell other digital video products in the future. These products incorporate our standards-based digital compression capability that allows the recording of significant time periods on a chip and circuit board which can be designed into small forms and stored. The following describes our product portfolio. 

&#160; 

In-Car Digital Video Mirror System &#8211; DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-750 and DVM-800 

&#160; 

In-car video systems for patrol cars are now a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based systems with cameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat of the vehicle. Most manufacturers have already developed and transitioned completely to digital video, but some have not transitioned totally to a fully solid-state digital system and continue to rely on hard-drive or DVD based systems which are less reliable and susceptible to heat, cold and vibration. 

&#160; 

Our digital video rear view mirror unit is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that is integrated into a rear-view mirror, with a monitor, GPS and 900 MHz audio transceiver. Our system is more compact and unobtrusive than certain of our competitors because it requires no recording equipment to be located in other parts of the vehicle. 

&#160; 

Our in-car digital video rear view mirror has the following features: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; wide angle zoom color camera; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; standards-based video and audio compression and recording; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; system is concealed in the rear view mirror, replacing factory rear view mirror; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; monitor in rear-view mirror is invisible when not activated; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; eliminates need for analog tapes to store and catalogue; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; easily installs in any vehicle; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ability to integrate with body-worn cameras including auto-activation of either system; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; archives to computers (wirelessly) and to DVDs, CD-ROMs, or file servers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 900 MHz audio transceiver with automatic activation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; marks exact location of incident with integrated GPS; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; playback using Windows Media Player; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; optional wireless download of stored video evidence; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; proprietary software protects the chain of custody; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; records to rugged and durable solid state memory. &#160; 

In-Car Digital Video &#8220;Event Recorder&#8221; System &#8211;DVM-250 Plus 

&#160; 

We believe there are several other markets and industries that may find our in-car digital video rear view mirror unit useful, such as the ambulance, school bus, mass transit and delivery service industries. We market a product designed to address these commercial fleet markets with our DVM-250 Plus Event Recorders. The DVM-250 Plus is a rear-view mirror based digital audio and video recording system with many, but not all of, the features of our DVM-750 mirror systems at a lower price point. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture &#8220;events,&#8221; such as wrecks and erratic driving or other abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. These potential markets may find our units attractive from both a feature and cost perspective, compared to other providers. Our marketing efforts indicate that these commercial fleets are adopting this technology, in particular the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.

&#160; 

Miniature Body-Worn Digital Video System &#8211; FirstVU HD 

&#160; 

This system is also a derivative of our in-car video systems, but is much smaller and lighter, more rugged and water-resistant to handle a hostile outdoor environment. These systems can be used in many applications and are designed specifically to be clipped to an individual&#8217;s pocket or other outer clothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage devices. Current systems offered by competitors are digital based, but generally require a battery pack and/or storage device to be connected to the camera by wire or other means. We believe that our FirstVU HD product is more desirable for potential users than our competitors&#8217; offerings because of its video quality, small size, shape and lightweight characteristics . Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems. 

&#160; 

Compact HD Quality In-Car Digital Video (not in a rear-view mirror)-MicroVu HD 

&#160; 

The MicroVu is a compact in-car video system that is mobile (not mounted in a rear-view mirror) which provides up to 1080p HD video recording. The MicroVu is very compact as the complete system is only 4&#8221; long by 1&#8221; high. The MicroVu is designed for simple installation and features advanced automatic login (RFID log-in) and interoperability with our body cameras through our VuLink products. 

&#160; 

All-Weather Mobile Digital Video Systems &#8211; DVM-440 Ultra 

&#160; 

These systems are derivatives of our in-car video systems, but are more rugged and water-proofed to handle a more hostile outdoor environment. These systems can be used in many applications and are designed specifically for use on motorcycles, ATVs and boats. The MicroVu is a smaller system than the DVM-440 Ultra measuring three inches by four and one-quarter inches by one inch and is designed for easy and unobtrusive use. Current systems are digital and VHS-based with cameras mounted in the frame of the motorcycle, ATV or boat and the recording device generally in the saddle-bag or other compartment. Most manufacturers have already developed or at least have begun transitioning to digital video, but many have had problems obtaining the appropriate technology. 

&#160; 

VuLink, FleetVU Manager and VuVault.net 

&#160; 

The VuLink system provides our law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from multiple vantage points in order to more fully capture an event and it allows the operator to quickly and easily reassemble the various recording devices. The VuLink enables body cameras and in-car video systems to be automatically or manually activated simultaneously. 

&#160; 

VuVault.net is a cost-effective, fully expandable, law enforcement cloud storage solution powered by Microsoft Azur e that provides redundant and security-enhanced storage of all uploaded videos. 

&#160; 

FleetVU Manager is our web-based software for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring that features and manages video captured by our Video Event Data Recorders of incidents that require attention, such as accidents. This software solution features our cloud-based web portal that utilizes many of the features of our VUVault.NET law-enforcement cloud-based storage solution. 

&#160; 

Hand-Held Speed Detection System &#8211; Laser Ally 

&#160; 

This system is a lightweight, hand-held speed detection device that uses LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology rather than the traditional radar systems, which use sound waves. LIDAR systems are used in high congestion traffic areas that require extreme accuracy and identification of the subject vehicles. This system uses new technology that prevents the Laser Ally from being detected by current detectors or jammed by current jamming devices. This system was developed and manufactured by a third party vendor for us. 

&#160; 

Other Products 

&#160; 

During the last year, we have focused our research and development efforts to meet the varying needs of our customers, enhance our existing products and commence development of new products and product categories. Our research and development efforts are intended to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the market niche we have carved out, as well as positioning us to compete in diverse markets outside of law enforcement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Market and Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Historically, our primary market has been domestic and international law enforcement agencies. In 2012, we expanded our scope by pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. In the future, given sufficient capital and market opportunity, we may address markets for private security, homeland security, general consumer and commercial. We have made inroads into certain commercial fleet and the ambulance service provider market, confirming that our DVM-250 Plus product and FleetVU Manager can become a significant revenue producer for us. 

&#160; 

Law Enforcement 

&#160; 

We believe that a valuable use of our various digital audio/video products may be the recording of roadside sobriety tests. Without some form of video or audio recording, court proceedings usually consist of the police officer&#8217;s word against that of the suspect. Records show that conviction rates increase substantially where there is video evidence to back up officer testimony. Video evidence also helps to protect police departments against frivolous lawsuits. 

&#160; 

The largest source of police video evidence today is in-car video. Unfortunately, some police cars still do not have in-car video, and in those that do, the camera usually points forward rather than to the side of the road where the sobriety test takes place. The in-car video is typically of little use for domestic violence investigations, burglary or theft investigations, disorderly conduct calls or physical assaults. In all of these cases, the FirstVU HD may provide recorded evidence of the suspect&#8217;s actions and reactions to police intervention. 

&#160; 

Additionally, motorcycle patrolmen rarely have video systems. We have developed the DVM-440 Ultra as a mobile application of our digital video recording system that can be used by motorcycle police and water patrol. 

&#160; 

Crime scene investigations, including detailed photography, are typically a large part of the budgets of metropolitan police forces. The FirstVU may record a significant portion of such evidence at a much lower cost for gathering, analyzing and storing data and evidence. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Other Markets 

&#160; 

There are numerous potential applications for our digital audio/video camera products. We believe that other markets for our digital video systems, including the derivatives currently being developed, include private investigators, SWAT team members, over-the-road trucking fleets, airport security, municipal fire departments, and the U.S. military. Other commercial markets for our digital video systems include real estate appraisers, plumbers and electricians. 

&#160; 

Schools 

&#160; 

We believe our products and offerings may be of benefit in kindergarten through twelve grade school systems. We are currently assessing our entry into this potential market. 

&#160; 

Medical applications 

&#160; 

We believe our products and offerings may be of benefit in hospital and other medical services delivery systems. We are currently assessing our entry into this potential market. 

&#160; 

Private Security Companies 

&#160; 

There are thousands of private security agencies in the United States employing a large number of guards. Police forces use video systems for proof of correct conduct by officers, but private security services usually have no such tool. We believe that the FirstVU HD is an excellent management tool for these companies to monitor conduct and timing of security rounds. In addition to the FirstVU HD, the digital video security camera can provide fill-in security when guards have large areas to cover or in areas that do not have to be monitored around the clock. 

&#160; 

Homeland Security Market 

&#160; 

In addition to the government, U.S. corporations are spending heavily for protection against the potential of terrorist attacks. Public and private-sector outlays for antiterrorism measures and for protection against other forms of violence are significant. These are potential markets for our products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We have entered into contracts with manufacturers for the assembly of the printed circuit boards used in our products. Dedicated circuit board manufacturers are well-suited to the assembly of circuit boards with the complexity found in our products. Dedicated board manufacturers can spread the extensive capital equipment costs of circuit board assembly among multiple projects and customers. Such manufacturers also have the volume to enable the frequent upgrade to state-of-the-art equipment. We have identified multiple suppliers who meet our quality, cost, and performance criteria. We intend to use more than one source for circuit board assembly to ensure a reliable supply over time. We use contract manufacturers to manufacture our component subassemblies and may eventually use them to perform final assembly and testing. Due to the complexity of our products, we believe that it is important to maintain a core of knowledgeable production personnel for consistent quality and to limit the dissemination of sensitive intellectual property and will continue this practice. In addition, such technicians are valuable in our service and repair business to support our growing installed customer base. We had a non-exclusive supply and distribution agreement with DragonEye Technology, LLC (&#8220;Dragoneye&#8221;) regarding the sale and distribution of our Laser Ally product. This vendor developed and was the only manufacturer of this product. We have terminated our exclusive contract with Dragoneye and continue to sell and service this product on a nonexclusive basis. See &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; for further details. 

&#160; 

We also contract with a manufacturer in Asia for the production of our DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-440 Ultra, DVM-250 Plus and DVM-800 products. The contract has no minimum purchase requirements and has an initial term through July 2016. We have the right to exercise three additional options to extend the contract for three additional years each. We are exploring the retention of one or more new contract manufacturers for these product lines and are in the process of terminating our relationship with our current contract manufacturer. 

&#160; 

License Arrangements 

&#160; 

We have entered into several agreements, including agreements with Sasken-Ingenient Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Sasken&#8221;), Lead Technologies (&#8220;Lead&#8221;) and Pixel Forensics, Inc. (&#8220;Pixel), to license certain software products to be used in our video products. The licensors have written certain software for specific Texas Instrument chips which are included in our products or media analytics such as face redaction software. The licenses generally require upfront payments and contain automatic renewal provisions unless either party notifies the other of its intent to not renew prior to expiration or unless the agreement is terminated due to a material breach by the other party. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of our license agreements as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160; 

License Type &#160; Effective Date &#160; Expiration Date &#160; Terms Production software license agreement &#160; April 2005 &#160; April 2016 &#160; Automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party. Software sublicense agreement &#160; October 2007 &#160; October 2016 &#160; Automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party. Media analytics &#160; June 2015 &#160; May 2016 &#160; Either party may unilaterally terminate this agreement by written notice to the other party. &#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

In recent years, we have changed principally to an employee-based, direct sales force for domestic selling efforts that enables us to control and monitor its daily activities. In this connection, we have reduced the size of certain territories and consequently increased the sales personnel and changed the number of domestic sales territories to 21 in order to better penetrate the market. The direct territory sales team is supported by a team of 9 inside sales coordinators, and a telesales specialist and a pre-sales solution design team. We have also added two bid specialists to coordinate large bid opportunities. We believe our employee-based model encourages our sales personnel in lower performing territories to improve their efforts and, consequently, their sales results. Our executive team also supports sales agents with significant customer opportunities by providing pricing strategies and customer presentation assistance. Our technical support personnel may also provide sales agents with customer presentations and product specifications in order to facilitate sales activities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We use our direct sales force and international distributors to market our products. Our key promotional activities include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; attendance at industry trade shows and conventions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; direct sales, with a force of industry-specific sales individuals who identify, call upon and build on-going relationships with key purchasers and targeted industries; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; support of our direct sales with passive sales systems, including inside sales and e-commerce; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; print advertising in journals with specialized industry focus; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; direct mail campaigns targeted to potential customers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; web advertising, including supportive search engines and website and registration with appropriate sourcing entities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; public relations, industry-specific venues, as well as general media, to create awareness of our brand and our products, including membership in appropriate trade organizations; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; brand identification through trade names associated with us and our products. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The law enforcement and security surveillance markets are extremely competitive. Competitive factors in these industries include ease of use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct companies with competitive technology and products in the law enforcement and surveillance markets for all of our products and those we have in development. Many of these competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger customer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., Watchguard, Kustom Signals, Panasonic System Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell or may in the future sell in-car video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include TASER International, Inc. and VieVU, Inc. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our event recorders in the commercial fleets and mass transit markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. We will also compete with any company making surveillance devices for commercial use. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that new and existing companies will not enter the law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future. 

&#160; 

The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets are also very competitive. There are direct competitors for our DVM-250 Plus &#8220;event recorders&#8221; which several may have greater financial, technical marketing, and manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and SmartDrive Systems. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our products. However, we license the critical technology on which our products are based from third parties, including Sasken-Ingenient Technologies, Inc. and Lead Technologies. 

&#160; 

Some of these patent applications are still under review by the U.S. Patent Office and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all of the patents that we applied for in the United States. We were issued several patents during 2014 including a patent on our VuLink product which provides automatic bi-directional triggering of our body-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing technology will be issued from the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on our continued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United States will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies. 

&#160; 

We have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our Laser Ally, FirstVU HD, DVM-100, DVM-250, DVM-500 Ultra, and DVM-800 products. These supply and distribution agreements contain certain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary technology, as well as that of the third party manufacturers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. 

&#160; 

Taser International, Inc. (&#8220;TASER&#8221;) a competitor in our body-camera market, requested that the United States Patent &#38; Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) commence an ex parte reexamination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (&#8217;292 Patent). The USPTO granted this request and has completed its reexamination. The USPTO has confirmed the validity of our &#8217;292 patent which relates to our auto-activation technology for law enforcement body cameras. We have filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against TASER, alleging willful patent infringement against TASER&#8217;s Axon body camera product line. On February 2, 2016, we received notification that the USPTO has issued another patent relating to its auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (&#8220;the &#8217;452 patent&#8221;) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle. We have added TASERs willful infringement of the &#8217;452 patent to our existing lawsuit. 

&#160; 

Despite the USPTO&#8217;s recognition of the validity of the &#8217;292 patent and &#8217;452 patent, TASER continues to offer for sale, sell, and market its Axon technology in disregard of our federally protected patent rights. As a result, we are aggressively challenging TASER&#8217;s infringing conduct in our lawsuit against it, seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction preventing TASER from continuing to sell its Axon Signal technology. 

&#160; 

We believe the outcome of this infringement lawsuit will have meaningful effects upon the entire body-worn camera market within the United States over the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had 154 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#160;
