Organizational History 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 28, 2009 to provide 3D rendering, animation and architectural visualization services using advanced computer technology to produce photo realistic 3D rendering, walk-through animation and 360-degree panorama. We are now a holding company primarily engaged in the emerging live and digital music space content, including live music events, through LiveXLive, Corp., our operating subsidiary. As more fully described below, we have three direct subsidiaries, LiveXLive, Corp., KOKO (Camden) Holdings (US), Inc. and KOKO (Camden) UK Limited, the results of which we consolidate for our financial reporting purposes, and two indirect investment subsidiaries, Obar Camden Holdings Limited (&#8220;OCHL&#8221;) and Obar Camden, Ltd. (&#8220;OCL&#8221;).

&#160;

On April 28, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Loton Acquisition Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;Acquisition Sub&#8221;), and KOKO (Camden) Holdings (US), Inc. (&#8220;KOKO Parent&#8221;), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of JJAT Corp. (&#8220;JJAT&#8221;), a Delaware corporation wholly-owned by Mr. Ellin and his affiliates. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into KOKO Parent and KOKO Parent became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). As a result of the Merger, our primary business at such time became that of KOKO Parent and its subsidiaries, KOKO (Camden) Limited, a private limited company registered in England and Wales (&#8220;KOKO UK&#8221;) which owns 50% of OBAR Camden Holdings Limited, a private limited company registered in England and Wales (&#8220;OCHL&#8221;) which in turn wholly-owns its operating subsidiary OBAR Camden Limited, a private limited company registered in England and Wales (&#8220;OCL&#8221;). Upon the closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, JJAT received 29,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 77% of our issued and outstanding common stock immediately after the Merger.

&#160;

On February 24, 2015, we formed LiveXLive, Corp. (formerly FestreamTV, Corp.), our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, to engage in the emerging live and digital music space.

Business Overview 

&#160;

We are a holding company primarily engaged in the emerging live and digital music space, including live music events, through LXL, our operating subsidiary. LXL intends to be the world's first premium live music streaming network that will deliver around the clock live music to viewers on any connected device as an authentic and experiential platform. The platform plans to offer the world's leading music festivals with multiday and multistage coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and cutting edge programming. We plan to extend the live experience to fans on desktop, laptop, mobile, tablets, consoles, connected TVs and virtual reality platforms. The LiveXLive network expects to provide compelling and curated content that showcases the entire spectrum of music to include music inspired fashion, food, and lifestyle content and showcase interviews, backstage access and both fan and artist perspectives. We intend to feature all genres of music including rock, pop, indie, alternative, EDM, country and feature major festival headliners as well as emerging artists performing at clubs and venues around the globe. LXL&#8217;s website is www.livexlive.com.

&#160;

LXL&#8217;s mission is to aggregate thousands of hours of live music and content driven by live music through mutually beneficially relationships with the world&#8217;s top talent, music companies, festivals and promoters. LXL plans to showcase professionally produced, innovative, immersive and experiential live broadcasts in HD. Fans will have the opportunity to see their favorite festivals, concerts and experiences on any screen they choose across all video platforms and devices from mobile to the home. These fans will be able to view concert experiences from any connected device with exclusive access only LXL brings from the stage to backstage, inside dressing rooms, and places previously off limits to anyone but VIPs and artists.

&#160; 

In addition, as a result of our 50% ownership in OCHL and our indirect, 50%-owned ownership of OCL, we indirectly engage in the operations of KOKO. KOKO provides live shows, club nights, corporate and other events at KOKO as well as digital broadcasts. The venue has been used to record live performances which have been broadcast to an international audience.

&#160; 

Business Objective 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to provide the first independent global live music and lifestyle streaming network delivering around the clock live music to viewers on any connected device as an authentic and experiential platform to grow revenue, earnings and cash flow. LXL will provide consumers with the opportunity to view the most sought after live music around the globe via any distribution channel on a 24/7/365 basis. The platform will offer the world&#8217;s leading music festivals with multi-day and multi-stage coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and cutting edge programming.

&#160;

The LXL network plans to provide compelling and curated content that showcases the entire spectrum of music to include music inspired fashion, food, and lifestyle content and showcase interviews, back stage access and both fan and artist perspectives. We will extend the live experience to fans on desktop, laptop, mobile, tablets, consoles, connected TV&#8217;s and virtual reality platforms. LXL will feature all genres of music including rock, pop, indie, alternative, EDM, country and feature major festival headliners as well as emerging artists performing at clubs and venues around the globe. LXL is also developing key strategic relationships in technology, distribution, advertising, mobile and virtual reality to augment its network delivery strategy. LXL anticipates generating its revenues from subscription fees from users and from advertising sales.

&#160;

In addition, we plan to leverage KOKO&#8217;s success and brand in live entertainment and relationships with fans, artists and advertisers to capture originated content, create owned/co-owned branded activity and develop new and complimentary brand extensions and intellectual property. We will need additional capital to drive this process and address present working capital expenditures.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

LiveXLive 

&#160;

Live streamed music is the only remaining media genre without a dominant brand. While sports has ESPN, long-form content has HBO, and news has CNN, there is a tremendous amount of high quality live music content available without a home. LXL is partnering with rights holders and their influencers (agencies, promoters, venues, artists and record labels) to build optimal digital strategies thereby increasing revenues for participants in the music world.

&#160; &#160; 

LXL expects to compete for the time and attention of its users with other content providers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and diversity of content, ease of use, price, accessibility, perceptions of ad load, brand awareness and reputation. LXL also expects to compete for users on the basis of its presence and visibility as compared with other providers that deliver content through the internet, mobile devices and consumer products.

&#160;

LXL&#8217;s competitors will include (i) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers such as Clear Channel and CBS and satellite radio providers such as Sirius XM, (ii) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music Store and Apple Music, RDIO, Rhapsody, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Amazon that allow listeners to stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase and (iii) other forms of entertainment, including Facebook (including Instagram), Google, Twitter (including Periscope), Yahoo, and Meerkat which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. To the extent existing or potential users choose to watch satellite or cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Hulu, VEVO or YouTube or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than use the LXL service, these content services pose a competitive threat.

&#160;

Our Investment Interest in KOKO 

&#160;

With regards to OCHL and our investment interest in KOKO, competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. We believe that KOKO competes primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality music events and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. We believe that KOKO&#8217;s primary strengths include:

&#160;

&#183; the quality of service delivered to artists, fans and corporate sponsors; &#183; a track record in producing live music concerts, club nights and corporate events at KOKO; and &#183; a track record in producing live music concerts, club nights and corporate events at KOKO; and artist relationships. &#160;

Although we believe that KOKO&#8217;s products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we cannot provide any assurance that KOKO can maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater brand recognition, or financial, marketing, support, technical and other resources.

&#160;

In the markets in which KOKO produces music concerts, it faces competition from both promoters and other venue operators. We believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations. KOKO&#8217;s main competitors in the live music industry include all other live music venues in London including without limitation the Forum, Electric Brixton, the Electric Ballroom, the Village Underground and the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire. Some of KOKO&#8217;s competitors in the live music industry may have greater financial resources than we do which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us.

&#160;

Material Contracts Impacting Our Investment Interest in KOKO 

&#160;

The OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement 

&#160;

On February 12, 2014, (1) Mr. Bengough, and (2) KOKO UK, Mr. Ellin, Trinad Master Fund (collectively, the &#8220;Ellin Parties&#8221;) and (3) OCHL entered into a Shareholders&#8217; Agreement (the &#8220;OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which, amongst other terms, the parties agreed that each of Mr. Ellin and Mr. Bengough shall constitute the Board of Directors of OCHL and each shall be restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL without the written consent of the other individual, including, but not limited to, changes in the nature of the business, amendments to governing documents, restructuring or recapitalizations, issuances of stock, purchases of material assets, entry into material contracts, incurring or guaranteeing debt, removal of any director or restructure the board of OCHL. Because OCHL is the sole parent of OCL, our ability to manage OCHL and OCL is subject to the terms of the OCHL Shareholder Agreement and Mr. Bengough&#8217;s consent is required for most material actions to be taken by OCHL and OCL, so long as the OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement remains in effect. Each of Mr. Bengough and Mr. Ellin are entitled to serve on the board of OCHL so long as the OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement is in effect, and the board cannot take action without the consent of both board members. Pursuant to the OCHL Shareholder Agreement, any cash distributions by OCHL must be distributed pro rata to each of KOKO UK and Mr. Bengough. Finally, the OCHL Shareholder Agreement restricts the transfer of shares in OCHL or OCL by KOKO UK or Mr. Bengough and grants each a right of first refusal and the right to have the proposed shares valued by an independent accounting firm and sold to the other party at a price determined by valuation rather than the price necessarily offered by the prospective purchaser.

&#160;

Variation to Shareholders Agreement 

&#160;

On April 24, 2014, the OCHL Shareholders Agreement was amended pursuant to the terms of the Variation to Shareholders Agreement (&#8220;Variation Agreement&#8221;) among Mr. Bengough, KOKO UK, the Ellin Parties, OCHL, OCL, JJAT and our Company which, amongst other terms, (1) joined OCL, JJAT and the Company as parties to the OCHL Shareholders Agreement, and (2) Mr. Bengough also agreed to transfer all of his interests in OCHL in exchange for 29,000,000 shares of our common stock to be issued in a private placement transaction, which would constitute no less than 42.5% of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis (but before our future issuance of up to 3,200,000 shares of our common stock to our advisors, consultants and key employees as approved by our Board of Directors) and pursuant to the OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement, subject to Mr. Bengough&#8217;s receipt of satisfactory tax clearances under the tax laws of the United Kingdom. We agreed to indemnify Mr. Bengough from any adverse tax expenses and costs required to be paid by Mr. Bengough in connection with the transfer of his interests in OCHL. To date, the parties to the Variation Agreement have been unable to reach an agreement on mutually acceptable documentation to effect the share exchange described above. We are presently continuing to co-operate with Mr. Bengough in leading OCHL&#8217;s day-to-day business.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Variation Agreement and the related OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement remain in full force and effect, subject to any court mandated changes or orders made with respect to the Petition (for a detailed discussion of the Petition, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings). Pursuant to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement and Variation Agreement, each of Mr. Ellin and Mr. Bengough constitute the Board of Directors of OCHL and each of Mr. Bengough and Mr. Ellin are restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL without the written consent of the other individual.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, we had 4 full-time employees including our executive assistant, and a consultant that serves as LXL&#8217;s Chief Revenue Officer. Other than as noted here, we presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to our business limited time until funding and capital resources are available to implement our plan of operations.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, OCL, our 50% owned investment, had approximately 60 full-time employees including 8 salaried positions for operations, sales and marketing, and administration. OCL&#8217;s weekly staffing needs vary throughout the year depending upon the number and type of events appearing at KOKO and consist principally of personnel associated with running the bar and coatroom. OCL also hires third party providers for KOKO security, cleaning and technical crews. 

&#160;

Going Concern 

&#160; 

We are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment and other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations. We may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing, from financial institutions or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report in our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 to the effect that our losses from operations and our negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We may be required to cease operations which could result in our stockholders losing all or almost all of their investment.

&#160;

Management Agreement 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2011, we entered into a Management Agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;) with Trinad Management, LLC (&#8220;Trinad Management&#8221;). Pursuant to the Management Agreement, Trinad Management has agreed to provide certain management services to us for a period of 3 years, including, without limitation, the sourcing, structuring and negotiation of business combination transactions involving us. Under the Management Agreement, we compensate Trinad Management for its services to us with (i) a fee equal to $2,080,000, with $90,000 payable in advance of each consecutive 3-month period during the term of the Management Agreement and with $1,000,000 due at the end of the 3-year term unless the Management Agreement is otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, and (ii) issued a warrant to purchase 1,125,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per share. The warrant may be exercised in whole or in part by Trinad Management at any time for a period of 10 years from the date of the Management Agreement.

&#160;

The payment of the $1,000,000 fee has been accrued and reflected as a liability as of March 31, 2016 and 2015. Trinad Management continues to provide service at $30,000 per month on a month-to-month basis.

&#160;

Properties 

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are subleased from Trinad Management LLC for no cost to us where we maintain a 1,840 sq. ft. office space. We anticipate to continue to sublease such space at no cost to us for the foreseeable future. We believe that such property is in good condition and is suitable for the conduct of our business. We currently have no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.
