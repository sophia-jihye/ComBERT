&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. is a Florida corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) formed in 2004 as a bank holding company for OptimumBank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s only business is the ownership and operation of the Bank and its Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries. The Bank is a Florida state chartered bank established in 2000, with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Bank offers a variety of community banking services to individual and corporate customers through its three banking offices located in Broward County, Florida. The Bank has 8 wholly-owned subsidiaries primarily engaged in holding and disposing of foreclosed real estate and one subsidiary primarily engaged in managing foreclosed real estate. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). OptimumBank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation (&#8220;OFR&#8221;) and the FDIC. OptimumBank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had total assets of $127.5 million, net loans of $82.6 million, total deposits of $97.6 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $3.0 million. During 2015, the Company lost $163,000. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Consent Order, Amended Consent Order, and Written Agreement . 

&#160; 

On April 16, 2010, the Bank agreed to the issuance of the Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR (the &#8220;Consent Order&#8221;), which required the Bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness. Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Bank was required to take certain measures to improve its capital position, reduce its level of problem assets, reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios, improve management practices and board supervision and assure that its allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level. Among the corrective actions required were for the Bank to have and maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12% beginning 90 days from the issuance of the Consent Order. Effective February 28, 2014, the Bank agreed to the issuance of an Amended Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR. 

&#160; 

In addition to the Consent Order, on June 22, 2010, the Company entered into a Written Agreement, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which required the Company to take certain measures to ensure the Bank complied with the Consent Order. Under the Written Agreement, the Company is subject to restrictions on paying interest on debt, or paying dividends or distributions of stock, including its common stock, as well as incurring additional debt or redeeming stock. Additional details on the Consent Order and the Written Agreement are contained in &#8220;Business-Supervision and Regulation- Consent Order- and -Written Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.59%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 11.40%. At December 31, 2015, the Bank would have needed approximately $541,000 in additional capital in order to comply with the total risk-based capital ratio requirement of the Consent Order. Additional information on the Bank&#8217;s capital adequacy is contained in &#8220;Item 7- Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Company is in technical default with respect to its $5,155,000 Junior Subordinated Debenture (&#8220;Debenture&#8221;). The holders of the debenture could demand payment of the $5,155,000 principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest totaling $955,000 at December 31, 2015. No adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been made as a result of this uncertainty. Management&#8217;s plans with regard to this matter are as follows: A director of the Company has agreed to purchase the Debenture and has agreed to provide a forbearance of the payment to the Company upon consummation of the purchase. Although the agreed upon purchase price for the Debenture has been tendered, the Trustee of the Debenture (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;) has received conflicting direction and therefore on December 11, 2014, the Trustee commenced an Action for Interpleader in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#8220;Debenture Litigation&#8221;). On August 31, 2015, the court held that theTrustee could not sell the Debenture to the Director because certain conditions and requirements set forth in the indenture for the Trust had not been fulfilled. The Director intends to continue his efforts to acquire the Debenture. Based upon the underlying Debenture documents, Management does not believe the Trustee will call a Default at this time. The Company is continuing to pursue regulatory approval for the interest payment and other mechanisms for paying the accrued interest such as raising additional capital. 

&#160; 

Banking Products 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s revenues are primarily derived from interest on, and fees received in connection with, real estate, and other loans, and from interest from mortgage-backed securities and short-term investments. The principal sources of funds for the Bank&#8217;s lending activities are deposits, borrowings, repayment of loans, and the repayment, or maturity of investment securities. The Bank&#8217;s principal expenses are the interest paid on deposits, and operating and general administrative expenses. 

&#160; 

As is the case with banking institutions generally, the Bank&#8217;s operations are materially and significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds. The Bank faces strong competition attracting deposits (its primary source of lendable funds) and originating loans. 

&#160; 

The Bank provides a range of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals and businesses. The basic services offered include: demand interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing accounts, money market deposit accounts, NOW accounts, time deposits, Visa debit and ATM cards, cash management, direct deposits, notary services, money orders, night depository, cashier&#8217;s checks, domestic collections, drive-in tellers, and banking by mail. The Bank makes residential and commercial real estate loans and consumer loans. The Bank offers business lending lines for working capital needs. Growing businesses can use the loans to expand inventory, take discounts, offset receivables, or establish new structured financing and repayment plans that are consistent with the cash flow of the business. The Bank provides ATM cards and Visa debit cards, as a part of the Star, Presto and Cirrus networks, thereby permitting customers to utilize the convenience of ATMs worldwide. The Bank does not have trust powers and provides no trust services. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s continuing goal is to become one of the leading community banking organizations in Broward County, Florida through steady, reasonable and controlled growth and a prudent operating strategy. 

&#160; 

The operating and business strategies emphasize the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; Local management and local decision making resulting in rapid, personalized customer service, rapid credit decisions and expedited closings; 

&#160; 

&#183; Maintaining a presence in Broward County through a branch network. Currently, the Bank has three branch banking offices in Broward County; 

&#160; 

&#183; Real estate, commercial and consumer lending activities by originating fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans for Bank customers; 

&#160; 

&#183; Maintaining high credit quality through strict underwriting criteria through the Bank&#8217;s knowledge of the real estate values and borrowers in its market area; 

&#160; 

&#183; Personalized products and service by striving to provide innovative financial products, high service levels and to maintain strong customer relationships. The Bank seeks customers who prefer to conduct business with a locally owned and managed institution. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s management is focusing its efforts on a long-term strategy with the following objectives: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Stabilize the Loan Portfolio - Management devotes significant resources to the identification and workout of problem loans and has been successful in reducing same. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Increase and Diversify Loan Originations - Management is focused on increasing its loan production to add more interest bearing assets and interest income to its asset base and has increased same. In addition, management is diversifying its loan originations and portfolio to include commercial and consumer loans, in addition to residential and commercial real estate loans. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Lower the Cost of Deposits - Management is focused on changing the Bank&#8217;s deposit mix by replacing higher cost interest bearing time deposits with non-interest bearing demand deposits, which has occurred. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increase Capital Ratios - Management continues to seek additional sources of capital to increase the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios, allow the Bank to grow, implement its business plan and return to profitability. 

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

The Bank offers real estate, commercial and consumer loans, to individuals and small businesses and other organizations that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in its market area. The Bank&#8217;s market area consists of the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. The Bank&#8217;s net loans at December 31, 2015 were $82.6 million, or 64.8% of total assets. The interest rates charged on loans varied with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan, and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations. The Bank has no foreign loans. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio is concentrated in two major areas: residential and commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2015, 73.4% of the loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by mortgages on real estate, of which approximately 28.6% of the total loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The real estate loans are located primarily in the tri-county market area. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s real estate loans are secured by mortgages and consist primarily of loans to individuals and businesses for the purchase or improvement of, or investment in, real estate. These real estate loans were made at fixed or variable interest rates and are normally adjustable rate mortgages which adjust annually after the initial three to five year period. The Bank&#8217;s fixed rate loans generally are for terms of five years or less, and are repayable in monthly installments based on a maximum 30-year amortization schedule. 

&#160; 

Loan originations are derived primarily from director and employee referrals, existing customers, and direct marketing. Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions including interest rates, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. A significant portion of the Bank&#8217;s portfolio is collateralized by real estate in South Florida, which is susceptible to local economic downturns. The Bank attempts to minimize credit losses through various means. On larger credits, it relies on the cash flow and assets of a debtor as the source of repayment as well as the value of the underlying collateral. The Bank also generally limits its loans to up to 80% of the value of the underlying real estate collateral. The Bank generally charges a prepayment penalty if a loan is repaid within the first two to three years of origination to recover any costs it paid for the origination of the loan. 

&#160; 

Deposit Activities 

&#160; 

Deposits are the major source of the Bank&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment activities. The Bank considers the majority of its regular savings, demand, NOW, money market deposit accounts and CD&#8217;s under $100,000 to be core deposits. These accounts comprised approximately 67.0% of the Bank&#8217;s total deposits at December 31, 2015. Approximately 65.7% of the deposits at December 31, 2015 were certificates of deposit. Generally, the Bank attempts to maintain the rates paid on its deposits at a competitive level. Time deposits of $100,000 and over made up approximately 33.0% of the Bank&#8217;s total deposits at December 31, 2015. Although these large deposits are not traditionally considered core deposits, the majority of these deposits have served as a stable source of funds in the Bank&#8217;s targeted market. The majority of the deposits are generated from Broward County. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s investment securities portfolio was approximately $25.7 million and $26.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing 20.2% and 21.5% of its total assets. At December 31, 2015, approximately 97% of this portfolio was invested in asset-backed securities. Mortgage backed securities generally have a shorter life than the stated maturity. The Bank&#8217;s investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth, and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at minimal risk levels while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits. 

&#160; 

The Excess Balance Account is the excess cash the Bank has available over and above daily cash needs. This money is invested on an overnight basis with the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

Correspondent Banking 

&#160; 

Correspondent banking involves one bank providing services to another bank which cannot provide that service for itself from an economic or practical standpoint. OptimumBank is required to purchase correspondent services offered by larger banks, including check collections, purchase of federal funds, security safekeeping, investment services, coin and currency supplies, and sales of loans to or participations with correspondent banks. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

OptimumBank has established a correspondent relationship with Independent Bankers Bank of Florida. The Bank pays for such services in cash as opposed to keeping compensating balances. The Bank also sells loan participations to other banks with respect to loans which exceed its lending limit. 

&#160; 

Data Processing 

&#160; 

The Bank outsources most of its data processing services, including an automated general ledger and deposit accounting; however, it services all its loans in-house. 

&#160; 

Internet Banking 

&#160; 

The Bank maintains a website at www.optimumbank.com where retail and business customers can access account balances, view current account activity and their previous statement, view images of paid checks, transfer funds between accounts, and bill payment. The Bank now offers its retail customers mobile access to their account information, with the option to setup alerts, deposit checks across a broad range of phones and mobile devices. The Bank now offers its business customers remote deposit capture and online cash management services that include ACH origination and wire transfers using token technology for security. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

OptimumBank encounters strong competition both making loans and attracting deposits. The deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws which permit multi-bank holding companies as well as an increasing level of interstate banking have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking. In one or more aspects of its business, OptimumBank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Most of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits, and may offer certain services that OptimumBank does not currently provide. In addition, many of its non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern federally insured banks. Recent federal and state legislation has heightened the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business, and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly. The Bank focuses its efforts on smaller loans, which is generally neglected by its competitors. 

&#160; 

To compete, OptimumBank relies upon specialized services, responsive handling of customer needs, and personal contacts by its officers, directors, and staff. Large multi-branch banking competitors tend to compete primarily by rate and the number and location of branches while smaller, independent financial institutions tend to compete primarily by rate and personal service. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had seventeen full-time employees, including executive officers. These employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Bank considers its relations with employees good. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

Banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, regulations and enforcement actions affecting OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. and OptimumBank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the business of the Company or the Bank. Supervision, regulation, and examination of banks by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, rather than shareholders. 

&#160; 

(8) Regulatory Matters. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the regulatory banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company and Bank&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. &#160; &#160; &#160; Effective April 16, 2010, the Bank consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR. Effective February 28, 2014, the Consent Order was amended (collectively, the &#8220;Consent Order&#8221;). Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Bank is subject to higher capital ratios. According to the Consent Order, the Bank is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; even if its capital ratios were to exceed those generally required to be a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; bank. At September 30, 2015, the Bank is adequately capitalized. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank became subject to new capital requirements set forth by federal banking regulations. These changes were designed to ensure capital positions remain strong during the events of economic downturns or unforeseen losses. The Company is exempt from consolidated capital requirements as the Federal Reserve Board amended its &#8220;small bank holding company&#8221; policy statement to generally exempt bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in assets from capital requirements. 

&#160; 

Under the new capital regulation for the Bank, the minimum capital ratios consist of a common equity tier 1 ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a tier 1 capital of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets, a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%. Common equity tier 1 is generally comprised of common stock, additional paid in capital, and retained earnings. 

&#160; 

These new requirements create a new capital ratio for common equity Tier 1 capital and increase the Tier 1 capital ratio requirements. There were changes in the risk weight of certain assets to better reflect the risk associated with those assets, such as the risk weighting for non-performing loans and certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisitions, development and construction loans. The changes also include additional limitations to the inclusion of deferred tax assets in capital. The Bank made a one-time election to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on regulatory capital. 

&#160; 

The following table shows the Bank&#8217;s capital amounts and ratios and regulatory thresholds at December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

&#160; The Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). On June 22, 2010, the Company entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (&#8220;Reserve Bank&#8221;) with respect to certain aspects of the operation and management of the Company (the &#8220;Written Agreement&#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; The Written Agreement contains the following principal requirements: &#160; 

&#160; &#183; The Board of the Company must take appropriate steps to fully utilize the Company&#8217;s financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to the Bank, including, but not limited to, taking steps to ensure that the Bank complies with the Consent Order entered into with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (&#8220;OFR&#8221;) and the FDIC and any other supervisory action taken by the Bank&#8217;s state or federal regulator. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Company may not declare or pay any dividends without prior Reserve Bank and Federal Reserve approval. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Company may not, directly or indirectly, take dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the Bank without prior Reserve Bank approval. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Company and its nonconsolidated subsidiary, OptimumBank Holdings Capital Trust I, may not make any distributions of interest, principal, or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The Company and its nonconsolidated subsidiary, OptimumBank Holdings Capital Trust I, may not, directly or indirectly, incur, increase, or guarantee any debt or purchase or redeem any shares of its stock without the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Company must obtain prior written consent from the Reserve Bank before appointing any new director or senior executive officer, or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior executive officer position, and must comply with the regulations applicable to indemnification and severance payments. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Company must provide quarterly progress reports to the Reserve Bank, along with parent company only financial statements. &#160; 

&#160; Effective April 16, 2010, the Bank consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR. Effective February 28, 2014, the Consent Order was amended (collectively, the &#8220; Consent Order &#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; The Consent Order represents an agreement among the Bank, the FDIC and the OFR as to areas of the Bank&#8217;s operations that warrant improvement and presents a plan for making those improvements. The Consent Order imposes no fines or penalties on the Bank. The Consent Order will remain in effect and enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the FDIC and the OFR. &#160; &#160; &#160; The Consent Order as amended contains the following principal requirements: &#160; 

&#160; &#183; The Board of the Bank is required to increase its participation in the affairs of the Bank, assuming full responsibility for the approval of sound policies and objectives and for the supervision of all of the Bank&#8217;s activities, consistent with the role and expertise commonly expected for directors of banks of comparable size. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank is required to have and retain qualified and appropriately experienced senior management, including a chief executive officer, a chief lending officer and a chief operating officer, who are given the authority to implement the provisions of the Consent Order. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Any proposed changes in the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors or senior executive officers are subject to the prior consent of the FDIC and the OFR. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank is required to maintain both a fully funded allowance for loan and lease losses satisfactory to the FDIC and the OFR and a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12% for as long as the Consent Order remains in effect. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall develop, adopt and implement a written plan to ensure that the Bank is in compliance with the provisions of Section 658.33(2), Florida Statutes. Such plan must address how the Bank will ensure that at least three-fifths of the members of the Bank&#8217;s Board are current residents of the State of Florida and were residents of the State of Florida for one year preceding their election to the Board, and that at least three-fifths of the members of the Bank&#8217;s Board maintain their residence in the State of Florida for so long as they continue as members of the Board. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall develop, adopt, and implement a written policy satisfactory to the Supervisory Authorities which shall govern the relationship between the Bank and its holding company and affiliates. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall retain a bank consultant who will develop a written analysis and assessment of the Bank&#8217;s Board and management needs for the purpose of providing qualified management for the Bank. &#160; &#183; The Bank shall submit a written plan to the Supervisory Authorities to reduce the remaining assets classified &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and &#8220;Substandard&#8221; in the 2013 Report or any future regulatory examination report. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall perform a risk segmentation analysis and shall develop and submit for review a revised written plan for systematically reducing and monitoring the Bank&#8217;s Commercial Real Estate Loans concentration of credit. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any additional credit to, or for the benefit of, any borrower who has a loan or other extension of credit from the Bank that has been charged-off or classified, in whole or in part, &#8220;Loss&#8221; or &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; and is uncollected. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any additional credit to, or for the benefit of, any borrower who has a loan or other extension of credit from the Bank that has been classified, in whole or part, &#8220;Substandard.&#8221; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall revise its internal loan review and grading system. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Board shall review, revise, and implement its written lending and collection policy to provide effective guidance and control over the Bank&#8217;s lending and credit administration functions. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall prepare and submit to the Supervisory Authorities an acceptable written business/strategic plan covering the overall operation of the Bank. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall implement a written plan to improve liquidity, contingency funding, interest rate risk and asset liability management. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall revise and implement a written policy for managing interest rate risk in a manner that is appropriate to the size of the Bank and the complexity of its assets. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall not accept, renew, or rollover any brokered deposit. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall not declare or pay dividends, pay bonuses, or make any other form of payment outside the ordinary course of business resulting in a reduction of capital, without the prior written approval of the Supervisory Authorities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall notify the Supervisory Authorities at least sixty days prior to undertaking asset growth that exceeds 10% or more per annum or initiating material changes in asset or liability composition. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; The Bank shall furnish written progress reports to the Supervisory Authorities within forty-five days from the end of each quarter, detailing the form and manner of any actions taken to secure compliance with this Consent Order. &#160; 

&#160; The Bank is in process of implementing comprehensive policies and plans to address all of the requirements of the Consent Order and has incorporated recommendations from the FDIC and OFR into these policies and plans. However, at December 31, 2015, the Bank was not in compliance with the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12%. &#160; &#160; &#160; As part of a routine examination by the FDIC and OFR, material weaknesses in the Bank&#8217;s Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;)/Anti-Money Laundering Program were noted. Accordingly, on July 27, 2015, the Bank entered into a BSA Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with the regulators regarding corrective measures. No fine was imposed in connection with the MOU. &#160; 

Dodd-Frank Act . On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, into law. The Dodd-Frank Act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including potentially significant regulatory and compliance changes including, among other things, (1) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (2) potential changes to capital and liquidity requirements; (3) changes to regulatory examination fees; (4) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (5) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on the Bank&#8217;s operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of the Bank&#8217;s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon it more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s business. These changes may also require the Bank to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with any such laws, regulations, or principles or changes thereto, may negatively impact the Bank&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. While the Bank cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on it, these changes could be materially adverse to its investors and shareholders. 

&#160; 

The following items provide a brief description of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Bank&#8217;s operations and activities, both currently and prospectively. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision . The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. These new standards will be no lower than existing regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may, in fact, be higher when established by the agencies. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce the Bank&#8217;s ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. The Dodd-Frank Act also increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. Compliance with new regulatory requirements and expanded examination processes could increase the Company&#8217;s cost of operations. 

&#160; 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new, independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the Bureau, within the Federal Reserve. The Bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. Generally, we will not be directly subject to the rules and regulations of the Bureau. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the Bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau against certain state-chartered institutions. Any such new regulations could increase the cost of operations and, as a result, could limit the Bank&#8217;s ability to expand into these products and services. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance . The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revise the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund, or the DIF, will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base will no longer be the institution&#8217;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Several of these provisions could increase the FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by us. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that, effective one year after the date of enactment, depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates . The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Insiders . Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening on loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits. 

&#160; 

Enhanced Lending Limits . The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower. Current banking law limits a depository institution&#8217;s ability to extend credit to one person (or group of related persons) in an amount exceeding certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 

&#160; 

Company Regulation 

&#160; 

General . As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. is subject to the regulation and supervision of, and inspection by, the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Company is also required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and other information regarding its business operations, and those of its subsidiaries. In the past, the BHCA limited the activities of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries to activities which were limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity which the Federal Reserve determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incidental thereto. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 which is discussed below, bank holding companies now have the opportunity to seek broadened authority, subject to limitations on investment, to engage in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; if all of their subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized, well managed, and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, which is also discussed below. 

&#160; 

In this regard, the BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries, unless such non-banking business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefit to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Generally, bank holding companies, such as OptimumBank Holdings, Inc., are required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve to engage in any new activity not previously approved by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Change of Control . The BHCA also requires that every bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the parties&#8217; performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (discussed below) and various competitive factors. As described in greater detail below, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Interstate Banking and Branching Act&#8221;), a bank holding company is permitted to acquire banks in states other than its home state. 

&#160; 

The BHCA further prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Bank has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company. In addition, any person or group of persons must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of a bank holding company, or otherwise obtaining control or a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Interstate Banking and Branching . The Interstate Banking and Branching Act provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching. Under the law, interstate acquisitions of banks or bank holding companies in any state by bank holding companies in any other state are permissible subject to certain limitations. Florida also has a law that allows out-of-state bank holding companies (located in states that allow Florida bank holding companies to acquire banks and bank holding companies in that state) to acquire Florida banks and Florida bank holding companies. The law essentially provides for out-of-state entry by acquisition only (and not by interstate branching) and requires the acquired Florida bank to have been in existence for at least three years. Interstate branching and consolidation of existing bank subsidiaries in different states is permissible. A Florida bank also may establish, maintain, and operate one or more branches in a state other than Florida pursuant to an interstate merger transaction in which the Florida bank is the resulting bank. 

&#160; 

Financial Modernization . The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) sought to achieve significant modernization of the federal bank regulatory framework by allowing the consolidation of banking institutions with other types of financial services firms, subject to various restrictions and requirements. In general, the GLB Act repealed most of the federal statutory barriers which separated commercial banking firms from insurance and securities firms and authorized the consolidation of such firms in a &#8220;financial services holding company.&#8221; We have no current plans to utilize the structural options created by the GLB Act. 

&#160; 

Securities Regulation and Corporate Governance . The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we are subject to restrictions, reporting requirements and review procedures under federal securities laws and regulations. The Company is also subject to the rules and reporting requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market, on which its common stock is traded. Like other issuers of publicly traded securities, the Company must also comply with the corporate governance reforms enacted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;The Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ Stock Market adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Among other things, these reforms, effective as of various dates, require certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, prohibit the provision of specified services by independent auditors, require pre-approval of independent auditor services, define director independence and require certain committees, and a majority of a subject company&#8217;s board of directors, to consist of independent directors, establish additional disclosure requirements in reports filed with the SEC, require expedited filing of reports, require management evaluation and auditor attestation of internal controls, prohibit loans by the issuer (but not by certain depository institutions) to directors and officers, set record-keeping requirements, mandate complaint procedures for the reporting of accounting and audit concerns by employees, and establish penalties for non-compliance. 

&#160; 

Bank Regulation 

&#160; 

General. OptimumBank is chartered under the laws of the State of Florida, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. OptimumBank is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, or Florida OFR, and to other laws and regulations applicable to banks. Such regulations include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; limitations on the types of activities a state bank can conduct; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; and the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit. OptimumBank is examined periodically by the FDIC and the Florida OFR, to whom it submits periodic reports regarding its financial condition and other matters. The FDIC and the Florida OFR have a broad range of powers to enforce regulations under their jurisdiction, and to take discretionary actions determined to be for the protection and safety and soundness of banks, including the institution of cease and desist orders and the removal of directors and officers. The FDIC and the Florida OFR also have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, consolidations, and similar corporate actions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Consent Order . On April 16, 2010, OptimumBank agreed to the issuance of the Consent Order with the FDIC and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. Under the Consent Order, the Bank is required to implement a number of corrective measures intended to improve the Bank&#8217;s condition, including a requirement to maintain certain minimum capital ratios. The Consent Order also contains significant operating restrictions. The principal requirements of the Consent Order are described in &#8220;Business- Supervision and Regulation- Consent Order.&#8221; Effective February 28, 2014, the Bank agreed to the issuance of an Amended Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements . Banks are required to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0% to 100%. Under the risk-based standard, capital is classified into two tiers. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders&#8217; equity (excluding the unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities), trust preferred securities subject to certain limitations, and minus certain intangible assets. Tier 2 capital consists of the general allowance for credit losses except for certain limitations. An institution&#8217;s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk-based capital ratio consists of the sum of its Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The regulatory minimum requirements are 4% for Tier 1 and 8% for total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 10.14% and 11.40%, respectively. 

&#160; 

Banks are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on total assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. The minimum requirement for the leverage ratio is 4%, but all but the highest rated institutions are required to maintain ratios 100 to 200 basis points above the minimum. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s leverage ratio was 7.59%. 

&#160; 

The Consent Order imposes higher capital requirements on OptimumBank. Under the Consent Order, OptimumBank must maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 8.0%, and a total risk based capital ratio of 12.0%. With a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 7.59% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of 11.40% at December 31, 2015, the Bank did not meet the total risk-based capital ratio as required by the Consent Order. 

&#160; 

The FDIC Improvement Act of 1993 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) contains &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions pursuant to which banks are to be classified into one of five categories based upon capital adequacy, ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; and which require (subject to certain exceptions) the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The FDIC has issued regulations to implement the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions of FDICIA. In general, the regulations define the five capital categories as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; an institution is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, has a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to any written capital order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures; 

&#160; 

&#183; an institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and has a leverage ratio of 4% or greater; 

&#160; 

&#183; an institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4% or has a leverage ratio that is less than 4%; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; an institution is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3%; and 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; an institution is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if its &#8220;tangible equity&#8221; is equal to or less than 2% of its total assets. 

&#160; 

The FDIC, after an opportunity for a hearing, has authority to downgrade an institution from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or to subject an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower category, for supervisory concerns. 

&#160; 

Generally, FDICIA requires that an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency within 45 days after the institution becomes &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; and the agency must take action on the plan within 60 days. The appropriate federal banking agency may not accept a capital restoration plan unless, among other requirements, each company having control of the institution has guaranteed that the institution will comply with the plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of the three consecutive calendar quarters and has provided adequate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability under this provision of all companies having control of an institution is limited to the lesser of: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets at the time the institution becomes &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;; or 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the amount which is necessary, or would have been necessary, to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable to the institution as of the time the institution fails to comply with the plan filed pursuant to FDICIA. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

An &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution may not acquire an interest in any company or any other insured depository institution, establish or acquire additional branch offices or engage in any new business unless the appropriate federal banking agency has accepted its capital restoration plan, the institution is implementing the plan, and the agency determines that the proposed action is consistent with and will further the achievement of the plan, or the appropriate Federal banking agency determines the proposed action will further the purpose of the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; sections of FDICIA. 

&#160; 

If an institution is &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; it must comply with the restrictions described above. In addition, the appropriate Federal banking agency is authorized to restrict the activities of any &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institution and to prohibit such an institution, without the appropriate Federal banking agency&#8217;s prior written approval, from: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; engaging in any covered transaction with affiliates (as defined in Section 23A(b) of the Federal Reserve Act); 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; paying excessive compensation or bonuses; and 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution&#8217;s weighted average costs of funds to a level significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the institution&#8217;s normal market areas. 

&#160; 

The &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions of FDICIA also provide that in general no institution may make a capital distribution if it would cause the institution to become &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; Capital distributions include cash (but not stock) dividends, stock purchases, redemptions, and other distributions of capital to the owners of an institution. 

&#160; 

Additionally, FDICIA requires, among other things, that: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; only a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval, and 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the appropriate federal banking agency annually examines all insured depository institutions, with some exceptions for small, &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions and state-chartered institutions examined by state regulators. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, OptimumBank met the FDIC definition of an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution. 

&#160; 

For additional information regarding OptimumBank&#8217;s capital ratios and requirements, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Regulatory Capital Adequacy.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Dividends . The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is substantially dependent on the ability of OptimumBank to pay dividends to the Company. As a state chartered bank, OptimumBank is subject to dividend restrictions set by Florida law and the FDIC. Except with the prior approval of the Florida OFR, all dividends of any Florida bank must be paid out of retained net profits from the current period and the previous two years, after deducting expenses, including losses and bad debts. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or while it is undercapitalized. The FDIC and the Florida OFR also have the general authority to limit the dividend payment by banks if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. The Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is further restricted under the Consent Order and the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is also restricted under its Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve. At December 31, 2015, the Bank and Company could not pay cash dividends. 

&#160; 

Loans to One Borrower. Florida law generally allows a state bank such as OptimumBank to extend credit to any one borrower (and certain related entities of such borrower) in an amount up to 25% of its capital accounts, provided that the unsecured portion may not exceed 15% of the capital accounts of the bank. Based upon OptimumBank&#8217;s capital, the maximum loan OptimumBank is currently permitted to make is approximately $2.3 million, provided the unsecured portion does not exceed approximately $1.4 million. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates. Under federal law, federally insured banks are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on any extension of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investment in the stock or other securities of affiliates, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service. 

&#160; 

Change of Bank Control. Florida law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of financial institutions are less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that often result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under Florida law, no person or group of persons may, directly or indirectly or acting by or through one or more persons, purchase or acquire a controlling interest in any bank which would result in the change in control of that bank unless the Florida OFR first shall have approved such proposed acquisition. A person or group will be deemed to have acquired &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank (i) if the person or group, directly or indirectly or acting by or through one, or more other persons, owns, controls, or has power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank, or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the bank, or (ii) if the Florida OFR determines that such person exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank. In any case where a proposed purchase of voting securities would give rise to a presumption of control, the person or group who proposes to purchase the securities must first file written notice of the proposal to the Florida OFR for its review and approval. Subsections 658.27(2) and 658.28(3), Florida Statutes, refer to a potential change of control of a financial institution at a 10% or more threshold and rebuttable presumption of control. Accordingly, the name of any subscriber acquiring more than 10% of the voting securities of OptimumBank must be submitted to the Florida OFR for prior approval. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act . The USA Patriot Act was enacted after September 11, 2001, to provide the federal government with powers to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering, and has resulted in promulgation of several regulations that have a direct impact on banks. There are a number of programs that financial institutions must have in place such as: (i) Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering programs to manage risk; (ii) Customer Identification Programs to determine the true identity of customers, document and verify the information, and determine whether the customer appears on any federal government list of known or suspected terrorist or terrorist organizations; and (iii) monitoring for the timely detection and reporting of suspicious activity and reportable transactions. Over the past few years, enforcement, and compliance monitoring, of these anti-money laundering laws has dramatically increased. As a result, the Bank has increased the attention and resources it dedicates to compliance with these laws. 

&#160; 

Other Consumer Laws. Florida usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank. OptimumBank&#8217;s loans are also subject to federal laws applicable to consumer credit transactions, such as the: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Federal Truth-In-Lending Act governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Community Reinvestment Act requiring financial institutions to meet their obligations to provide for the total credit needs of the communities they serve, including investing their assets in loans to low and moderate-income borrowers; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligations to meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibitive factors in extending credit; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act which requires lenders to disclose certain information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements, and prohibits certain lending practices, as well as limits escrow account amounts in real estate transactions; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Fair Debt Collection Act governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act which establishes additional rights for consumers to obtain and correct credit reports, addresses identity theft, and establishes additional requirements for consumer reporting agencies and financial institutions that provide adverse credit information to a consumer reporting agency; and 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The rules and regulations of various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

&#160; 

OptimumBank&#8217;s deposit and loan operations are also subject to the: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 privacy provisions, which require the Bank maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard consumer financial information, to disclose these policies to its customers, and allow customers to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to, and withdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Regulation 

&#160; 

Enforcement Powers . Congress has provided the federal bank regulatory agencies with an array of powers to enforce laws, rules, regulations and orders. Among other things, the agencies may require that institutions cease and desist from certain activities, may preclude persons from participating in the affairs of insured depository institutions, may suspend or remove deposit insurance, and may impose civil money penalties against institution-affiliated parties for certain violations. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the appropriate bank regulatory agency. Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of the Bank&#8217;s record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any bank which has applied to charter a bank, obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an office, or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying the application. 

&#160; 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve monetary policies have had, and will likely continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States Government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirement against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
