 Item 1. Business 

Fluor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on September 11, 2000 prior to a reverse spin-off transaction involving the company's coal business. However, through our predecessors, we have been in business for over a century. Our principal executive offices are located at 6700 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039, and our telephone number is (469) 398-7000. 

Our common stock currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FLR". 

Fluor Corporation is a holding company that owns the stock of a number of subsidiaries. Acting through these subsidiaries, we are one of the largest professional services firms providing engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, commissioning and maintenance as well as project management services on a global basis. We are an integrated solutions provider for our clients in a diverse set of industries worldwide including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, transportation, mining and metals, power, life sciences and manufacturing. We are also a service provider to the U.S. 

federal government and governments abroad; and we perform operations and maintenance activities globally for major industrial clients. 

Our business is aligned into five principal segments. The five segments are Oil &#38; Gas, Industrial &#38; Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. Fluor Constructors International, Inc., which is organized and operates separately from the rest of our business, provides unionized management and construction services in the United States and Canada, both independently and as a subcontractor on projects in each of our segments. Financial information on our segments, as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, is set forth on page F-46 of this annual report on Form 10-K under the caption "Operating Information by Segment," which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Competitive Strengths 

As an integrated world class solutions provider of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and project management services, we believe that our business model allows us the opportunity to bring to our clients on a global basis capital efficient business offerings that combine excellence in execution, safety, cost containment and experience. In that regard, we believe that our business strategies, which are based on certain of our core competencies, provide us with some significant competitive advantages: 

&#160; Excellence in Execution Given our proven track record of project completion and client satisfaction, we believe that our ability to design, engineer, construct, commission and manage complex projects often in geographically challenging locations gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We strive to complete our projects meeting or exceeding all client specifications. In an increasingly competitive environment, we are also continually emphasizing cost and schedule controls so that we meet our clients' performance requirements as well as their schedule and budgetary needs. 

&#160; Financial Strength We believe that we are among the most financially sound companies in our industry. We strive to maintain a solid financial condition, placing an emphasis on having a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating. Our financial strength provides us a valuable competitive advantage in terms of access to surety bonding capacity and letters of credit which are critical to our business. Our strong balance sheet also allows us to fund our strategic initiatives, pay dividends, repurchase stock, pursue opportunities for growth and better manage unanticipated cash flow variations. 

&#160; Safety One of our core values and a fundamental business strategy is our constant pursuit of safety. The maintenance of a safe and secure workplace is a key business driver for us and our clients. In the areas in which we provide our services, we have delivered and continue to deliver excellent safety performance, with our safety record being better than the industry average. In our experience, whether in an office or at a job-site, a safe environment decreases risks, assures a proper environment for all workers, enhances their morale and improves their productivity, reduces project cost and generally improves client relations. We believe that our safety record is one of our most distinguishing features. 

&#160; Global Execution Platform As the largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and maintenance company, we have a global footprint with employees situated throughout the world. Our global presence allows us to build local relationships that permit us to capitalize on opportunities near these locations. It also allows us to mobilize quickly to project sites around the world. 

&#160; Market Diversity The company serves multiple markets across a broad spectrum of industries across the globe and offers a wide variety of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, commissioning and maintenance services. We feel that our market diversity is a key strength of our company that helps to mitigate the impact of the cyclicality in the markets we serve. Just as important, our concentrated attention on market diversification allows us to achieve more consistent growth and deliver solid returns. We believe that our continued strategy of maintaining a good mixture within our entire business portfolio permits us to both focus on our more stable business markets and to 

capitalize on developing our cyclical markets when the timing is appropriate. This strategy also allows us to better weather any downturns in a specific market by emphasizing markets that are strong. 

&#160; Client Relationships Our culture is based on putting the customer at the center of everything we do. We actively pursue relationships with new clients while at the same time building on our long-term relationships with existing clients. We continue to believe that long-term relationships with existing, sometimes decades-old, clients serves us well by allowing us to better understand and be more responsive to their requirements. Regardless of whether our clients are new or have been with us for many years, our ability to successfully foster relationships is a key driver to the success of our business. 

&#160; Risk Management We believe that our ability to assess, understand, gauge, mitigate and manage project risk, especially in difficult locations or circumstances or in a complicated contracting environment, provides us with a proven ability to deliver the project certainty our clients demand. We have an experienced management team, and utilize a systematic and disciplined approach towards managing risks. We believe that our comprehensive risk management approach allows us to better control costs and schedule, which in turn leads to clients who are satisfied with the delivered product. 

&#160; Integrated Solutions Through our integrated solutions offering, we can deliver to clients our broad range of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, equipment services, maintenance and management services and offerings in an integrated package. This approach spans the entire lifecycle of a project &#151; from initial scoping and front end engineering to construction, fabrication, equipment and supply chain to post-completion operations and maintenance &#151; thereby allowing us to bring our full breadth of resources to better solve client challenges and create opportunities. Our integrated solutions approach allows us to exercise better overall control of a project, in collaboration with our clients, which in turn results in more predictable and profitable results while enhancing the value, safety and efficiencies we can bring to a project. We believe we are one of the few industry players who have the capability to deliver integrated solutions to our client, which we believe is a clear differentiator for us. 

General Operations 

Our services fall into six broad categories: engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and project management. We offer these services independently as well as on a fully integrated basis. Our services can range from basic consulting activities, often at the early stages of a project, to complete design-build and maintenance contracts. 

&#149; In engineering, our expertise ranges from traditional engineering disciplines such as piping, mechanical, electrical, control systems, civil, structural and architectural to advanced engineering specialties including process engineering, chemical engineering, simulation, enterprise integration, integrated automation processes and interactive 3-D modeling. As part of these services, we often provide master planning and conceptual design services, which allow us to align each project's function, scope, cost and schedule with the client's objectives in order to optimize project success. Also included within these services are such activities as feasibility studies, project development planning, technology evaluation, risk management assessment, global siting, constructability reviews, asset optimization and front-end engineering. &#149; Our procurement organization offers traditional procurement services as well as supply chain solutions aimed at improving product quality and performance while also reducing project cost and schedule. Our clients benefit from our global sourcing and supply expertise, global purchasing power, technical knowledge, processes, systems and experienced global resources. Our traditional procurement activities include strategic sourcing, material management, contracts management, buying, expediting, supplier quality inspection and logistics. &#149; In construction, we mobilize, execute, commission and demobilize projects on a self-perform or subcontracted basis. Generally, we are responsible for the completion of a project, often in difficult locations and under challenging circumstances. We are frequently designated as a program manager, where a client has facilities in multiple locations, complex phases in a single project 3 

location, or a large-scale investment in a facility. Depending upon the project, we often serve as the primary contractor or we may act as a subcontractor to another party. 

&#149; We also provide a variety of fabrication and modularization services, including integrated engineering and modular fabrication and assembly, modular construction and asset support services. We offer a range of options designed to meet the specific needs of our clients. By operating self-perform fabrication yards in key regions of the world, our off-site fabrication solutions help our clients achieve cost and schedule savings by reducing on-site craft needs and shifting work to inherently safer and more controlled work environments. &#149; Under our operations and maintenance contracts, our clients ask us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities for them. We do so through the delivery of total maintenance services, facility management, plant readiness, commissioning, start-up and maintenance technology, small capital projects, turnaround and outage services, all on a global basis. Among other things, we can provide key management, staffing and management skills to clients on-site at their facilities. Our operations and maintenance activities also include routine and outage/turnaround maintenance services, general maintenance and asset management, emissions reduction technologies and services, and restorative, repair, predictive and prevention services. In December 2015, we announced the acquisition of Stork Holding B.V, a global provider of maintenance, modification and asset integrity services. Through this acquisition, we will significantly increase our operations and maintenance business while also enhancing our integrated solutions capabilities. This transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2016. &#149; Project management, the primary responsibility of managing all aspects of the effort to deliver projects on schedule and within budget, is required on every project. We are often hired as the overall program manager on large complex projects where various contractors and subcontractors are involved and multiple activities need to be integrated to ensure the success of the overall project. Project management services include logistics, development of project execution plans, detailed schedules, cost forecasts, progress tracking and reporting, and the integration of the engineering, procurement and construction efforts. Project management is accountable to the client to deliver the safety, functionality and financial performance requirements of the project. We operate in five principal business segments, as described below. 

Oil &#38; Gas 

Through our Oil &#38; Gas segment, we have long served the global oil and gas production, processing, and chemical and petrochemical industries, as an integrated solutions provider offering a full range of design, engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and project management services to a broad spectrum of energy-related industries. We serve a number of specific industries including chemicals and petrochemicals, downstream refining, pipelines, upstream oil and gas production, liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and offshore production. While we perform projects that range greatly in size and scope, we believe that one of our distinguishing features is that we are one of the few companies that have the global strength and experience to perform extremely large projects in difficult locations. As the locations of large scale oil, gas and chemicals projects have become more challenging geographically, geopolitically or otherwise, we believe that clients will continue to look to us based upon our size, strength, global reach, experience and track-record to manage their complex projects. 

As the global economy becomes increasingly competitive, clients are placing more emphasis on capital efficient project execution. Also, in many of the countries where we work, clients are requiring more local content in their projects by mandating use of in-country talent and procurement of in-country goods and services. To meet these challenges, we continue to expand our footprint in growth regions by establishing local offices, forming strategic alliances with local partners, and emphasizing local training programs. We are also increasing our use of distributed execution centers such as our offices in Manila, Cebu and New Delhi where we can continue to provide superior services on a very cost-efficient basis. 

With each specific project, our role can vary. We may be involved in providing front-end engineering, program management and final design services, construction management services, self-perform construction, or oversight of other contractors and we may also assume responsibility for the procurement of materials, equipment and subcontractors. We have the capacity to design and construct new facilities, upgrade, revamp and expand existing facilities, and rebuild facilities following fires and explosions. We also provide consulting services ranging from feasibility studies to process assessment to project finance structuring and studies. 

In the upstream sector, our clients need to develop additional and new sources of supply. Our typical projects in the upstream sector revolve around the production, processing and transporting of oil and gas resources, including the development of infrastructure associated with major new fields and pipelines, as well as LNG projects. We are also involved in offshore production facilities and in conventional and unconventional gas projects in various geographical locations. 

In the downstream sector, we continue to pursue significant global opportunities relating to refined products. Our clients are modernizing and modifying existing refineries to increase capacity and satisfy environmental requirements. We continue to play a strong role in each of these markets. We also remain focused on markets, such as clean fuels, where an increasing number of countries are implementing stronger environmental standards. 

In the chemicals and petrochemicals market, we have been very active for several years with major projects involving the expansion of ethylene based derivatives. The most active markets have been in the United States, Middle East and Asia, where there is significant demand for chemical products. 

With our partner Grupo ICA, we maintain a joint venture known as ICA Fluor, through which we continue to participate in the Mexican and Central American oil, gas, power, chemical and other markets. 

We are also focused on meeting the fabrication and modularization needs of our clients through a range of on-site and off-site options. We provide self-perform fabrication, integrated modular engineering fabrication and assembly, modular construction and asset support services to customers around the globe from our joint venture yards in Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Canada. In 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to create an entity known as COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("CFHI"), which will provide us with the ability to produce cost effective and very large fabrication solutions to both the on-shore and off-shore markets, in a world-class, state-of-art facility located near Zhuhai, China. Through our procurement services, we also provide clients access to many independent fabrication facilities throughout the world. 

Industrial &#38; Infrastructure 

The Industrial &#38; Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction, operations and maintenance and project management services to the transportation, commercial and institutional, manufacturing, life sciences, mining and metals, telecommunications, microelectronics and water sectors. These projects often require application of our clients' state-of-the-art processes and intellectual knowledge. We focus on providing our clients with capital efficiencies through solutions that seek to reduce costs and compress delivery schedules. By doing so, we are able to complete our clients' projects on a quick and more cost efficient basis. In addition, we also work closely with clients in these and other sectors, including clients in the oil and gas and chemicals industries, by providing operations and maintenance services to help them achieve operational improvements at new or existing facilities thereby allowing our clients to remain focused on their core business functions. 

In transportation, we focus on infrastructure projects, such as roads, highways, bridges and rail, with particular interest in large, complex projects. We provide a broad range of services including consulting, design, planning, financial structuring, engineering and construction, domestically and internationally. Our projects may involve the use of public/private partnerships, which allow us to develop and finance deals in concert with public entities for projects such as toll roads and rail lines that would not have otherwise been undertaken, had only public funding been available. And, from time to time, we may also be an equity 

investor in such public/private partnership projects. As the global population continues to grow (especially in emerging countries) and existing infrastructure continues to age (especially in developed countries), we have won and will continue to pursue transportation projects on a global basis. 

In manufacturing, we provide design, engineering, procurement, consulting, construction and construction management services to a wide variety of industries. 

In life sciences, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We also specialize in providing validation and commissioning services where we not only bring new facilities into production but we also keep existing facilities operating. The ability to complete projects on a large scale basis, especially in a business where time to market is critical, allows us to better serve our clients and is a key competitive advantage. 

In mining and metals, we provide a full range of services to the iron ore, copper, diamond, gold, nickel, alumina, aluminum and other commodity-based industries. These services include feasibility studies through detailed engineering, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning and start-up support. We see many of these opportunities being developed in extreme altitudes, topographies and climates, such as the Andes Mountains, Mongolia, Western Australia and Africa. We are one of the few companies with the size and experience to execute large scale mining and metals projects in these difficult locations. 

Activities in the operations and maintenance markets include providing facility start-up and management, plant and facility maintenance, operations support and asset management services to the oil and gas, chemicals, life sciences, mining and metals, consumer products and manufacturing industries. We are a leading supplier of operations and maintenance services, providing our service offerings both domestically and internationally. This business often benefits from large projects that originate in another of our segments which can lead to long-term maintenance or operations opportunities. Conversely, our long-term maintenance contracts can lead to larger capital projects for our other business segments when that need arises. 

Government 

Our Government segment is a provider of engineering, construction, logistics, base and facilities operations and maintenance, contingency response and environmental and nuclear services to the U.S. government and governments abroad. Because the U.S. and other governments are the largest purchasers of outsourced services in the world, government work represents an attractive opportunity for the company. 

For the energy sector, we provide site management, environmental remediation, decommissioning, engineering and construction services and have been very successful in addressing the myriad environmental and regulatory challenges associated with these sites. Fluor performs significant activities as part of a joint venture that has responsibility for the Savannah River site near Aiken, South Carolina. Fluor-led teams are also responsible for certain decommissioning activities for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), including the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Pike County, Ohio (Portsmouth) and Paducah, Kentucky. Additionally, a Fluor-led team is providing operations and maintenance services with the Department of Energy at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in New Orleans, Louisiana. We are also serving government customers outside of the United States. For example, Fluor is part of a joint venture that is providing nuclear decommissioning services at 12 sites under the Magnox/Research Site Restoration Limited contract for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the United Kingdom and site and lab management services for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited at Chalk River, which is Canada's largest research and development complex for science and technology. 

The Government segment also provides engineering and construction services, logistics and life-support, as well as contingency operations support, to the defense sector. We support military logistical and infrastructure needs around the world. Specifically, we provide life-support, engineering, procurement, construction and logistical augmentation services to the U.S. military and coalition forces in various 

international locations, with a primary focus on the United States military-related activities in and around the Middle East and more specifically in Afghanistan and Africa. Because of our strong network of global resources, we believe we are well-situated to efficiently and effectively mobilize the resources necessary for defense operations, even in the most remote and difficult locations to both traditional and U.S. government classified customers around the world. 

In combination with our subsidiary, Fluor Federal Solutions, we are a leading provider of outsourced services to the U.S. government. We provide operations and maintenance services at military bases and education and training services to the Department of Labor, particularly through Job Corps programs. In addition, we provide construction services to new and existing facilities for the U.S. military, the intelligence community and in support of foreign military sales programs. 

The company is also providing support to the Department of Homeland Security. We are particularly involved in supporting the U.S. government's rapid response capabilities to address security issues and disaster relief, the latter primarily through our long-standing relationship with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

Global Services 

Consistent with our integrated solutions offerings, the Global Services segment represents a combination of other operating segments that provide a wide array of solutions to support projects across Fluor groups all over the world. Capabilities within Global Services include site equipment and tool services, industrial fleet services and staffing services. 

Global Services provides Site Services&#174; and fleet management services through AMECO&#174;. AMECO provides integrated construction equipment, tool, and fleet service solutions to the company and third party clients on a global basis for construction projects and plant sites. AMECO supports large construction projects and plants at locations throughout North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Southeast Asia. 

Global Services serves the staffing market through TRS&#174;. TRS is a global enterprise of staffing specialists that provides the company and third party clients with recruiting and permanent placement services and the placement of contract technical professionals. 

Power 

In the Power segment, we provide a full range of services to the gas fueled, solid fueled, environmental compliance, renewables, nuclear and power services markets. Our services include engineering, procurement, construction, program management, start-up and commissioning, operations and maintenance and technical services. 

Through the gas fueled market, we offer a full range of services for simple and combined cycle reference plant designs, as well as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) projects. In the United States, investment in gas fueled plants is continuing to improve, driven by coal-fired plant retirements and low cost gas. We are also expanding our international operations in this market. 

Through the solid fueled and environmental compliance markets, we offer a full range of services for subcritical, supercritical, ultra-supercritical and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technologies, as well as emissions reduction solutions including selective catalytic reduction (SCR), flue gas desulphurization (FGD), and particulate and mercury controls designs. As part of our environmental compliance service offering, we design, install and commission emissions reduction equipment in order to assist our clients with environmental guideline compliance which allows owners to comply with current emissions regulations. We also offer comprehensive solutions for post-combustion carbon capture and sequestration for solid fueled and gas fueled facilities on a global basis, offering our commercially demonstrated proprietary Econamine FG Plus SM CO 2 capture technology. 

In the renewables market, we offer a wide range of technology choices for solar, biomass and geothermal solutions on a global basis. For solar, we are strongly focused globally on thermal technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) as well as concentrating solar power (CSP) applications. In the biomass market, we bring proven expertise with small boiler and circulating fluidized bed technologies for projects using woody biomass and/or agricultural waste fuels. 

In nuclear, we announced in January 2016 that we had entered into contracting arrangements with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at nuclear power plants located in Georgia and South Carolina (the "WEC Contracts"). With these awards and our 70 years of experience in the nuclear industry, we are strategically positioned to offer our extensive experience for new build plants, capital modifications, extended power uprate (EPU) projects and operations and maintenance services on a global basis. We also continue to invest in NuScale Power, LLC ("NuScale"), an Oregon-based small modular nuclear reactor ("SMR") technology company. NuScale is a leader in the development of light water, passively safe SMRs, which we believe will provide us with significant future opportunities. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy and NuScale entered into a cooperative agreement whereby the government will reimburse certain NuScale research and development efforts through 2019. 

Through our power services business line, we offer a variety of services to owners including fossil, renewable and nuclear plant maintenance, facility management, operations support, asset performance improvement, capital modifications and improvements, operations readiness and start-up commissioning on a global basis. We have annual maintenance and modification contracts covering full generation fleets within the utility generation market. 

Additionally, we provide a solution to the transmission and distribution market in the United States and South Africa. In the U.S. market, the scope of services is focused on the design and construction of new transmission lines to connect new capacity from the renewable energy facilities to existing distribution centers. 

Other Matters 

Backlog 

Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The following table sets forth the consolidated backlog of the company's segments at December 31, 2015 and 2014: 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; Oil &#38; Gas &#160; $ 28,796 &#160; $ 28,493 &#160; Industrial &#38; Infrastructure &#160; &#160; 5,600 &#160; &#160; 7,194 &#160; Government (1) &#160; &#160; 3,560 &#160; &#160; 4,741 &#160; Global Services &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Power &#160; &#160; 6,770 &#160; &#160; 2,054 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 44,726 &#160; $ 42,482 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total backlog includes $912 million and $2.1 billion, respectively, of unfunded government contracts. 

The following table sets forth our consolidated backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by region: 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; United States &#160; $ 18,167 &#160; $ 14,424 &#160; Asia Pacific (including Australia) &#160; &#160; 2,678 &#160; &#160; 3,153 &#160; Europe, Africa and Middle East &#160; &#160; 13,351 &#160; &#160; 12,211 &#160; The Americas (excluding the United States) &#160; &#160; 10,530 &#160; &#160; 12,694 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 44,726 &#160; $ 42,482 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

For purposes of the preceding tables, backlog for the Industrial &#38; Infrastructure segment includes our operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed. U.S. government agencies operate under annual fiscal appropriations by Congress and fund various federal contracts only on an incremental basis. With respect to backlog in our Government segment, if a contract covers multiple years, we include the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. For our contingency operations, we include only those amounts for which specific task orders have been awarded. For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only our percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog. 

In 2016, we expect to perform approximately 38 percent of our total backlog reported as of December 31, 2015. In comparison, during the last five years we expected to annually perform an average of 54 percent of our total year end backlog in the subsequent fiscal year. The primary reason for the expected decline in the pace of performance of our backlog in 2016 relative to the average expected pace of performance over the past five years is due to client-driven delays in the execution of our contracts. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Due to additional factors outside of our control, such as changes in project schedules, we cannot predict the portion of our December 31, 2015 backlog estimated to be performed annually subsequent to 2016. 

For additional information with respect to our backlog, please see "Item 7. &#151; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," below. 

Types of Contracts 

While the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably, generally we perform our work under two types of contracts: (a) cost reimbursable contracts and (b) fixed-price, lump-sum and guaranteed maximum contracts. In some markets, we are seeing "hybrid" contracts containing both fixed-price and cost reimbursable elements. As of December 31, 2015, the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog: 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; (percentage) &#160; Cost Reimbursable &#160; $ 34,705 &#160; &#160; 78% &#160; Fixed-Price, Lump-Sum and Guaranteed Maximum &#160; $ 10,021 &#160; &#160; 22% &#160; 

Under cost reimbursable contracts, the client reimburses our cost of performing a project and pays us a pre-determined or fixed fee, or a fee based upon a percentage of the cost incurred in completing the project. Our profit may be in the form of a fee, a simple mark-up applied to labor cost incurred in performing the contract, or a combination of the two. The fee element may also vary. The fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors, milestones or targets; it may be a fixed amount in the contract; or it may be based upon a percentage of the cost incurred. 

Our Government segment, primarily acting as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of government programs, generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts subject to applicable statutes and regulations. In many cases, these contracts include incentive fee arrangements. The programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts. Some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") agreements. Under these arrangements, we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend. While the scope is often not initially fully defined or does not require any specific amount of work, once the project scope is determined, additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding. 

Fixed-price contracts include both lump-sum contracts and negotiated fixed-price contracts. Under lump-sum contracts, we typically bid against our competitors on a contract based upon specifications provided by the client. This type of contracting presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, or economic and other changes that may occur during the contract period. Under negotiated fixed-price contracts, we are selected as contractor first, and then we negotiate price with the client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently occur in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some of the work before negotiating the total price for the project. Another type of fixed-price contract is a unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every "unit" of work performed. If we perform well under these types of contracts, we can benefit from cost savings; however, if the project does not proceed as originally planned, we generally cannot recover cost overruns except in certain limited situations. 

Guaranteed maximum price contracts are cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. We can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price. Where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price, we may receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client. 

Competition 

We are one of the world's largest providers of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, operations and maintenance services. The markets served by our business are highly competitive and, for the most part, require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies are competing in the markets served by our business, including U.S.-based companies such as Bechtel Group, Inc., CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., KBR, Inc., Kiewit Corporation, Granite Construction, Inc. and AECOM Technology Corporation, and international-based companies such as AMEC Foster Wheeler plc, Balfour Beatty, Chicago Bridge and Iron Company N.V., Chiyoda Corporation, Hyundai Engineering &#38; Construction Company, JGC Corporation, SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., Samsung Engineering, Technip and WorleyParsons Limited. 

In the engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction arena, which is served by our Oil &#38; Gas, Industrial &#38; Infrastructure and Power segments, competition is based on an ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. Our engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity, excellence in execution, reputation for quality, technology, cost-effectiveness, worldwide procurement capability, project management expertise, geographic coverage, ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis, ability to execute projects of varying sizes, strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies. In the operations and maintenance markets, barriers to entry are both financially and logistically low, with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant. Competition in those markets is generally driven by reputation, price and the capacity to perform. 

The various markets served by the Global Services segment, while having some similarities to the construction and procurement arena, tend also to have discrete issues impacting individual units. Each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets. The equipment sector, which operates in numerous markets, is highly fragmented and very competitive, with a large number of competitors mostly operating in specific geographic areas. The competition in the equipment sector for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment, tool and management services. Temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over 1,000 companies competing globally. The key competitive factors in this business line are price, service, quality, breadth of service and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage. 

Key competitive factors in our Government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. 

Significant Clients 

For 2015, revenue earned from agencies of the U.S. government and Exxon Mobil Corporation accounted for 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. We perform work for these clients under multiple contracts and sometimes through joint venture arrangements. 

Raw Materials 

The principal products we use in our business include structural steel, metal plate, concrete, cable and various electrical and mechanical components. These products and components are subject to raw material (aluminum, copper, nickel, iron ore, etc.) availability and commodity pricing fluctuations, which we monitor on a regular basis. We have access to numerous global supply sources and we do not foresee any unavailability of these items that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term. However, the availability of these products, components and raw materials may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including client demand, producer capacity, market conditions and specific material shortages. 

Research and Development 

Aside from our investment in NuScale, we generally do not engage in significant research and development efforts for new products and services and, during the past three fiscal years, we have not incurred cost for company-sponsored or client-sponsored research and development activities which would be material, special or unusual in any of our business segments. See "Item 7. &#151; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Power" for further discussion of the operations of NuScale. 

Patents 

We hold patents and licenses for certain items that we use in our operations, including those held by NuScale. However, none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business. 

Environmental, Safety and Health Matters 

In our business, we engage in the design, engineering, construction, construction management, fabrication and operations and maintenance at sites throughout the world. Work at some of these sites involves activities related to nuclear facilities, hazardous waste, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport, the military and infrastructure. Some of our work can be performed adjacent to environmentally sensitive locations such as wetlands, lakes and rivers. We also contract with the U.S. federal government to remediate hazardous materials, including chemical agents and weapons, as well as to decontaminate and decommission nuclear sites. These activities can require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic, radioactive or hazardous substances. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may 

arise under environmental health and safety laws and regulations, and many of these laws call for joint and several and/or strict liability, which can render a party liable without regard to negligence or fault of such person. 

We believe, based upon present information available to us, that we are generally compliant with all such environmental health and safety laws and regulations. We further believe that our accruals with respect to future environmental cost are adequate and any future cost will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or competitive position. Some factors, however, could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures. These include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations, new developments or changes regarding site cleanup cost or the allocation of such cost among potentially responsible parties, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified.
