 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160; 

As used in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; "Zoom&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; mean Zoom Telephonics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary MTRLC LLC. 

&#160; 

Zoom Telephonics designs, produces, markets, sells, and supports Internet access and other communications-related products including cable modems, cable modem / routers, mobile broadband modems, Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (&#8220;ADSL&#8221; or commonly &#8220;DSL&#8221;) modems, and dial-up modems. Our primary objective is to build upon our position as a leading producer of Internet access devices sold through sales channels that include many of the largest United States (&#8220;USA&#8221; or &#8220;US&#8221;) high-volume electronics retailers, and to take advantage of a number of trends in communications including higher data rates, increasing use of wireless technology for transmission of data, and increasing use of smartphones, tablets, and streaming media. 

&#160; 

Broadband modems, especially cable modems, were Zoom&#8217;s highest revenue product category in both 2015 and 2014. In response to demand for faster connection speeds and increased modem functionality, we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our broadband modem product line. 

Cable modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a cable that connects to the cable service provider&#8217;s managed broadband network. We began shipping cable modems in 2000. Our primary means of distribution to end-users in the US, our primary market, is through national retailers and distributors. We have been selling cable modem products under the Zoom brand, and beginning in 2016 we have started offering cable modem products under the Motorola brand in the US and Canada. 

&#160; 

Our mobile broadband products provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through access to a mobile service provider&#8217;s mobile broadband network. Zoom&#8217;s product line includes mobile broadband modems, mobile broadband routers, and mobile broadband modem/router combinations. 

Our DSL modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a telephone line that typically connects to compatible DSL equipment that is typically managed by the DSL service provider. In past years Zoom has shipped a broad line of DSL modems. Zoom&#8217;s primary DSL product today includes a DSL modem and a 802.11n (&#8220;wireless-N&#8221;) router. 

Our dial-up modems connect personal computers and other devices to the local telephone line for transmission of data, fax, voice, and other information. Our dial-up modems enable personal computers and other devices to connect to other computers and networks, including the Internet, at top data speeds up to 56,000 bits per second. Zoom&#8217;s sales of dial-up modems, our largest source of revenues from the mid-eighties through 2010, are expected to continue their decline due to the ongoing adoption of broadband access. Dial-up modems accounted for only 10.7% of Zoom&#8217;s sales in 2015 compared to 13.0% of Zoom&#8217;s sales in 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Zoom&#8217;s product line also includes wireless products, including WiFi &#174; -compatible wireless-N broadband gateways. These products typically provide wireless communication between devices that are within a quarter mile or less of each other, depending on the specific product. 

&#160; 

We are incorporated in Delaware under the name Zoom Telephonics, Inc. Zoom Telephonics, Inc. was originally incorporated in New York in 1977 and changed its state of incorporation to Delaware in 1993. MTRLC LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zoom Telephonics, Inc., is a limited liability company organized in Delaware that focuses on the sale of our Motorola brand products. Our principal executive offices are located at 207 South Street, Boston, MA 02111, and our telephone number is (617) 423-1072. Our Web site is at www.zoomtel.com . Our common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter market (&#8220;OTCQB&#8221;) under the symbol ZMTP. 

&#160; Available Information 

&#160;

Our Internet website address is www.zoomtel.com. Through our website we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. These SEC reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of our website and at the SEC&#8217;s web site. 

&#160;

Products 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The vast majority of our products facilitate communication of data through the Internet. Our cable modems use the cable-TV cable and our DSL modems use the local telephone line to provide a high-speed link to the Internet. Our mobile broadband modems and our coming mobile broadband routers and sensors connect to the Internet through a mobile service provider&#8217;s mobile broadband network. Our dial-up modems link computers, point-of-purchase terminals, or other devices to each other or the Internet through the traditional telephone network. Our router products may communicate with a broadband modem for access to the Internet, and they may also be used for local area network communications. Our new Connected Home products will connect wireless sensors and controls to users through the Internet. 

&#160; 

Cable Modems 

&#160; 

We have obtained CableLabs&#174; certification for our currently marketed cable modems, and these cable modems have also received a number of cable service provider certifications . The lengthy, expensive, and technically challenging certification process has been, and continues to be, a significant barrier to entry. 

&#160; 

Zoom sells cable modems to end-users through retailers and cable service providers. While sales through the retail channel have been significant, they have been handicapped by the fact that all cable service providers offer cable modems directly with their service. Our view is that cable service providers are required to separately state the non-subsidized rental fees of carrier-provided modems and to eliminate this fee if the consumer chooses to provide the modem. Some cable service providers have not complied with these requirements, thereby hindering consumer choice and the retail modem market. Nevertheless, Zoom has significant cable modem sales through retailers, often to end-users who want to eliminate a monthly cable modem rental charge from their cable service provider. 

&#160; 

During 2015 Zoom&#8217;s cable modem revenues were primarily from four types of cable modems, all supporting Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (&#8220;DOCSIS&#8221;) 3.0 with either 16 or 8 downstream channels and 4 upstream channels (&#8220;16x4&#8221; or &#8220;8x4&#8221;). One product was an 8x4 cable modem bridge, one was a 16x4 cable modem bridge, one was an 8x4 cable modem gateway that included an N300 wireless-N router, and one was n 8x4 cable modem gateway that included an 802.11ac (&#8220;wireless-AC&#8221;) AC1900 router. Zoom continues to develop cable modem products as technology within the cable service provider becomes updated for new generations of advanced products. 

In May 2015 Zoom entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola trademarks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Motorola&#8221;) for cable modem products. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020 we are authorized to manufacture, sell and market consumer cable modem products through certain authorized sales channels using the Motorola trademarks. The agreement includes numerous requirements intended to assure the quality and reputation of Motorola brand products. In January 2016 Zoom, through its MTRLC LLC subsidiary, began shipping cable modems under the Motorola brand. Zoom will also continue to ship Zoom brand cable modems, but these will be distinctly different from our Motorola brand cable modem products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

DSL Modems 

&#160; 

Our DSL modems incorporate the ADSL standards that are currently most popular worldwide, including ADSL2/2+, G.dmt, G.Lite, and ANSI T1.413 issue 2. Zoom currently sells one type of ADSL modem, which has an integrated wireless-N 4-port router using Broadcom Integrated Circuit (&#8220;IC&#8221;) technology. 

&#160; 

Mobile Broadband Modems and Routers 

&#160; 

During the second half of 2009 Zoom began shipping its first mobile broadband or &#8220;cellular&#8221; products, mobile broadband modems and wireless-N routers. Zoom&#8217;s mobile broadband modems currently support AT&#38;T, T-Mobile, and the majority of cellular service providers worldwide who use the Global System for Mobile Communications (&#8220;GSM&#8221;) standard for voice and data. Zoom&#8217;s mobile broadband wireless-N desk and travel routers allow someone to plug in a mobile broadband GSM phone for Internet access, and to share that Internet access with computers, phones, and other devices with wireless-G or wireless-N capability. In late 2010 Zoom expanded its mobile broadband line to include a modem with a top download speed of 14.4 Mbps, and to include the We3G portable modem/router. In 2012 Zoom began shipping a mobile broadband modem/router that includes a voice port into which someone can plug a telephone to make and receive voice calls. Zoom&#8217;s sales of mobile broadband modems and routers are currently small, but Zoom plans to ship new mobile broadband modems, routers, and multi-sensor products that could significantly increase Zoom&#8217;s mobile broadband product sales. Zoom recently received AT&#38;T certification for four cellular modems, and Zoom plans to focus on mobile broadband products that will typically be certified by AT&#38;T, Verizon and other cellular service providers. 

Dial-Up Modems 

&#160; 

We have a broad line of dial-up modems with top data speeds up to 56,000 bps, available in external and internal models. Many of our external modems are designed to work with almost any terminal, computer, or operating system including Windows, Apple, Linux, and others. Personal Computer (&#8220;PC&#8221;) oriented internal modems are designed primarily for installation into the Peripheral Component Interconnect (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) slot, PCI-E slot, or PC card slot of IBM PC-compatibles. Embedded internal modems are designed to be embedded in PCs dedicated for a specific application, such as point-of-purchase terminals, kiosks, and set-top boxes. We sell and market dial-up modems under the Zoom&#174; and Hayes&#174; brands, as well as selling unbranded or private labeled modems for some specific high-volume accounts. 

&#160; 

Wireless Local Area Networking 

&#160; 

In 2005 Zoom began shipping DSL modems with the 802.11g (&#8220;wireless-G&#8221;) standard. Starting in 2009, Zoom began shipping products that incorporate the extended range and higher data rate associated with the wireless-N and then later the wireless-AC wireless standards. These products include wireless adapters and routers, as well as wireless routers integrated with a cable modems or DSL modems as discussed above. Two of the wireless-N routers work with certain mobile broadband Universal Serial Bus (&#8220;USB&#8221;) modems and smartphones, and a third wireless-N router includes a mobile broadband modem. Our line also includes a mobile broadband modem/router combination with a voice port. 

Wireless Connected Home Products 

&#8220;Connected Home&#8221; products typically allow monitoring and/or control of sensors and actuators in the home through a smartphone or some other Internet-connected device. Zoom has developed significant technology in this area, but does not currently ship this type of product in volume. Zoom remains committed to this area, and hopes to ship one or more Connected Home products in 2016. Zoom believes that there is significant potential and market momentum for this type of product, but that there will be significant competition and risk. 

&#160; Products for Markets outside North America 

&#160; 

Products for countries outside the US often differ from a similar product for the US due to different regulatory and certification requirements, country-specific phone jacks and AC power adapters, and language-related specifics. As a result, the introduction of new products into markets outside North America can be costly and time-consuming. In 1993 we introduced our first dial-up modem approved for selected Western European countries. Since then we have continued to expand our product offerings into markets outside North America. We have received regulatory certifications for, and are currently selling our products in a number of countries, including the US, the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;), Spain, Canada, Vietnam, and some Latin American countries. We intend to continue to expand and enhance our product line for our existing markets and to seek certifications for the sale of new products outside the US. However, the vast majority of our sales were in North America in 2015 and we expect that trend to continue in the near term. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales Channels 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We sell our products primarily through high-volume retailers and distributors, Internet service providers, service providers, value-added resellers, PC system integrators, and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"). We support our major accounts in their efforts to discern strategic directions in the market, to maintain appropriate inventory levels, and to offer a balanced selection of attractive products. 

&#160; 

Relatively few customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s revenues. In 2015 three customers accounted for 77% of the Company&#8217;s total net sales with our largest customer accounting for 46% of our net sales. At December 31, 2015, three customers accounted for 93% of our gross accounts receivable, with our largest customer representing 67% of our gross &#160; accounts receivable. In 2014 three customers accounted for 74% of our total net sales, with our largest customer accounting for 53% of our net sales. At December 31, 2014, three customers accounted for 92% of our gross accounts receivable, with our largest customer representing 64% of our gross accounts receivable. 

Distributors and Retailers outside North America 

&#160; 

In markets outside North America we sell and ship our products primarily to distributors. We believe that sales growth outside North America will continue to require substantial additional investments of resources for product design and testing, regulatory certifications, native-language instruction manuals and software, packaging, sales support, and technical support. We have made this investment in the past for many countries, and we expect to make this investment for some countries and products in the future. However, we anticipate that the vast majority of our sales in 2016 will come from the US, largely because the US has an unusually robust retail cable modem market. 

&#160; 

North American High-volume Retailers and Distributors 

&#160; 

In North America we reach the retail market primarily through high-volume retailers. Our North American retailers include Best Buy, Micro Center, Staples, Wal-Mart, and many others including Amazon and other Web-focused retailers. 

We sell significant quantities of our products through distributors, who often sell to corporate accounts, retailers, service providers, value-added resellers, equipment manufacturers, and other customers. Our North American distributors include customers D&#38;H Distributing, Ingram Micro, and Tech Data. 

&#160; 

Internet and Telephone Service Providers 

&#160; 

In past years our sales have included DSL modems sold to DSL service providers in the US and in some other countries. We plan to continue selling and supporting these customers. In addition, we will continue to offer some of our cable modem and mobile broadband products to service providers. 

&#160; 

System Integrators and Original Equipment Manufacturers 

&#160; 

Our system integrator and OEM customers sell our products under their own name or incorporate our products as a component of their systems. We seek to be responsive to the needs of these customers by providing on-time delivery of high-quality, reliable, cost-effective products with strong engineering and sales support. We believe that some of these customers also appreciate the improvement in their products' image due to use of a Zoom or Hayes brand modem. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing &#38; Support 

&#160; 

Our sales, marketing, and support are primarily managed from our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. In North America we sell our Zoom, Motorola, Hayes, and private-label dial-up modem products through Zoom's sales force and through commissioned independent sales representatives managed and supported by our own staff. Most service providers are serviced by Zoom's sales force. Worldwide technical support is primarily handled from our Boston headquarters. 

&#160; 

We believe that Zoom, Motorola, Hayes, and Global Village are widely recognized brand names. We build upon our brand equity in a variety of ways, including cooperative advertising, product packaging, Web advertising, trade shows, and public relations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We attempt to develop quality products that are user-friendly and require minimal support. We typically support our claims of quality with product warranties of one to two years, depending upon the product. To address the needs of end-users and resellers who require assistance, we have our own staff of technical support specialists. They provide telephone support five days per week in English and Spanish. Our technical support specialists also maintain a significant Internet support facility that includes email, firmware and software downloads, and the SmartFacts&#8482; Q&#38;A search engine. 

&#160;

Research &#38; Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products, enhancing the capabilities of existing products, and reducing production costs. We have developed close collaborative relationships with certain of our Original Design Manufacturer (&#8220;ODM&#8221;) suppliers and component suppliers. We work with these partners and other sources to identify and respond to emerging technologies and market trends by developing products that address these trends. In addition, we purchase modems and other chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology from third parties, thereby eliminating the need for us to develop this technology in-house. We do however develop products in-house, including some modems and our Connected Home product line. 

The Company&#8217;s costs on research and development were $1.3 million for 2015 and $1.1 million for 2014. As of December 31, 2015 we had 9 employees engaged primarily in research and development. Our research and development team performs electronics hardware design and layout, mechanical design, prototype construction and testing, component specification, firmware and software development, product testing, foreign and domestic regulatory certification efforts, end-user and internal documentation, and third-party software selection and testing. 

&#160;

Manufacturing &#38; Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our products are currently designed for high-volume automated assembly to help assure reduced costs, rapid market entry, short lead times, and reliability. High-volume assembly typically occurs in China or Taiwan. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers typically obtain some or all of the material required to assemble the products based upon a Zoom Telephonics Approved Vendor List and Parts List. Our manufacturers typically insert parts onto the printed circuit board, with most parts automatically inserted by machine, solder the circuit board, and test the completed assemblies. The contract manufacturer sometimes performs final packaging. For the US and many other markets, packaging is often performed at our facilities in North America, allowing us to tailor the packaging and its contents for our customers immediately before shipping. This facility performs warehousing, shipping, quality control, finishing and some software updates from time to time. We also perform circuit design, circuit board layout, and strategic component sourcing at our Boston headquarters. Wherever the product is built, our quality systems are used to help assure that the product meets our specifications. 

&#160; 

Our North American facility is currently located in Tijuana, Mexico. From time to time we experience certain challenges associated with the Tijuana facility, specifically relating to bringing products across the border between the US and Mexico. We believe that this facility assists us in cost-effectively providing rapid response to the needs of our US customers. 

&#160; 

Historically we have used one primary manufacturer for a given design. We sometimes maintain back-up production tooling at a second manufacturer for our highest-volume products. Our manufacturers are normally adequate to meet reasonable and properly planned production needs; but a fire, natural calamity, strike, financial problem, or other significant event at an assembler's facility could adversely affect our shipments and revenues. In 2015, our business was distributed between two primary cable modem suppliers. As of the end of 2015, these two suppliers counted together provided 85% of our purchased inventory. The loss of a key supplier, or a material adverse change in a key supplier&#8217;s business or in our relationship with a key supplier, could materially and adversely harm our business. 

&#160; 

Our products include a large number of parts, most of which are available from multiple sources with varying lead times. However, most of our products include a sole-sourced chipset as the most critical component of the product. The vast majority of our cable and DSL modem chipsets come exclusively from Broadcom. Our dial-up modem chipsets come exclusively from Conexant. Serious problems at Broadcom or Conexant, including long chipset lead-times, would significantly reduce Zoom&#8217;s shipments. 

&#160; 

We have experienced delays in receiving shipments of modem chipsets in the past, and we may experience such delays in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure that a chipset supplier will, in the future, sell chipsets to us in quantities sufficient to meet our needs or that we will purchase the specified dollar amount of products necessary to receive concessions and incentives from a chipset supplier. An interruption in a chipset supplier's ability to deliver chipsets, a failure of our suppliers to produce chipset enhancements or new chipsets on a timely basis and at competitive prices, a material increase in the price of the chipsets, our failure to purchase a specified dollar amount of products or any other adverse change in our relationship with modem component suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are also subject to price fluctuations in our cost of goods. Our costs may increase if component shortages develop, lead-times stretch out, fuel costs rise, or significant delays develop due to labor-related issues. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) and Consumer Electronics Control (&#8220;CEC&#8221;) rules discussed above, which affect component sourcing, product manufacturing, sales, and marketing. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The Internet access and networking industries are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices, continually changing customer demand patterns, rapid technological advances, and emerging industry standards. These characteristics result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features, and continuous improvements in the relative functionality and price of modems and other communications products. Our operating results and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if we are unable to: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

successfully and accurately anticipate customer demand; 

&#9679; 

manage our product transitions, inventory levels, and manufacturing processes efficiently; 

&#9679; 

distribute or introduce our products quickly in response to customer demand and technological advances; 

&#9679; 

differentiate our products from those of our competitors; or 

&#9679; 

otherwise compete successfully in the markets for our products. 

&#160; 

Some of our primary competitors by product group include the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Cable modem competitors: ARRIS, Belkin / Linksys, D-Link, Hon Hai Network Systems (formerly Ambit Microsystems), Netgear, SMC Networks, Technicolor, TP-Link and Ubee Interactive. 

&#9679; 

Dial-up modem competitors: Best Data, Hiro, Lite-On, Trendnet and US Robotics. 

&#9679; 

DSL modem competitors: ARRIS, 3Com, Actiontec, Airties, Asus, Aztech, Best Data, Belkin / Linksys, D-Link, Huawei, Netgear, Sagemcom (formerly Sagem), Siemens (formerly Efficient Networks), Techicolor, TP-Link, Westell, Xavi, and ZyXEL Communications. 

&#9679; 

Mobile broadband competitors: Cradlepoint, D-Link, Huawei, Netgear, Novatel Wireless, Sierra Wireless, and ZTE. 

&#9679; 

Networking competitors: Belkin / Linksys, Buffalo, D-Link, Netgear, TP-Link and Trendnet. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors and potential competitors have more extensive financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. 

&#160; 

The principal competitive factors in our industry include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

product performance, features, reliability and service; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

price; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

brand image; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

product availability and lead times; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

size and stability of operations; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

breadth of product line and shelf space; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

sales and distribution capability; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;&#9679; 

technical support and service; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

product documentation and product warranties; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

relationships with providers of broadband access services; and 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; 

certifications evidencing compliance with various requirements. 

&#160; 

We believe we are able to provide a competitive mix of the above factors for our products, particularly when they are sold through retailers, computer product distributors, small to medium sized Internet service providers, and system integrators. We are less successful in selling directly to large telephone companies and other large providers of broadband access services. 

&#160; 

Cable, DSL, and mobile broadband modems transmit data at significantly faster speeds than dial-up modems. Cable, DSL and mobile broadband, however, typically require a more expensive Internet access service. In addition, the use of DSL and cable modems is currently impeded by a number of technical and infrastructure limitations. We began shipping both cable and DSL modems in the year 2000. We have had some success in selling to smaller phone companies and to Internet service providers, but we have not sold significant quantities to large service providers. 

&#160; 

Successfully penetrating the broadband modem market presents a number of challenges, including: 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The current limited retail market for broadband modems; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The relatively small number of cable, telecommunications and Internet service providers that make up the majority of the market for broadband modems in the US, our largest market; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The significant bargaining power and market dominance of these large volume purchasers; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The time-consuming, expensive and uncertain certification processes of the various cable and DSL service providers; and 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The strong relationships with service providers enjoyed by some incumbent equipment providers, including ARRIS for cable modems and Huawei for DSL and mobile broadband modems. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademarks and copyrights for our firmware (software on a chip), printed circuit board artwork, instructions, packaging, and literature. We also have six active patents that expire between years 2015 and 2029. We cannot assure that any patent application will be granted or that any patent obtained will provide protection or be of commercial benefit to us, or that the validity of a patent will not be challenged. Moreover, we cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop comparable or superior technologies. 

&#160; 

We license certain technologies used in our products, typically rights to bundled software, on a non-exclusive basis. In addition we purchase chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology. We have received, and may receive in the future, infringement claims from third parties relating to our products and technologies. We investigate the validity of these claims and, if we believe the claims have merit, we respond through licensing or other appropriate actions. Certain of these past claims have related to technology included in modem chipsets. We forwarded these claims to the appropriate vendor. If we or our component manufacturers were unable to license necessary technology on a cost-effective basis, we could be prohibited from marketing products containing that technology, incur substantial costs in redesigning products incorporating that technology, or incur substantial costs defending any legal action taken against it. Where possible we attempt to receive patent indemnification from chipset suppliers and other appropriate suppliers, but the extent of this coverage varies and enforcement of this indemnification may be difficult and costly. 

In May 2015 we entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola brand trademarks for consumer cable modem products in the US and Canada through certain authorized sales channels using such trademarks beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160; 

Our backlog on February 29, 2016 was $0.4 million, and on February 28, 2015 was $0.5 million. Many orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our net sales for any future period. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016, Zoom had 32 full-time and part-time employees. Ten employees were engaged in research and development and quality control. Five employees were involved in operations, which manages production, inventory, purchasing, warehousing, freight, invoicing, shipping, collections, and returns. Ten employees were engaged in sales, marketing, and customer support. The remaining seven employees performed executive, accounting, administrative, and management information systems functions. Zoom currently has 27 full-time employees and 5 employees working less than 5 days per week, typically 4 days per week. Our dedicated personnel in Tijuana, Mexico are employees of our Mexican service provider and not included in our headcount. On February 29, 2016, Zoom had one consultant in sales and one consultant in information systems, neither of whom is included in our headcount.
