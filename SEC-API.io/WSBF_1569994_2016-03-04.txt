Waterstone Financial, Inc.

Waterstone Financial, Inc., a Maryland Corporation, ("New Waterstone") was organized in June 2013. Upon completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Lamplighter Financial, MHC in January 2014, New Waterstone became the holding company of WaterStone Bank SSB ("WaterStone Bank") and succeeded to all of the business and operations of Waterstone Financial, Inc., a Federal Corporation ("Waterstone-Federal") and each of Waterstone-Federal and Lamplighter Financial, MHC ceased to exist. In this report, we refer to WaterStone Bank, our wholly owned subsidiary, both before and after the reorganization, as "WaterStone Bank" or the "Bank."

New Waterstone did not engage in any business prior to the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Lamplighter Financial, MHC on January 22, 2014.

WaterStone Bank's executive offices are located at 11200 West Plank Court, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin 53226, and its telephone number is (414) 761-1000. Its website address is www.wsbonline.com .

WaterStone Bank's mortgage banking operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation originates single-family residential real estate loans for sale into the secondary market. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation utilizes lines of credit provided by WaterStone Bank as a primary source of funds, and also utilizes a line of credit with another financial institution as needed. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation originated approximately $2.0 billion in mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Market Area

WaterStone Bank. WaterStone Bank's market area is broadly defined as the Milwaukee, Wisconsin metropolitan market, which is geographically located in the southeast corner of the state. WaterStone Bank's primary market area is Milwaukee and Waukesha counties and the five surrounding counties of Ozaukee, Washington, Jefferson, Walworth and Racine. We have six branch offices in Milwaukee County, four branch offices in Waukesha County and one branch office in Washington County. At June 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information was publicly available), 49.8% of deposits in the State of Wisconsin were located in the seven-county metropolitan Milwaukee market and 44.0% of deposits in the State of Wisconsin were located in the three counties in which the Bank has a branch office.

WaterStone Bank's primary market area for deposits includes the communities in which we maintain our banking office locations. Our primary lending market area is broader than our primary deposit market area and includes all of the primary market area noted above but extends further west to the Madison, Wisconsin market and further north to the Appleton and Green Bay, Wisconsin markets. In addition, in October 2013 we opened a loan production office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a primary lending market area of the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan market.

Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. As of December 31, 2015, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation had 15 offices in Wisconsin, 13 offices in Florida, eight offices in Pennsylvania, eight offices in Minnesota, four offices in Indiana, two offices in each of Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, and Ohio, and one office in each of Georgia, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

Competition

WaterStone Bank . WaterStone Bank faces competition within our market area both in making real estate loans and attracting deposits. The Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis metropolitan statistical area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large commercial banks, community banks and credit unions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that our market area is a "high-rate" area with regard to deposit pricing as compared to the rest of the United States. As of June 30, 2015, based on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's annual Summary of Deposits Report, we had the eighth largest market share in our metropolitan statistical area out of 52 financial institutions in our metropolitan statistical area, representing 1.4% of all deposits.

Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, and mutual funds. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as trust services and private banking.

Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable consumer and commercial customer relationships while maintaining our role as a community bank.

Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation faces competition for originating loans both directly within the markets in which it operates and from entities that provide services throughout the United States through internet services. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation's competition comes principally from other mortgage banking firms, as well as from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.

One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans. &#160; One- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $382.0 million, or 34.3% of total loans at December 31, 2015. One- to four-family residential mortgage loans originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $41.8 million, or 17.1% of all loans originated for investment. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans have fixed or adjustable rates. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally provide for maximum annual rate adjustments of 200 basis points, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 600 basis points. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans typically amortize over terms of up to 30 years, and are indexed to the 12-month LIBOR rate. We do not and have never offered residential mortgage loans specifically designed for borrowers with sub-prime credit scores, including Alt-A and negative amortization loans. Further, prior to 2007, we did not offer indexed, adjustable-rate loans other than home equity lines of credit, and we have never offered "teaser rate" first mortgage products.

Adjustable rate mortgage loans can decrease the interest rate risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because, as interest rates increase, the loan payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents and, therefore, the effectiveness of adjustable rate mortgage loans in decreasing the risk associated with changes in interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. Moreover, during periods of rapidly declining interest rates the interest income received from the adjustable rate loans can be significantly reduced, thereby adversely affecting interest income.

All residential mortgage loans that we originate include "due-on-sale" clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise transfers the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. We also require homeowner's insurance and where circumstances warrant, flood insurance, on properties securing real estate loans. The average single family first mortgage loan balance was $182,000 and the largest outstanding balance was $2.2 million on December 31, 2015. The average two- to four-family first mortgage loan balance was $153,000 on December 31, 2015, and the largest outstanding balance on that date was $4.8 million, which is a consolidation loan that is collateralized by 29 properties.

Multi-family &#160; Real Estate Loans. Multi-family loans totaled $547.3 million, or 49.1% of total loans at December 31, 2015. Multi-family loans originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $117.7 million, or 48.0% of all loans originated for investment. These loans are generally secured by properties located in our primary market area. Our multi-family real estate underwriting policies generally provide that such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property provided the loan complies with our current loans-to-one borrower limit. Multi-family real estate loans are offered with interest rates that are fixed for periods of up to five years or are variable and either adjust based on a market index or at our discretion. Contractual maturities do not exceed 10 years while principal and interest payments are typically based on a 30-year amortization period. In reaching a decision whether to make a multi-family real estate loan, we consider gross revenues and the net operating income of the property, the borrower's expertise and credit history, business cash flow, and the appraised value of the underlying property. In addition, we will also consider the terms and conditions of the leases and the credit quality of the tenants. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long term debt) of at least 1.15 times. Generally, multi-family loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the principals and by the owners of 20% or more of the borrower. 

&#160;

A multi-family borrower's financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We generally require borrowers with aggregate outstanding balances exceeding $1.0 million to provide updated financial statements and federal tax returns annually. These requirements also apply to all guarantors on these loans. We also require borrowers with rental investment property to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable. The average outstanding multi-family mortgage loan balance was $823,000 on December 31, 2015, with the largest outstanding balance at $9.5 million. At December 31, 2015, our largest exposure to one borrower or to a related group of borrowers was $36.1 million.

&#160;

Loans secured by multi-family real estate generally involve larger principal amounts than owner-occupied, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family properties &#160; often depend on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit . We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2015, outstanding home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled $24.3 million, or 2.2% of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2015, the unadvanced portion of home equity lines of credit totaled $14.2 million. Home equity loans and lines originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $7.3 million, or 3.0% of all loans originated for investment. The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant's credit history, an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Home equity loans are offered with adjustable rates of interest and with terms up to 10 years. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit is generally limited to 90% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. Our home equity lines of credit have ten-year terms and adjustable rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal . Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are generally limited to a maximum rate of 18%. The average outstanding home equity loan balance was $43,000 at December 31, 2015, with the largest outstanding balance at that date of $584,000.

Construction and Land Loans. &#160; We originate construction loans for the acquisition of land and the construction of single-family residences, multi-family residences, and commercial real estate buildings. At December 31, 2015, construction and land loans totaled $19.1 million, or 1.7% of total loans. Construction and land loans originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $11.1 million, or 4.5% of all loans originated for investment. At December 31, 2015, the unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $25.5 million.

Our construction mortgage loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months although our policy is to consider construction periods as long as 12 months or more. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan converts to a longer-term mortgage loan. Construction loans can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90%, provided that the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance if the loan balance exceeds 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or acquisition cost of the secured property. The average outstanding construction loan balance totaled $1.6 million on December 31, 2015, with the largest outstanding balance at $8.3 million. &#160; The average outstanding land loan balance was $186,000 on December 31, 2015, and the largest outstanding balance on that date was $1.2 million. 

&#160;

Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on either the percentage of completion method or the actual cost of the completed work.

Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Additionally, if the estimate of value is inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, with a value that is insufficient to ensure full repayment of the loan.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. &#160; Commercial real estate loans totaled $118.8 million at December 31, 2015, or 10.7% of total loans, and are made up of loans secured by office and retail buildings, industrial buildings, churches, restaurants, other retail properties and mixed use properties. Commercial real estate loans originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $43.1 million, or 17.6% of all loans originated for investment. These loans are generally secured by property located in our primary market area. Our commercial real estate underwriting policies provide that such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial real estate loans are offered with interest rates that are fixed up to five years or are variable and either adjust based on a market index or at our discretion. Contractual maturities do not exceed 10 years while principal and interest payments are typically based on a 30-year amortization period. In reaching a decision whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider gross revenues and the net operating income of the property, the borrower's expertise and credit history, business cash flow, and the appraised value of the underlying property. In addition, we will also consider the terms and conditions of the leases and the credit quality of the tenants. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long term debt) of at least 1.15 times. Environmental surveys are required for commercial real estate loans when environmental risks are identified. Generally, commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the principals and by the owners of 20% or more of the borrower.

A commercial real estate borrower's financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We generally require borrowers with aggregate outstanding balances exceeding $1.0 million to provide annual updated financial statements and federal tax returns. These requirements also apply to all guarantors on these loans. We also require borrowers to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable. The average commercial real estate loan in our portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $664,000, and the largest outstanding balance at that date was $7.5 million.

&#160;

Commercial Loans. &#160; Commercial loans totaled $23.0 million at December 31, 2015, or 2.1% of total loans, and are made up of loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. Commercial loans originated for investment during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $23.5 million, or 9.6% of all loans originated.

Our commercial loans are generally made to borrowers that are located in our primary market area. Working capital lines of credit are granted for the purpose of carrying inventory and accounts receivable or purchasing equipment. These lines require that certain working capital ratios must be maintained and are monitored on a monthly or quarterly basis. Working capital lines of credit are short-term loans of 12 months or less with variable interest rates. At December 31, 2015, the unadvanced portion of working capital lines of credit totaled $16.4 million. Outstanding balances fluctuate up to the maximum commitment amount based on fluctuations in the balance of the underlying collateral. Personal property loans secured by equipment are considered commercial business loans and are generally made for terms of up to 84 months and for up to 80% of the value of the underlying collateral. Interest rates on equipment loans may be either fixed or variable. Commercial business loans are generally variable rate loans with initial fixed rate periods of up to five years.

A commercial business borrower's financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, usually quarterly, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. The average outstanding commercial loan at December 31, 2015 was $200,000 and the largest outstanding balance on that date was $3.4 million.

Origination and Servicing of Loans. &#160; All loans originated for investment are underwritten pursuant to internally developed policies and procedures. While we generally underwrite owner-occupied residential mortgage loans to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards, due to several unique characteristics, our loans originated prior to 2008 do not conform to the secondary market standards. The unique features of these loans include: interest payments in advance of the month in which they are earned, discretionary rate adjustments that are not tied to an independent index.

Exclusive of our mortgage banking operations, we retain in our portfolio all of the loans that we originate. At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank wasn't servicing any loan we originated and subsequently sold to unrelated third parties. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . &#160; WaterStone Bank's lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by WaterStone Bank's board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan, if applicable. To assess the borrower's ability to repay, we review the employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of borrowers.

Loan officers, with concurrence from independent credit officers and underwriters, are authorized to approve and close any loan that qualifies under WaterStone Bank underwriting guidelines within the following lending limits:

&#8226;

A secured one- to four-family mortgage loan up to $500,000 for a borrower with total outstanding loans from us of less than $1,000,000 that is independently underwritten can be approved by select loan officers.

&#160;

&#8226;

A loan up to $500,000 for a borrower with total outstanding loans from us of less than $500,000 can be approved by select commercial loan officers.

&#160;

&#8226;

Any secured mortgage loan ranging from $500,001 to $2,999,999 or any new loan to a borrower with outstanding loans from us exceeding $1,000,000 must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee.

&#160;

&#8226;

Any loan for $3,000,000 or more must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee and the board of directors prior to closing. Any new loan to a borrower with outstanding loans from us exceeding $10,000,000 must be reviewed by the board of directors.

&#160;

Asset Quality

When a loan becomes more than 30 days delinquent, WaterStone Bank sends a letter advising the borrower of the delinquency. The borrower is given a specific date by which delinquent payments must be made or by which they must contact WaterStone Bank to make arrangements to bring the loan current over a longer period of time. If the borrower fails to bring the loan current within the specified time period or to make arrangements to cure the delinquency over a longer period of time, the matter is referred to legal counsel and foreclosure or other collection proceedings are considered.

All loans are reviewed on a regular basis, and such loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 or more days delinquent. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received when collection of the remaining principal balance is reasonably assured.

- 8 -

Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and other real estate owned. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, management may place such loans on non-accrual status immediately, rather than waiting until the loan becomes 90 days past due. At the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and additional income is recorded only to the extent that payments are received and the collection of principal is reasonably assured. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

All loans that meet or exceed 90 days with respect to past due principal and interest are recognized as non-accrual. Troubled debt restructurings which are still on nonaccrual either due to being past due 90 days or greater, or which have not yet performed under the modified terms for a reasonable period of time, are included in the table above. In addition, loans which are past due less than 90 days are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collectability given other credit risk factors such as early stage delinquency, the nature of the collateral or the results of a borrower fiscal review. When the collection of all contractual principal and interest is determined to be unlikely, the loan is moved to non-accrual status and an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral is ordered. This process generally takes place between contractual past due dates 60 and 90 days. Upon determining the updated estimated value of the collateral, a loan loss provision is recorded to establish a specific reserve to the extent that the outstanding principal balance exceeds the updated estimated net realizable value of the collateral. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible, generally coinciding with the initiation of foreclosure action, the specific reserve is reviewed for adequacy, adjusted if necessary, and charged-off.

Total non-accrual loans decreased by $20.4 million, or 53.7%, to $17.6 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $38.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans receivable was 1.58% at December 31, 2015 compared to 3.47% at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, $15.6 million were transferred to real estate owned, $3.8 million in loan principal was charged off, $5.4 million in principal payments were received and $5.8 million in loans were returned to accrual status. Offsetting this activity, $10.2 million in loans were placed on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2015.

- 9 -

Of the $17.6 million in total non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2015, $16.4 million in loans have been specifically reviewed to assess whether a specific valuation allowance is necessary. A specific valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying value of the loan exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral with an adjustment made for costs to dispose of the asset. Based upon these specific reviews, a total of $3.4 million in partial charge-offs have been recorded with respect to these loans as of December 31, 2015. Partially charged-off loans measured for impairment based upon net realizable collateral value are maintained in a "non-performing" status and are disclosed as impaired loans. In addition, specific reserves totaling $1.3 million have been recorded as of December 31, 2015. The remaining $1.2 million of non-accrual loans were reviewed on an aggregate basis and $243,000 in general valuation allowance was deemed necessary related to those loans as of December 31, 2015. The $243,000 in general valuation allowance is based upon a migration analysis performed with respect to similar non-accrual loans in prior periods.

The outstanding principal balance of our five largest non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2015 totaled $4.1 million, which represents 23.1% of total non-accrual loans as of that date. These five loans are carried net of cumulative life-to-date charge-offs of $865,000. Aggregate specific valuation allowances with respect to these five loans total $520,000 as of December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $1.2 million. We received $944,000 of interest payments on such loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest payments received are treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining book value of the loan (i.e., after charge-off of all identified losses) is deemed to be fully collectible. If the remaining book value is not deemed to be fully collectible, all payments received are applied to unpaid principal. Determination as to the ultimate collectability of the remaining book value is supported by an updated credit department evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors.

&#160;

There were no accruing loans past due 90 days or more during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Troubled debt restructurings totaled $17.5 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $26.1 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, $16.5 million of troubled debt restructurings, or 94.2%, were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. All troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired and are risk rated as either substandard or watch and are included in the internal risk rating tables disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Specific reserves have been established to the extent that the collateral-based impairment analyses indicate that a collateral shortfall exists or to the extent that a discounted cash flow analysis results in an impairment.

We do not participate in government-sponsored troubled debt restructuring programs. Our troubled debt restructurings are short-term modifications. Typical initial restructured terms include six to twelve months of principal forbearance, a reduction in interest rate or both. Restructured terms do not include a reduction of the outstanding principal balance unless mandated by a bankruptcy court. Troubled debt restructuring terms may be renewed or further modified at the end of the initial term for an additional period if performance has been acceptable and the short-term borrower difficulty persists.

Information with respect to the accrual status of our troubled debt restructurings is provided in the following table.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our troubled debt restructurings been current in accordance with their contractual terms was $978,000. We received $973,000 of interest payments on such loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest payments received on non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining book value of the loan (i.e., after charge-off of all identified losses) is deemed to be fully collectible. If the remaining book value is not deemed to be fully collectible, all payments received are applied to unpaid principal. Determination as to the ultimate collectability of the remaining book value is supported by an updated credit department evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors.

If a restructured loan is current in all respects and a minimum of six consecutive restructured payments have been received, it can be considered for return to accrual status. After a restructured loan that is current in all respects reverts to contractual/market terms, if a credit department review indicates no evidence of elevated market risk, the loan is removed from the troubled debt restructuring classification.

Loan Delinquency. The following table summarizes loan delinquency in total dollars and as a percentage of the total loan portfolio:

Past due loans decreased by $22.6 million, or 66.2%, to $11.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $34.1 million at December 31, 2014. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased by $16.2 million, or 64.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 while loans past due less than 90 days decreased by $6.4 million, or 71.2%. The $16.2 million decrease in loans past due 90 days or more was primarily due to a decrease in the multi-family of $9.2 million and one- to four-family of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The $6.4 million decrease in loans past due less than 90 days or more was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million decrease in loans collateralized by one- to four-family loans.

&#160;

Potential Problem Loans. We define potential problem loans as substandard loans which are still accruing interest. We do not necessarily expect to realize losses on all potential problem loans, but we recognize potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management. The aggregate principal amounts of potential problem loans as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $8.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively. Management believes it has established an adequate allowance for probable loan losses as appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles.

&#160;

Real Estate Owned.

Total real estate owned decreased by $9.5 million, or 50.9%, to $9.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $18.7 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, $15.6 million was transferred from loans to real estate owned upon completion of foreclosure including a $1.6 million relationship, a $1.5 million relationship, and a $1.2 million relationship. During the same period, sales of real estate owned totaled $23.4 million. In an effort to sell older properties, list prices were decreased which resulted in write-downs totaling $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

New appraisals received on real estate owned and collateral dependent impaired loans are based upon an "as is value" assumption. During the period of time in which we are awaiting receipt of an updated appraisal, loans evaluated for impairment based upon collateral value are measured by the following:

&#183; Applying an updated adjustment factor (as described previously) to an existing appraisal;

&#183; Confirming that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date;

&#183; Comparing the estimated current value of the collateral to that of updated sales values experienced on similar collateral;

&#183; Comparing the estimated current value of the collateral to that of updated values seen on current appraisals of similar collateral; and

&#183; Comparing the estimated current value to that of updated listed sales prices on our real estate owned and that of similar properties (not owned by the Company).

- 11 -

We owned 69 properties at December 31, 2015, compared to 142 properties as of December 31, 2014 and 158 properties at December 31, 2013. Habitable real estate owned is managed with the intent of attracting a lessee to generate revenue. Foreclosed properties are transferred to real estate owned at estimated net realizable value, with charge-offs, if any, charged to the allowance for loan losses upon transfer to real estate owned. The fair value is primarily based upon updated appraisals in addition to an analysis of current real estate market conditions.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We establish valuation allowances on loans that are deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral.

We also establish valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the loan portfolio. The risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience; the level of non-performing and classified assets; current economic conditions; volume, growth, and composition of the loan portfolio; adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay; the estimated value of any underlying collateral; regulatory guidance; and other relevant factors. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans and reduced by charge-offs. The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the WaterStone Bank board of directors. The allowance reflects management's best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio, and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the WaterStone Bank board of directors.

&#160;

Actual results could differ from this estimate, and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the WDFI, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review WaterStone Bank's allowance for loan losses. Such regulators have the authority to require WaterStone Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their review or examination.

Any loan that is 90 or more days past due is placed on non-accrual and classified as a non-performing asset. A loan is classified as impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Non-performing assets are then evaluated and accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

All impaired loans meeting the criteria established by management are evaluated individually, based primarily on the value of the collateral securing each loan and the ability of the borrowers to repay according to the terms of the loans, or based upon an analysis of the present value of the expected future cash flows under the original contract terms as compared to the modified terms in the case of certain troubled debt restructurings. Specific loss allowances are established as required by this analysis. At least once each quarter, management evaluates the appropriateness of the balance of the allowance for loan losses based on several factors some of which are not loan specific, but are reflective of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. This process includes, but is not limited to, a periodic review of loan collectability in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of loan activity, conditions that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay, underlying value of collateral and economic conditions in our immediate market area. All loans for which a specific loss review is not required are segregated by loan type and a loss allowance is established by using loss experience data and management's judgment concerning other matters it considers significant including trends in non-performing loan balances, impaired loan balances, classified asset balances and the current economic environment. The allowance is allocated to each category of loans based on the results of the above analysis.

The above analysis is both quantitative and subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels appropriate to absorb probable and estimable losses, additions may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the current environment.

At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $16.2 million, compared to $18.7 million at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was 1.45% and equal to 91.94% of non-performing loans, compared to 1.71%, and 49.21%, respectively at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a continued stabilization in both the quality of the loan portfolio as well as the overall local real estate market. During each period we experienced a stabilization or improvement in a number of key loan-related loan quality metrics, including impaired loans, substandard loans, loans contractually past due and non-accrual loans.

Net charge-offs totaled $4.5 million, or an annualized 0.37% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $6.7 million, or an annualized 0.55% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $2.2 million decrease in net charge-offs was primarily the result of a decrease in charge-offs related to loans secured by multi-family residential loans, which decreased $3.0 million, or 56.5%, to $2.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by charge-offs related to loans secured by one- to four-family residential loans, which increased $1.4 million, or 59.0%, to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Mortgage Banking Activity

In addition to the lending activities previously discussed, we also originate residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market through Waterstone Mortgage Corporation. We originated $2.0 billion in mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was an increase of $324.8 million, or 19.5%, from the $1.7 billion originated during the year ended December 31, 2014. Proceeds from sales to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The loans sold volume increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 such that total mortgage banking segment revenues increased $19.8 million, or 24.2%, to $101.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $81.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan production volume was driven by an increase in demand for mortgage purchase and refinance products. In addition, margins increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing.

Our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Loans originated for the purchase of a residential property, which generally yield a higher margin than loans originated for refinancing existing loans, comprised 83.7% of total originations during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 87.0% of total originations during the year ended December 31, 2014. The mix of loan type trended slightly towards more conventional loans and less governmental loans comprising 66.4% and 33.6% of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared 62.6% and 37.4% of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Investment Activities

Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. is WaterStone Bank's investment subsidiary headquartered in the State of Nevada. &#160; Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. manages the back office function for WaterStone Bank's investment portfolio. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer are responsible for executing purchase and sales in accordance with our investment policy and monitoring the investment activities of Wauwatosa Investments, Inc. The investment policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of our board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated by the board to designated employees. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by management, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer who may act jointly in performing security trades. The Chief Financial Officer and Treasury Officer are responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment. The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasury Officer are authorized to execute investment transactions (purchases and sales) without the prior approval of the board provided they are within the scope of the established Investment Policy.

&#160;

Our investment policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Investment decisions are based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine its quality, inherent risks, fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives, effect on our risk-based capital measurement and prospects for yield and/or appreciation.

Consistent with our overall business and asset/liability management strategy, which focuses on sustaining adequate levels of core earnings, our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities that are classified as available for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2015, one municipal security was sold with a total book value of $991,000 was sold at a gain of $44,000. During the year ended December 31, 2014, no investment securities were sold. During the year ended December 31, 2013, municipal securities with a total book value of $930,000 were sold at a loss of $9,000.

Available for Sale Portfolio

Government Sponsored Enterprise Bonds. &#160; At December 31, 2015, our Government sponsored enterprise bond portfolio totaled $3.7 million, all of which were issued by Federal National Mortgage Associated (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and were classified as available for sale. The weighted average yield on these securities was 1.04% and the weighted average remaining average life was 1.9 years at December 31, 2015. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and prepayment protection. The estimated fair value of our government sponsored enterprise bond portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $4,000 less than the amortized cost of $3.8 million.

Mortgage-backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. &#160; We purchase mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk. We regularly monitor the credit quality of this portfolio.

Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. These securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage related securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as WaterStone Bank, and in the case of government agency sponsored issues, guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees, if any, and credit enhancements. These fixed-rate securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans.

At December 31, 2015, mortgage-backed securities totaled $96.7 million. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.35% and a weighted average remaining life of 4.3 years at December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $755,000 more than the amortized cost of $95.9 million. Mortgage-backed securities valued at $77.5 million are pledged as collateral for borrowings at December 31, 2015. A $2.5 million mortgage-backed security is pledged as collateral for mortgage banking activity at December 31, 2015. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since all of our mortgage-backed securities have a fixed rate of interest. The relatively short weighted average remaining life of our mortgage-backed security portfolio mitigates our potential risk of loss in a rising interest rate environment.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $70.4 million. At December 31, 2015, the collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio consisted entirely of securities backed by government sponsored enterprises or U.S. Government agencies. The collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.11% and a weighted average remaining life of 3.3 years at December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of our collateralized mortgage obligations portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $177,000 less than the amortized cost of $70.6 million. Collateralized mortgage obligations valued at $16.6 million are pledged as collateral for borrowings at December 31, 2015. Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since all of our collateralized mortgage obligations have a fixed rate of interest. The relatively short weighted average remaining life of our collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio mitigates our potential risk of loss in a rising interest rate environment.

&#160;

Municipal Obligations. &#160; These securities consist of obligations issued by school districts, counties and municipalities or their agencies and include general obligation bonds, industrial development revenue bonds and other revenue bonds. Our Investment Policy requires that such municipal obligations be rated A+ or better by a nationally recognized rating agency at the date of purchase. A security that is downgraded below investment grade will require additional analysis of creditworthiness and a determination will be made to hold or dispose of the investment. At December 31, 2015, our municipal obligations portfolio totaled $79.2 million, all of which was classified as available for sale. The weighted average yield on this portfolio was 3.70% at December 31, 2015, with a weighted average remaining life of 7.5 years. The estimated market value of our municipal obligations bond portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million more than the amortized cost of $77.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company identified two municipal securities that were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Both securities were issued by a tax incremental district in a municipality located in Wisconsin. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company's analysis of these securities resulted in $100,000 in credit losses that were charged to earnings with respect to these two municipal securities. An additional $17,000 in credit losses were deemed necessary on the two securities during the year ended December 31, 2014. No additional other-than-temporary impairment was deemed necessary on these two securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. These securities had a combined amortized cost of $198,000 and a total life-to-date impairment of $117,000 as of December 31, 2015.

Other Debt Securities. As of December 31, 2015, we held other debt securities with a fair value of $17.0 million and amortized cost of $17.4 million. Other debt securities include &#160; a trust preferred security issued by a financial institution and corporate bonds. The weighted average yield on this portfolio is 4.45% at December 31, 2015, with a weighted average remaining life of 16.6 years.

Certificates of Deposit. At December 31, 2015, we held certificates of deposit with a fair value and amortized cost of $2.7 million. The weighted average yield on these securities was 1.09% and the weighted average remaining average life was 1.3 years at December 31, 2015. While these certificates generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and prepayment protection.

Sources of Funds

General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also rely on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and borrowings from other commercial banks in the form of repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities. In addition to deposits and borrowings, we derive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, economic conditions and competition from other financial institutions.

&#160;

Deposits. &#160; A majority of our depositors are persons who work or reside in Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties and, to a lesser extent, other southeastern Wisconsin communities. We offer a selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and fixed-term certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. As of December 31, 2015, certificates of deposit comprised 72.8% of total customer deposits, and had a weighted average cost of 0.97% on that date. Our reliance on certificates of deposit has resulted in a higher cost of funds than would otherwise be the case if demand deposits, savings and money market accounts made up a larger part of our deposit base. Development of our branch network and expansion of our commercial products and services and aggressively seeking lower cost savings, checking and money market accounts are expected to result in decreased reliance on higher-cost certificates of deposit.

Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. To attract and retain deposits, we rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships and competitive interest rates. We also provide remote deposit capture, internet banking and mobile banking.

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on historical experience, management believes our deposits are relatively stable. The ability to attract and maintain money market accounts and certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $650.1 million and $652.6 million of our deposit accounts were certificates of deposit, of which $508.4 million and $417.5 million, respectively, had maturities of one year or less.

Deposits increased by $29.4 million, or 3.4%, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was the result of a $32.0 million, or 15.1%, increase in total transaction accounts due to increasing our branch network, offset by a $2.6 million, or 0.4%, decrease in time deposits. &#160; The Company had no deposits obtained from brokers as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Supervision and Regulation

General

WaterStone Bank is a stock savings bank organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The lending, investment, and other business operations of WaterStone Bank are governed by Wisconsin law and regulations, as well as applicable federal law and regulations, and WaterStone Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. WaterStone Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the WDFI and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. WaterStone Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. WaterStone Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

&#160;

Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as WaterStone Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.

In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.

As a savings and loan holding company, Waterstone Financial is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Waterstone Financial is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.

Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the WDFI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Waterstone Financial, WaterStone Bank and Waterstone Mortgage Corporation.

Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to WaterStone Bank, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation and Waterstone Financial. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on WaterStone Bank, Waterstone Mortgage Corporation and Waterstone Financial.

Intrastate and Interstate Merger and Branching Activities

Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Any Wisconsin savings bank meeting certain requirements may, upon approval of the WDFI, establish one or more branch offices in the state of Wisconsin or the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio. In addition, upon WDFI approval, a Wisconsin savings bank may establish a branch office in any other state as the result of a merger or consolidation.

Federal Law and Regulation . The Interstate Banking Act permits the federal banking agencies to, under certain circumstances, approve acquisition transactions between banks located in different states, regardless of whether an acquisition would be prohibited under state law. The Interstate Banking Act, as amended, authorizes de novo branching into another state at locations at which banks chartered by the host state could establish a branch. Additionally, the IBA authorizes branching by merger, subject to certain state law limitations.

&#160;

Loans and Investments

Wisconsin Law and Regulations. Under Wisconsin law and regulation, WaterStone Bank is authorized to make, invest in, sell, purchase, participate or otherwise deal in mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans without geographic restriction, including loans made on the security of residential and commercial property. Wisconsin savings banks also may lend funds on a secured or unsecured basis for business, commercial or agricultural purposes, provided the total of all such loans does not exceed 20% of the savings bank's total assets, unless the WDFI authorizes a greater amount. Loans are subject to certain other limitations, including percentage restrictions based on total assets.

Wisconsin savings banks may invest funds in certain types of debt and equity securities, including obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies. Subject to prior approval of the WDFI, compliance with capital requirements and certain other restrictions, Wisconsin savings banks may invest in residential housing development projects. Wisconsin savings banks may also invest in service corporations or subsidiaries with the prior approval of the WDFI, subject to certain restrictions. Similarly, the line of credit that WaterStone Bank provides to Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject to the approval of the WDFI.

Wisconsin savings banks may make loans and extensions of credit, both direct and indirect, to one borrower in amounts up to 15% of the savings bank's capital plus an additional 10% for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. In addition, and notwithstanding the 15% of capital and additional 10% of capital limitations set forth above, Wisconsin savings banks may make loans to one borrower, or a related group of borrowers, for any purpose in an amount not to exceed $500,000, or to develop domestic residential housing units in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $30 million or 30% of the savings bank's capital, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank did not have any loans which exceeded the "loans-to-one borrower" limitations.

In addition, under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank must qualify for and maintain a level of qualified thrift investments equal to 60% of its assets as prescribed in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A Wisconsin savings bank that fails to meet this qualified thrift lender test becomes subject to certain operating restrictions otherwise applicable only to commercial banks. At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank maintaine d 92.1% of its assets in qualified thrift investments and therefore met the qualified thrift lender requirement.

Federal Law and Regulation . Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations also govern the equity investments of WaterStone Bank and, notwithstanding Wisconsin law and regulations, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations prohibit WaterStone Bank from making certain equity investments and generally limit WaterStone Bank's equity investments to those that are permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries. Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, WaterStone Bank must obtain prior Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval before directly, or indirectly through a majority-owned subsidiary, engaging "as principal" in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless certain exceptions apply. The activity regulations provide that state banks that meet applicable minimum capital requirements would be permitted to engage in certain activities that are not permissible for national banks, including certain real estate and securities activities conducted through subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will not approve an activity that it determines presents a significant risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance fund. The current activities of WaterStone Bank and its subsidiaries are permissible under applicable federal regulations.

Loans to, and other transactions with, affiliates of WaterStone Bank, such as Waterstone Financial, are restricted by the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder. See "&#8212;Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders" below.

&#160;

Lending Standards

Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Wisconsin law and regulations issued by the WDFI impose on Wisconsin savings banks certain fairness in lending requirements and prohibit savings banks from discriminating against a loan applicant based upon the applicant's physical condition, developmental disability, sex, marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, religion or ancestry.

Federal Law and Regulation . The federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate. Under the joint regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies, all insured depository institutions, such as WaterStone Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and loan documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators.

The Interagency Guidelines, among other things, require a depository institution to establish internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the following supervisory limits:

&#160; &#8226;

for loans secured by raw land, the supervisory loan-to-value limit is 65% of the value of the collateral;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

for land development loans (i.e., loans for the purpose of improving unimproved property prior to the erection of structures), the supervisory limit is 75%;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

for loans for the construction of commercial, over four-family or other non-residential property, the supervisory limit is 80%;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

for loans for the construction of one- to four-family properties, the supervisory limit is 85%; and

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

for loans secured by other improved property (e.g., farmland, completed commercial property and other income-producing property, including non-owner occupied, one- to four-family property), the limit is 85%.

Although no supervisory loan-to-value limit has been established for owner-occupied, one- to four-family and home equity loans, the Interagency Guidelines state that for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90% at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.

Deposits

Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank is permitted to establish deposit accounts and accept deposits. WaterStone Bank's board of directors, or its designee, determines the rate and amount of interest to be paid on or credited to deposit accounts subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limitations.

Deposit Insurance

Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under Wisconsin law, WaterStone Bank is required to obtain and maintain insurance on its deposits from a deposit insurance corporation. The deposits of WaterStone Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Federal Law and Regulation. &#160; WaterStone Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, generally up to a maximum of $250,000.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment against all depository institutions. An institution's assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 &#189; to 45 basis points of each institution's total assets less tangible capital. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution's aggregate deposits.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of WaterStone Bank. We cannot predict what deposit insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (FICO) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the annualized FICO assessment was equa l to 0.60 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.

Capitalization

Wisconsin Law and Regulation . Wisconsin savings banks are required to maintain a minimum capital to assets ratio of 6% and must maintain total capital necessary to ensure the continuation of insurance of deposit accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If the WDFI determines that the financial condition, history, management or earning prospects of a savings bank are not adequate, the WDFI may require a higher minimum capital level for the savings bank. If a Wisconsin savings bank's capital ratio falls below the required level, the WDFI may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the WDFI to correct the savings bank's capital deficiency, as well as a number of other restrictions on the savings bank's operations, including a prohibition on the declaration of dividends. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, WaterStone Bank's capital to assets ratio, as calculated under Wisconsin law, was 20.43% and 19.33%, respectively.

&#160;

Federal Law and Regulation . Federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders' equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

- 20 -

In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, including the bank's exposure to interest rate risk. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary due to a determination that an institution's capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of particular circumstances.

&#160;

Safety and Soundness Standards

Each federal banking agency, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action

Federal bank regulatory authorities are required to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, as amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate the previously mentioned amendments to the regulatory capital requirements, a bank is deemed to be (i) "well capitalized" if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or more, and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a Tier 1 leveraged capital ratio of 4.0% or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or more, and does not meet the definition of "well capitalized"; (iii) "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%; (iv) "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.

Federal law and regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an institution classified as less than well capitalized to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may order savings banks that have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a savings bank that is categorized as "undercapitalized" is subject to growth limitations and is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a savings bank is required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan. A "significantly undercapitalized" savings bank may be subject to additional restrictions. Savings banks deemed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be "critically undercapitalized" would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank was considered well-capitalized with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 29.67%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 20.45%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 29.67% and a total risk based capital ratio of 30.92%.

&#160;

Dividends

Under Wisconsin law and applicable regulations, a Wisconsin savings bank that meets its regulatory capital requirements may declare dividends on capital stock based upon net profits to the Parent company, provided that its paid-in surplus equals its capital stock. If the paid-in surplus of the savings bank does not equal its capital stock, the board of directors may not declare a dividend unless at least 10% of the net profits of the preceding half year, in the case of quarterly or semi-annual dividends, or 10% of the net profits of the preceding year, in the case of annual dividends, has been transferred to paid-in surplus. In addition, prior WDFI approval is required before dividends exceeding 50% of net profits for any calendar year may be declared and before a stock dividend may be declared out of retained earnings. Under WDFI regulations, a Wisconsin savings bank which has converted from mutual to stock form also is prohibited from paying a dividend on its capital stock if the payment causes the regulatory capital of the savings bank to fall below the amount required for its liquidation account.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to prohibit WaterStone Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of WaterStone Bank. Institutions may not pay dividends if they would be "undercapitalized" following payment of the dividend within the meaning of the prompt corrective action regulations.

Information with respect to dividends declared and paid by Waterstone Financial is disclosed under Holding Company Dividends.

Liquidity and Reserves

Wisconsin Law and Regulation. Under WDFI regulations, all Wisconsin savings banks are required to maintain a certain amount of their assets as liquid assets, consisting of cash and certain types of investments. The exact amount of assets a savings bank is required to maintain as liquid assets is set by the WDFI, but generally ranges from 4% to 15% of the savings bank's average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts plus short-term borrowings (the "Required Liquidity Ratio"). At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank's Required Liquidity Ratio was 8.0%, and WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement. In addition, 50% of the liquid assets maintained by a Wisconsin savings bank must consist of "primary liquid assets," which are defined to include securities issued by the United States Government and United States Government agencies. At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

- 21 -

Federal Law and Regulation . Under federal law and regulations, WaterStone Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking practices. Regulation D, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, imposes reserve requirements on all depository institutions, including WaterStone Bank, which maintain transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. Checking accounts, NOW accounts, Super NOW checking accounts, and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits (including certain money market deposit accounts) at a savings institution. For 2016, a depository institution is required to maintain average daily reserves equal to 3% on the first $110.2 million of transaction accounts, plus 10% of that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempt from the reserve requirements. These percentages and threshold limits are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board. Savings institutions have authority to borrow from the Federal Reserve's "discount window," but Federal Reserve policy generally requires savings institutions to exhaust all other sources before borrowing from the Federal Reserve. As of December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank met its Regulation D reserve requirements.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

Wisconsin Law and Regulation . Under Wisconsin law, a savings bank may not make a loan to a person owning 10% or more of its stock, an affiliated person, agent, or attorney of the savings bank, either individually or as an agent or partner of another, except as under the rules of the WDFI and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, unless the prior approval of the WDFI is obtained, a savings bank may not purchase, lease or acquire a site for an office building or an interest in real estate from an affiliated person, including a shareholder owning more than 10% of its capital stock, or from any firm, corporation, entity or family in which an affiliated person or 10% shareholder has a direct or indirect interest.

Federal Law and Regulation. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between an insured savings bank, such as WaterStone Bank, and any of its affiliates, including Waterstone Financial. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted Regulation W, which comprehensively implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior Federal Reserve Board interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B.

An affiliate of a savings bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the savings bank. A subsidiary of a savings bank that is not also a depository institution or a "financial subsidiary" under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the savings bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a savings bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which a savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such savings bank's capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. The statutory sections also require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans and other extensions of credit by a savings bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any covered transaction by a savings bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a savings bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings bank as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.

A savings bank's loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider's related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider's related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to WaterStone Bank's loans. All loans by a savings bank to its insiders and insiders' related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer's children and certain loans secured by the officer's residence, may not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the savings bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the savings bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider's related interests, would exceed either $500,000 or the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the savings bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability.

An exception to this requirement is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the savings bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. Consistent with these requirements, the Bank offered employees special terms for home mortgage loans on their principal residences. Effective April 1, 2006, this program was discontinued for new loan originations. Under the terms of the discontinued program, the employee interest rate is based on the Bank's cost of funds on December 31st of the immediately preceding year and is adjusted annually. At December 31, 2015, the rate of interest on an employee rate mortgage loan was 1.73%, compared to the weighted average rate of 4.31% on all single family mortgage loans. This rate decreased to 1.72% effective March 1, 2016. Employee rate mortgage loans totaled $2.2 million, or 0.2%, of our residential mortgage loan portfolio on December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Transactions between Bank Customers and Affiliates

Under Wisconsin and federal laws and regulations, Wisconsin savings banks, such as WaterStone Bank, are subject to the prohibitions on certain tying arrangements. A savings bank is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service to a customer, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that such customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.

Examinations and Assessments

WaterStone Bank is required to file periodic reports with and is subject to periodic examinations by the WDFI and FDIC. Federal regulations require annual on-site examinations for all depository institutions except certain well-capitalized and highly rated institutions with assets of less than $500 million which are examined every 18 months. Recent legislation extended the 18 month examination cycle to qualifying institutions of less than $1 billion in assets, subject to agency implementing regulations. WaterStone Bank is required to pay examination fees and annual assessments to fund its supervision.

Customer Privacy

Under Wisconsin and federal law and regulations, savings banks, such as WaterStone Bank, are required to develop and maintain privacy policies relating to information on its customers, restrict access to and establish procedures to protect customer data. Applicable privacy regulations further restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties if the customer requests.

Community Reinvestment Act

Under the Community Reinvestment Act, WaterStone Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of WaterStone Bank, to assess WaterStone Bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's evaluation of certain applications by WaterStone Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank's Community Reinvestment Act performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, WaterStone Bank was rated "satisfactory" with respect to its Community Reinvestment Act compliance.

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Federal Home Loan Bank System, consisting of 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The designated duties of the Federal Housing Finance Board are to supervise the Federal Home Loan Banks; ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks carry out their housing finance mission; ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks remain adequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets; and ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks operate in a safe and sound manner.

WaterStone Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in specified amounts. WaterStone Bank is in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock of $19.5 million at December 31, 2015.

Among other benefits, the Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Federal Housing Finance Board and the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank had $350.0 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.

USA PATRIOT Act

The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") has resulted in significant changes to the regulation of insured depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated as of July 21, 2011. Responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks was transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is the agency that is currently primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. At the same time, responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies, such as Waterstone Financial, was transferred to the Federal Reserve Board, which also supervises bank holding companies.

&#160;

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements. Institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, however, such as WaterStone Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of, their primary bank regulators rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

In addition to eliminating the Office of Thrift Supervision and creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, required originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, provided for regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or require the issuance of implementing regulations. Their impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for WaterStone Bank and Waterstone Financial.

Volcker Rule

&#160; Effective December 10, 2013, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking and securities regulators issued Final Rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Volcker Rule"). The Final Rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The Final Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The Final Rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the Final Rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company and Bank. The Final Rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period was extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2015. The Company has evaluated the implications of the Final Rules on its investments and concluded there were no material financial implications. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; Under the Final Rules, banking entities would have been prohibited from owning certain Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) backed by Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS) as of July 21, 2015, which could have forced banking entities to recognize unrealized market losses based on the inability to hold any such investments to maturity. However, on January 14, 2014, the U.S. financial regulators issued an interim rule ("Interim Rule"), effective April 1, 2014, exempting TruPS CDOs from the Volcker Rule if (i) the CDO was established prior to May 19, 2010, (ii) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds of the CDO were used to invest primarily in TruPS issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets, and (iii) the banking entity acquired the CDO on or before December 10, 2013. The Company currently does not have any impermissible holdings of TruPS CDOs under the Interim Rule, and therefore, will not be required to divest of any such investments or change the accounting treatment. However, regulators are soliciting comments to the Interim Rule, and this exemption could change prior to its effective date.

Regulation of Waterstone Mortgage Corporation

Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on its business. These laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions to which Waterstone Mortgage Corporation is subject include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with net worth and financial statement delivery requirements; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers; and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation may also be required to comply with any additional requirements that its customers may be subject to by their regulatory authorities.

&#160;

Holding Company Regulation

Waterstone Financial is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Waterstone Financial and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to WaterStone Bank. In addition, any company that owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the voting securities of a state savings bank is subject to regulation as a savings bank holding company by the WDFI. Waterstone Financial is subject to regulation as a savings bank holding company under Wisconsin law. However, the WDFI has not issued specific regulations governing savings bank holding companies.

As a savings and loan holding company, Waterstone Financial's activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if Waterstone Financial makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and meets the other requirements to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation.

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies.

&#160;

Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements, although bank holding companies have been. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The final capital rule discussed above implemented the consolidated capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies (of greater than $1 billion in consolidated assets), effective January 1, 2015. Waterstone Financial's consolidated capital exceeded the minimum requirements as of December 31, 2015.

The Dodd-Frank Act extended the "source of strength" doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company's overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Waterstone Financial to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

Holding Company Dividends

Waterstone Financial will not be permitted to pay dividends on its common stock if its stockholders' equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established by Waterstone Financial in connection with the conversion. The source of dividends will depend on the net proceeds retained by Waterstone Financial and earnings thereon, and dividends from WaterStone Bank. In addition, Waterstone Financial will be subject to state law limitations and federal bank regulatory policy on the payment of dividends. Maryland law generally limits dividends if the corporation would not be able to pay its debts in the usual course of business after giving effect to the dividend or if the corporation's total assets would be less than the corporation's total liabilities plus the amount needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.

&#160;

The dividend rate and continued payment of dividends will depend on a number of factors, including our capital requirements, our financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations, and general economic conditions.

&#160;

Federal Securities Laws Regulation

Securities Exchange Act. &#160; Waterstone Financial common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Waterstone Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Waterstone Financial may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Waterstone Financial are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Waterstone Financial meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Waterstone Financial that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate's sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Waterstone Financial, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, Waterstone Financial may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. &#160; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.

Change in Control Regulations

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as Waterstone Financial unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days' prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution's directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company's voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Waterstone Financial, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a "savings and loan holding company" subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

Further, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, no person may make an offer or announcement of an offer to purchase shares or actually acquire shares of a converted institution or its holding company for a period of three years from the date of the completion of the conversion if, upon the completion of such offer, announcement or acquisition, the person would become the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the outstanding stock of the institution or its holding company. The Federal Reserve Board has defined "person" to include any individual, group acting in concert, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or similar company, a syndicate or any other group formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities of an insured institution. However, offers made exclusively to a bank or its holding company, or to an underwriter or member of a selling group acting on the converting institution's or its holding company's behalf for resale to the general public, are excepted. The regulation also provides civil penalties for willful violation or assistance in any such violation of the regulation by any person connected with the management of the converting institution or its holding company or who controls more than 10% of the outstanding shares or voting rights of a converted institution or its holding company.

Federal and State Taxation

Federal Taxation

General. Waterstone Financial and subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Waterstone Financial and subsidiaries constitute an affiliated group of corporations and, therefore, are eligible to report their income on a consolidated basis. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Waterstone Financial or WaterStone Bank. The company is no longer subject to federal tax examinations for years before 2014.

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Waterstone Financial currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns.

Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), WaterStone Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, WaterStone Bank was required to use the specific charge-off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2015, WaterStone Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year.

Waterstone Financial is required to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions.

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if WaterStone Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if WaterStone Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a "bank" for tax purposes. At December 31, 2015, our total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve was approximately $16.7 million.

&#160;

Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Due to a federal net operating loss carry back generated in 2008, Waterstone Financial became subject to alternative minimum tax for 2006 and 2007. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no such amounts available as credits for carryover.

&#160;

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. A 2009 federal tax law change allows for a one-time carry back of either 2008 or 2009 taxable losses for up to five years. Waterstone Financial had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $3.0 million at December 31, 2011, which was fully utilized during the year ended December 31, 2012.

&#160;

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Waterstone Financial may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from WaterStone Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20% of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends-received deduction is 70% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20% of the distributing corporation.

State Taxation

The Company is subject to primarily the Wisconsin corporate franchise (income) tax and taxation in a number of states due primarily to the operations of the mortgage banking segment. Under current law, the state of Wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of 7.9% on the combined taxable incomes of the members of our consolidated income tax group.

&#160; The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations by certain state tax authorities for years before 2011.

As a Maryland business corporation, Waterstone Financial is required to file an annual report and pay franchise taxes to the state of Maryland.
