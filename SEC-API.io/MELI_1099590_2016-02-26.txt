 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

MercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) hosts the largest online commerce platform in Latin America, which is focused on enabling e-commerce and its related services. Our platforms are designed to provide our users with a complete portfolio of services facilitating e-commerce transactions. We are market leaders in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on unique visitors and page views. We also operate online commerce platforms in the Dominican Republic, Panama , Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay and Portugal. 

Through our online commerce platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust online commerce environment that fosters the development of a large and growing e-commerce community in Latin America, a regi on with a population of over 605 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer a technological and commercial solution that addresses the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America. 

We offer our users an eco-system of six related e-commerce services: the MercadoLibre Marketplace, The MercadoLibre Classifieds Service, the MercadoPago payments solution, the MercadoLibre Advertising program (&#8220;MercadoClics&#8221;) , the MercadoShops on-line webstores solution and the MercadoEnvios shipping service. 

The MercadoLibre Marketplace, which we regularly refer to as our marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce service. This service permits both businesses and individuals to list general merchandising items and conduct their sales and purchases &#160; online in either a fixed-price or auction-based format. Any Internet user in the countries in which we operate can browse through the various products that are listed on our website and register with the MercadoLibre Marketplace to list, bid for and purchase such items and services. 

To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we &#160; developed the MercadoPago , an integrated online payments solution. &#160; MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely , &#160; easily and promptly send, receive and finance payments online. Mercado Pago is currently available in: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Col o mbia, Venezuela and Chile. 

Through MercadoLibre Classified s Service, our online classified listing service, our users can offer for sale and generate leads on listings in these non-general merchandising categories. 

As a further enhancement to the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed our MercadoLibre Advertising program to enable businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet. Through MercadoLibre Advertising, users and advertisers are able to place display and/or text advertisements on our web pages in order to promote their brands and offerings. MercadoLibre Advertising offers advertisers a cost efficient and automated solution that enables advertisers to acquire traffic through advertisements placed on our platform. Advertisers purchase, on a cost per click basis, advertising space that appears around product search results for specific categories and other pages. These advertising placements are clearly differentiated from product search results and direct traffic both to and from our platform depending on the advertiser. 

Additionally, during 2010, we launched the MercadoShops on-line webstores solution. Through MercadoShops, users can set-up, manage and promote their own on-line webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and value added services on their webstores. 

To close out our suite of e-commerce services, during 2013 and 2014, we launched the MercadoEnvios shipping solution in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico , while during the second quarter of 2015 we launched our shipping solution in Colombia . Through MercadoEnvios, we offer a cost efficient integration with existing logistic and shipping carr iers to sellers on our platform . Sellers opting into the program are able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices . 

At last , MercadoLibre develops and sells software enterprise solutions to &#160; e-commerce business clients in Brazil since the second quarter of 2015. 

History of MercadoLibre 

In March of 1999, Marcos Galperin, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, wrote our business plan while working towards his master&#8217;s degree in business administration at Stanford Business School. Shortly thereafter, he began to assemble a team of professionals to implement it. We were incorporated in Delaware in October of 1999. 

&#160; 

We commenced operations in Argentina in August of 1999 and subsequently began operations in other countries as well. The following table shows the timeline of different launches and events in each country:

We closed our office s in Chile in 2009. In 2014, we acquired Portal Inmobiliario with offices in Chile. 

Our business is organized using the same technological platform in each country where we operate. However, the site of each country has its own specific local website which has no interaction with our website in other countries. For example, searches carried out on our Brazilian website show only results of listings uploaded on that particular website and do not show listings from other countries. 

We received two rounds of financing in addition to our initial seed funding. The first round was carried out in November of 1999, resulting in proceeds to us of $7.6 million from investors that included J.P. Morgan Partners BHCA L.P., Flatiron Fund entities and Hicks, Muse, Tate &#38; Furst. The second round of financing occurred in May of 2000 and raised $46.7 million from, among others, Goldman Sachs entities (GS Capital Partners III, L.P., GS Capital Partners III Offshore, L.P. and Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. Verwaltungs GmbH), Capital Riesgo Internet SCR S.A. (CRI Banco Santander Central Hispano), GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc., J.P. Morgan Partners BHCA L.P. and Hicks, Muse, Tate &#38; Furst. 

In September 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance with eBay Inc., (&#8220; eBay &#8221;) , which became one of our stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American e-commerce community. As part of this strategic alliance, we acquired eBay&#8217;s Brazilian subsidiary at the time, iBazar, and eBay agreed not to compete with us in the region during the term of the agreement which ended on September 24, 2006. During this term, this agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our development. Even though eBay is one of our stockholders, since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay from becoming one of our competitors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;We operate in a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service.&#8221; 

In November 2002, we acquired certain key strategic assets of Lokau.com , a competing Brazilian online commerce platform and we incorporated all registered users of Lokau.com into our platform. 

In November 2005, we acquired certain operations of a regional competitor in e-commerce, DeRemate.com Inc., or DeRemate, including all of its operations and the majority of the shares of capital stock of its subsidiaries in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela for an aggregate purchase price of $12.1 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition increased our user base by approximately 1.3 million confirmed registered users and solidified our market leadership position in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay. W e did not acquire DeRemate&#8217;s Argentine and Chilean subsidiaries in 2005. Instead, these subsidiaries continued to operate under the control of certain previous stockholders of DeRemate until 2008. 

In August 2007, we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which 2,608,696 shares of common stock were sold by us, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $49.6 million, and 13,468,489 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders. 

In January 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Classified Media Group, Inc., or CMG, and its subsidiaries for an aggregate purchase price of $19.0 million. CMG and its subsidiaries operate an online classified advertisements platform primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.tucarro.com in Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico and real estate at www.tuinmueble.com in Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, the United States, Costa Rica and the Canary Islands. 

In September 2008, we acquired the remaining operations of DeRemate.com in Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia for an aggregate purchase price of $37.6 million and we also purchased certain URLs, domains, trademarks, databases and intellectual property rights from it for $2.4 million, subject to certain set off rights and working capital adjustment clauses. 

In September 2011, we acquired 60% of the outstanding membership interests of Autopark LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, which holds 100% of the ownership interests of AP Clasificados, an online classified advertisements platform in 

&#160;

Mexico primarily dedicated to the sale of vehicles at www.autoplaza.com.mx and real estate at www.homeshop.com.mx. The aggregate purchase price paid in cash was $5.5 million and includes URLs, domain names, trademarks, databases non-compete agreements and intellectual property rights that are used or useful in connection with the online platforms of the acquired business. Additionally, in December 2014, we exercised the call option and acquired the remaining 40% of the membership interests in Autopark LLC. we paid $4.0 million for this remaining 40% interest. 

In March 2013, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in an Argentine software development company located in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, for an aggregate purchase price of $3.4 million. The objective of this acquisition was to enhance our software development capabilities. 

In April 2014, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the companies VMK S.A., Inmobiliaria Web Chile S. de R.L. de C.V. and Inmuebles Online S.A., companies that operate online classified advertisements platforms dedicated to the sale of real estate in Chile through the Portal Inmobiliario brand ( www.portalinmobiliario.com ) and in Mexico through the Guia de Inmuebles brand ( www.guiadeinmuebles.com ) . The aggregate purchase price was $ 38.0 million. 

In December 2014, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Business Vision S.A., an Argentine software development company located in the city of Buenos Aires, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.8 million. The objective of this acquisition was to enhance our software development capabilities. 

In April 2015, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of KPL Solu&#231;&#245;es Ltda., a company that develops enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) software for the &#160; e-commerce industry in Brazil , for and aggregate purchase price of &#160;$2 2.7 &#160; million. The objective of this acquisition was to offer an even more seamless way for our customers to sell on our marketplace. 

Also in April 2015, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock o f Metros C&#250;bicos, S.A. de C.V., a company that operates an online classified advertisement platform dedicated to the sale of real estate in Mexico . The aggregate purchase price was $ 29.9 million. The objective of this acquisition was to increase our participation in the e-commerce business in that country. 

Our strategy 

We seek to serve people in Latin America by offering diverse e-commerce services that can improve the quality of life of those who use it, while creating significant value for our stockholders. We serve our buyers by giving them access to &#160; what we believe is a broader and more affordable variety of products and services than those available on other online and offline venues. We serve our sellers by allowing them to reach a larger and more geographically diverse user base at a lower overall cost and investment than offline venues. At the same time, we provide payment settlement services to facilitate such transactions, and advertising solutions to promote them. More broadly, we strive to make inefficient markets more efficient and in that process generate value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we intend to pursue the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Continue to grow our business and maintain market leadership . We have focused and intend to continue to focus on growing our business by strengthening our position as the preferred online marketplace in each of the countries in which we operate. We also intend to grow our business and maintain our leadership by taking advantage of the expanding potential user base that has resulted from the growth of Internet penetration rates in Latin America. We intend to achieve these goals through organic growth, by introducing our business in new countries and entering new category segments, by launching new transactional business endeavors, and through potential strategic acquisitions of key businesses and assets. In order to grow our core marketplace business, we must continue to attract larger sellers to our platform, including brands, manufacturers, and large retailers. Such sellers are recognizing the value of MercadoLibre as a sales channel, and having them on our site increases selection of quality products and enhances the MercadoLibre brand in the eyes of our users. Through our Official Stores initiative, we offer users a tailored experience with products sold directly from such sellers. Our sales team remains dedicated to attracting and supporting these new vendor segments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Increase monetization of our transactions . We have focused and will continue to focus on improving the revenue generation capacity of our business by implementing initiatives designed to maximize the revenues we receive from transactions on our platform. Some of these initiatives include increasing our fee structure, selling advertising on our platform, offering other e-commerce services and expanding our paid-for fee-based features. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Take advantage of the natural synergies that exist between our services. We strive to leverage our different businesses to promote greater cross-usage among the businesses, thereby creating a virtuous ecosystem of e-commerce offerings. We promote the adoption of our MercadoPago payments solution on our marketplace as well as on our MercadoShops solution, to offer our MercadoClics advertising solutions to users of our marketplace, payments and shops solutions, and to encourage users of any of our services to experiment with the other solutions we offer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Expand into additional transactional service offerings. Our strategic focus is to enable on-line transactions of multiple types of goods and services throughout Latin America. Consequently, we strive, and will continue to strive, to launch on-line transactional offerings in new product and service categories where we believe business opportunities exist. These new transactional offerings include, but are not limited to, efforts involving: (a) the offer ing of additional product categories in our marketplace business, (b) the expansion of our presence in vehicle, real estate and services classifieds, (c) the penetration of our on-platform payments services and the expansion of our off-platform payments services, (d) the penetration of our credit product offerings on and off our platform, (e) the penetration of our on-platform shipping service s and ( g ) the offer of on-line software as e-commerce service solutions. We believe that a significant portion of our growth will be derived from these new or expanded product and service launches in the future. We are especially focused on driving adoption of our payments , credit and shipping solutions on our platform. Both of these solutions drive a better customer experience for both buyers and sellers on our platform marketplace , eliminating friction around transactions and improving monetization . We must continue to drive adoption of these services in the countries where they are currently available, while rolling out t hese solutions in new markets. Payments outside of our platform also represent an enormous growth avenue , especially in payments processing and financing. As credit card adoption and bank account penetration continue to increase across Latin America, the market for online and mobile payments will grow significantly. We believe it is imperative that MercadoPago captures that opportunity, especially as eCommerce and the number of online sellers continue s to grow. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Enhance brand awareness . We believe that enhancing awareness of the MercadoLibre brand is important to achieve our business objectives. We intend to continue to promote and increase recognition of our brand through a variety of marketing and promotional campaigns. These may include marketing agreements with companies that have a significant online presence and advertising through traditional media, such as cable television. We may also use leading websites and other media such as affiliate programs, banner advertisements and keyword searches. In addition, we believe that by enhancing our e-commerce community experience, we promote greater brand awareness through word of mouth. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Focus on user loyalty and website enhancement . We will continue to focus on increasing purchase frequency and transaction volumes from our existing users. We intend to do so by maintaining an appealing and convenient platform for e-commerce, improving the functionality of our website to deliver a more efficient user experience and providing our users with the help of a dedicated customer support department. We employ a number of programs aimed to foster customer loyalty and repeated purchases, such as our MercadoLider loyalty program for high-volume sellers, our targeted and segmented direct marketing program, and MercadoPago special promotions and our MercadoEnvios shipping service. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Increase operational efficiency . We believe our business model provides us with an opportunity to generate healthy profit margins. We plan to maximize this potential by achieving economics of scale, maintaining controls on overhead costs and reducing variable costs whenever possible. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Continue to develop innovative and creative solutions . We intend to continually enhance our e-commerce platform in order to better serve both individuals and businesses that want to buy or sell goods and services online. We intend to continue investing to develop new tools and technologies that facilitate e-commerce on our platform and improve our users&#8217; online experience on MercadoLibre, while addressing the distinctive cultural, geographical and other challenges of online commerce in Latin America. Within our constant focus on innovation, a key component of user experience is the vertical solutions we offer across key categories. These tailored vertical solutions improve user experience and therefore conversion, enabling customers to browse categories by applying filters, rather than merely search for specific items. We have developed and continue to innovate on such vertical solutions for our classifieds sites for Motors, Real Estate, and Services. Furthermore, we provide such an experience for fashion and apparel on our marketplace, driving growth in that category. In order to improve the user experience, we must continue to innovate by improving our existing verticalized categories and creating vertical solutions for new categories. Another key component of innovation is our open platform initiative, which has enabled third-party developers to access MercadoLibre&#8217;s APIs in order to build solutions that help both sellers and buyers on our platform. We have set up a small venture fund to invest in such startups that integrate with our platform, making several investments to date in Argentina and Brazil. Our open platform also enables large sellers to directly integrate their systems with our site, enabling us to attract and integrate brands, manufacturers, and large retailers. We must continue to open our platform across all solutions in order to promote further development of third-party solutions and easier integration for large retailers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Serve our dynamic and active user community . We seek to operate MercadoLibre as an open and trusted web-based marketplace where users can access a broad market of products. We believe in treating our users with respect by applying a consistent set of policies that reinforce good online and offline behavior within our user community. We also seek to offer superior customer care in order to maintain the loyalty and satisfaction of our active user base. We continue to invest in customer experience to make it a competitive advantage. With roughly 1.38 0 customer service representatives across several countries, we strive to provide a superior experience to buyers and sellers, continuing to drive improvements in our Net Promot e r Score. 

The MercadoLibre Marketplace 

The MercadoLibre Marketplace is an Internet-based commerce platform where buyers and sellers can meet, and consummate e-commerce transactions for a wide range of goods and services. The MercadoLibre Marketplace allows sellers to reach a large number of potential buyers more cost-effectively than through traditional offline commerce channels or other online venues. Our platform is a fully-automated, topically- 

&#160;

arranged and user-friendly online commerce service which permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases online . Any Internet user can browse through the various products and services that are listed on our website and register for free wit h MercadoLibre to list, and purchase items and services. Additionally, sellers and advertisers can purchase, display and link advertising on our websites to promote their brands, businesses and products. The MercadoLibre Marketplace offers buyers a large selection of new and used items that are often more expensive or otherwise hard to find through traditional offline sellers, such as brick-and-mortar retail establishments, offline classified advertisements, community bulletin boards, auction houses and flea markets. 

Our MercadoLibre Marketplace is organized using the same technological platform in each country where we operate. However, the site of each country has its own specific local website which has no interaction with our website in other countries. For example, searches carried out on our Brazilian site show only results of listings uploaded on that particular site and do not show listings from other countries. During 2015, visitors to our website were able to browse an average of over 37.1 million Marketplace listings daily, organized by country, in over 2,800 different product categories. We believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers, sellers and product listings in most of the countries where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume. At December 31, 2015, we had over 144.6 million confirmed registered MercadoLibre Marketplace users, up from 120.9 million and 99.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2015, in our Marketplace, we had 6.2 million unique sellers, 23.6 million unique buyers and 128.4 million successful items sold as compared to i) 5.5 million unique sellers, 22.0 million unique buyers and 101.3 million successful items sold during 2014 and ii) 5.1 million unique sellers, 20.2 million unique buyers and 83.0 million successful items sold during 2013. Finally, our Marketplace gross merchandise volume (&#8220;GMV&#8221;) was $7.2 billion in 201 5 , as compared to $7. 1 billion in 201 4 and $ 7 . 3 billion in 201 3 . 

The MercadoLibre Classifieds Service 

The MercadoLibre Classifieds Service enables users to list their offerings related to vehicles, real estate, and services outside the M arketplace platform. Classifieds listings differ from M arketplace listings, as they only charge optional placement fees, and never final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our website , benefitting both M arketplace and non-marketplace businesses. 

In 2015, MercadoLibre visitors were able to browse an average of 1.7 million classifieds listings daily, including approximately 6 56 ,000 in Real Estate, 903 ,000 in motors, and 113 ,000 in services per day. During 2015, we had a total of 2.4 million unique sellers and 15.2 million paid listings through the MercadoLibre Classifieds Service , as compared to i) 2.3 million unique sellers and 11.6 million paid listings during 2014 and ii) 2.5 million unique sellers and 11.0 million paid listings during 2013. 

The MercadoPago online payments solution 

To complement the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution. MercadoPago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments online. MercadoPago enables any user registered with MercadoPago to securely and easily send and receive payments online to pay for purchases made in the MercadoLibre Marketplace. MercadoPago is currently available to MercadoLibre users in each of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Chile and Colombia. 

MercadoPago is also available for purchases of goods and services outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace, as an open on-line payment service in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Chile and Colombia. The off platform service is designed to meet the growing demand for Internet-based payments systems in Latin America. Users are able to transfer money to other users with MercadoPago accounts and to incorporate MercadoPago as a means of payments on their independent commerce websites. MercadoPago allows merchants to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their website and also enable users to simply transfer money to each other either through the website or using the MercadoPago App available in iOS and Android . MercadoPago allows merchants who are not registered with the MercadoLibre Marketplace to receive payments as long as they register with MercadoPago. It also allows consumers to pay MercadoPago registered-merchants either by registering with MercadoPago or by providing their credit card information as a &#8220;guest user&#8221;. 

Furthermore, MercadoPago offers online sellers who accept MercadoPago as a method of payment to integrate MercadoPago with their checkout flow , thereby streamlining the shopping and payment processes. We believe that the ease of use, safety and efficiency of MercadoPago will allow us to generate additional transactions in the future from web merchants that sell items outside the MercadoLibre Marketplace. We believe that there is a significant business opportunity to increase adoption of MercadoPago as a payment mechanism both on &#160; and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace for years to come . 

In July 2015, MercadoPago launched a mobile point of sale service in Brazil which allows merchants or individuals to process physical credit and debit cards, either by reading the chip and entering the personal identification number, or &#160; PIN, of the card or by swiping it, depending on the type of card. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, our on and off-platform users paid approximately $5,184.1 million using MercadoPago, which represented 72.5% of our g ross merchandise volume for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our on and off-platform users paid approximately $3,523.2 million using MercadoPago, which represented 49.7% of our gross merchandise volume for that year. During the year ended December 31, 2013, our users paid approximately $2,497.7 million using MercadoPago, which represented 34.2% of our gross merchandise volume for that year. 

&#160;

We seek to increase the adoption and penetration of MercadoPago among MercadoLibre Marketplace users. In the countries where MercadoPago was availab le, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 65.2% of the MercadoLibre Marketplace&#8217;s listings accepted MercadoPago for payments and 77.9% of our total gross merchandise volume (excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft and real estate) in these countries was completed through MercadoPago. Starting in Brazil in January 2010, in Argentina in March 2010, in Mexico in April 2011, in Venezuela in July 2012 and in Colombia in November 2013, all paid listings on the MercadoLibre Marketplace (excluding free listings and classifieds) were required to offer MercadoPago. 

MercadoEnvios shipping Service 

MercadoEnvios is a shipping solution for marketplace users , available in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico . Additionally, during the second half of 2015 we also launched our shipping solution in Colombia. MercadoEnvios achieves economies of scale through integration with local carriers driving down shipping costs and eliminating friction for buyers and sellers. 

MercadoLibre Advertising services 

The MercadoLibre Advertising platform, which we commonly refer to as &#8220;MercadoClics&#8221;, enables large retailers, small and medium brands and various other consumer brands to promote their products and services on the I nternet by providing branding and performance marketing solutions . Advertiser s place text, display or banner advertisements on our website in order to promote their brands and offer ings. MercadoClics is an a dvertising tool that enables advertisers to acquire traffic through text ads placed on search results on our platform. Advertisers can purchase specific categories, on a cost per click basis or per impression basis, where their advertisements could appear as a result of a bidding process with other relevant advertisements. 

MercadoShops online web stores service 

MercadoShops is a software-as-a-service, fully hosted online webstore solution. Through MercadoShops users can set-up, manage and promote on-line webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the other marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and added services on their webstores. 

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy is designed to grow our platform by promoting the MercadoLibre brand, attracting new users, and generating more frequent trading by our existing users. To this end, we employ various means of advertising, including placement in leading portals and networks across Latin America, cable and air television, paid and natural positioning in leading search engines, email marketing, onsi te marketing and presence in off line events. Our expenditures in marketing activities &#160; w ere $58.5 million during 2015, $50.6 million during 2014 and $38.1 million during 2013. 

Specifically, we rely mostly on online advertising to promote our brand and attract potential buyers and sellers to our websites and we complement this performance marketing strategy with specific offline activities. To summarize, we focus on the following key marketing initiatives: 

&#183; 

Entering into agreements with search platforms, portals, social networks and websites that we believe can reach our target audience. These agreements allow us to purchase online advertising positions where we can market ourselves and show relevant promotions to potential and registered users 

&#183; 

Investing in preferential placement on the most popular search engines in each country where we operate, such as Google Search. We purchase advertising space next to the results of more than 35 mill i on keywords related to our activities.

&#183; 

Continuing to focus on customizing our buying and selling experiences to make it easier for users to find and buy items by offering formats dedicated to specific categories. In 2015, we offered more &#8220;verticalized experiences&#8221;, adding new features in our Fashion, Autoparts and Home &#38; Garden categories as well as launching targeted advertising campaigns based on consumers&#8217; category preferences 

&#183; 

Accelerating our aggressive mobile marketing strategy. In 2015, we continued to develop our smartphone Apps, focusing mainly on obtaining additional App users 

&#183; 

Continuing to invest in offline and online marketing events around Black &#160; Friday and Cyber M onday, which were strong selling ev ents in all our markets in 2015 

&#183; 

Continuing to use radio and magazine ads to promote our vehicles&#8217; classifieds business , which &#160; category serves as a leader in all our markets 

&#183; 

Completing our first full year with the new Oracle Responsys , Oracle&#8217;s cross-channel solution for marketing to consumers, platform which allowed us to automate, escalate, and better orchestrate our email marketing program pro viding multichannel integration 

&#160; 

&#160;

We also conduct a variety of initiatives that focus on attracting and training sellers. We organize events such as &#8220;MercadoLibre Universities&#8221; and seller meetings in all countries where we have an office. MercadoLibre Universities are full-day sessions comprised of advanced users whom we teach how to sell on our platform. During seller meetings, we teach sellers with high-potential or with MercadoLider status more advanced selling techniques and allow them to discuss issues of interest with our employees. 

The positioning of the MercadoLibre brand among Internet users is one of our key marketing concerns, and our goal is to position MercadoLibre&#8217;s name and concept as the preferred platform in the public&#8217;s mind. In 2015 we launched our new regional advertising campaign, &#8220;Never Stop Seeking&#8221;, in online and offline media. We conduct surveys every year in our key markets to gauge the position of our brand in the minds of consumers. We consistently appear at the top of these surveys in areas such as consumer recall and preference for e-commerce and online commerce sites. We believe these ratings are the result of the quality of our product and our marketing efforts . 

Product development 

At December 31, 2015, we had 848 employees on our information technology and product development staff, an increase from 639 employees at December 31, 2014, due to new hires and as a consequence of the acquisition of KPL Solu&#231;&#245;es Ltda. in April 2015 which increased our information technology and product development staff by 92 employees. We incurred product development expenses (including salaries) in the amount of $76.4 million in 2015, $53.6 million in 2014 and $40.9 million in 2013. We also incurred information technology capital expenditures, including software licenses, amounting to $ 25 . 8 million in 2015, $22.7 million in 2014 and $22.0 million in 2013. 

We continually work to improve both our MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago websites so that they better serve our users&#8217; needs and function more efficiently. A significant portion of our information technology resources are allocated to these purposes. We strive to maintain the right balance between offering new features and enhancing the existing functionality and architecture of our software and hardware. 

The development of new and improved features usually begins by listening to suggestions from our community of users. We hold meetings periodically with both, regular and highly active users to obtain feedback regarding our services, as well as suggestions and ideas for possible additional features on the MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago websites . We also receive suggestions from our chat rooms and bulletin boards. Additionally, we monitor the market for new features, formats and elements that c ould be adapted to our platform to improve our users&#8217; experience. 

We place significant importance on the testing and implementation phase of newly developed features. After an internal team ensures that new features and upgrades are working properly, we typically involve a select group of users in testing these features before we release them to the general public. Through this process we receive feedback and suggestions on how to enhance the final details of a feature. Additionally, we typically introduce new features country by country, in order to isolate and resolve any potential problems and subsequently release improved versions to countries yet to be introduced to the new features. 

The adequate management of the MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago software architecture and hardware requirements is as important as introducing additional and better features for our users. Because our business grows relatively fast, we must ensure that our systems are capable of absorbing this incremental volume. Therefore, our engineers work to optimize our processes and equipment by designing more effective ways to run our platform . 

We develop most of our software technology in-house. Since our inception in 1999, we have had a development center in Buenos Aires where we concentrate the majority of our development efforts. In June of 2007, we also launched a second development center in the province of San Luis in Argentina. The center is a collaborative effort with the Technological University of La Punta. In this effort, the University offers us access to dedicated development facilities and a recruiting base for potential employees. In 2012, we opened our newest development center in Aguada Park, Montevideo, Uruguay, which is dedicated to software development activities. We also have other research and/or development centers in Brazil , &#160; Mexico and Venezuela. 

In March 2013, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in an Argentine software development company located in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, and in December 2014, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in a software development company based in the city of Buenos Aires. The objective of these acquisitions was to enhance our software development capabilities. 

While we have developed most of our software technology in-house, we also outsource certain projects to outside developers. We believe that outsourcing the development of these projects allows us to have a greater operating capacity and strengthens our internal know-how by incorporating new expertise to our business. In addition, our team of developers frequently interacts with technology suppliers and attends technology-related events to familiarize itself with the latest inventions and developments in the field. 

Since 2010, we have been continuously &#160; working on a deep technology overhaul that is allowing us to switch from a closed and monolithic system to an open and decoupled one. We are splittin g MercadoLibre into many small cells. A cell is a functional unit with its own team, hardware, data and source code. Cells interact with each other using Application Programming Interfaces, or API &#180;s . All the Front-Ends are also being rewritten on top of these APIs. This effort has consumed a large amount of capital, people and management &#8217;s focus, and we intend to keep investing in this area . On October 31, 2012, we opened our platform to the developers&#8217; community in a launching event that took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil . We seek to continue spreading the opening of our platform to developers in the other locations in which we operate with the objective of continuing to enhance our ecosystem. 

&#160;

We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to our services. The market in which we compete is ch aracterized by rapidly changing and disruptive &#160; technolog ies , evolving industry and regulatory standards, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. Accordingly, we believe &#160; the cornerstone of our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry and regulatory standards and to continually improve the performance, features , user experience and reliability of our service s in response to competitive product and service offerings and evolving demands of the marketplace. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to make substantial capital expenditures investments to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Our future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a cost-effective and timely manner, and on the continued market acceptance of our products and services.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

Like most retail businesses, we experience the effects of seasonality in all our operating territories throughout the calendar year. Although much of our seasonality is due to the Christmas holiday season, the geographic diversity of our operations helps mitigate the seasonality attributed to summer vacation time (i.e. &#160; southern and northern hemispheres) and national holidays. 

Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the Christmas season (see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Seasonality&#8221; for more detail). The first quarter of the year is generally our slowest period. The months of January, February and March correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in February or March. This first quarter seasonality is partially mitigated by our operations in &#160; the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, the slowest months for which are the summer months of July, August and September. 

Competition 

The market for trading over the Internet is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify even further in the future. Barriers-to-entry for large, established Internet companies are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at relatively low cost using commercially available software. While we are currently the market leaders in a number of the markets in which we operate, we currently or potentially compete with a limited number of smaller marketplace operators, such as Alamaula in Argentina and Rakuten in Brazil. We also compete with businesses that offer business-to-consumer online e-commerce services such as pure play Internet retailer Submarino (a website of B2W Inc.), Cnova , Aliexpress or others with a focus on specific vertical categories, such as Netshoes, which focuses on sports &#38; apparel and Dafiti, which focuses on fashion. 

There are also a growing number of brick and mortar retailers who have launched on line offerings such as Americanas (a website of B2W Inc), Cas as Bahia, Wal mart and Falabella, and shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America such as Buscape and Bondfaro. In the classified advertising market we compete with regional players such as OLX and Viva S treet, and with local players such as Webmotors, and Zap, which have strong positions in certain markets. 

In addition, we face competition from a number of large online communities and services that have expertise in either, developing online commerce, facilitating online interaction, or both. Some of these competitors, such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Facebook currently offer a variety of online services, and have the potential to introduce online commerce to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such as large newspaper or media companies, also compete in the online listing market in Latin America. 

In September 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance with eBay, through which eBay became one of our stockholders and started working with us to better serve the Latin American online commerce community. As part of this strategic alliance, we acquired eBay&#8217;s Brazilian subsidiary at the time, iBazar, and eBay agreed not to compete with us in the region during the term of the agreement, which ended on September 24, 2006. This agreement also provided us with access to certain know-how and experience, which accelerated aspects of our development. Even though eBay continues to be one of our stockholders, since the termination of this agreement, there are no contractual restrictions preventing eBay from competing with us. For example, in 2012, eBay acquired Alamaula.com, classifieds site which operates in many of the countries in which we operate. 

MercadoPago competes with existing online and offline means of payment businesses, including, among others, banks and other providers of traditional means of payment, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits, international online payments services such as Paypal and Google Checkout, local online payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash and PagSeguro in Brazil, money remitters such as Western Union, the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America, and offline funding alternatives such as cash deposit and money transfer services. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPago&#8217;s current rates. 

&#160;

Finally, Amazon started operations in Brazil during 2012 by offering on-line content. We do not compete in this space, however the consolidation and expansion of their operations in Brazil could eventually lead to more direct competition. 

Intellectual property 

We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors. We have also established non-disclosure agreements with our employees, strategic partners and some suppliers in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. 

We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Generally, we register the name &#8220;Me rcadoLibre,&#8221; &#8220;MercadoLivre,&#8221; &#8220;MercadoPago&#8221; and &#8220;Mercado Envios &#8221; as well as our handshake logo, and other names and logos in each country where we operate. As part of our acquisition of DeRemate, we acquired the trademarks of DeRemate and CMG, respectively, throughout the countries where they operated as well as certain other jurisdictions. 

Autopark LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our C ompany, has 100% ownership of AP Clasificados which owns trademarks of Autoplaza.com.mx and Homershop.com.mx in Mexico. We wholly-own VMK S.A. (merged with Meli Inversiones SpA since August 2014), Inmobiliaria Web Chile S. de R.L. de C.V. and Inmuebles Online S.A., companies that operate online classified advertisements platforms dedicated to the sale of real estate in Chile through the Portal Inmobiliario brand and in Mexico through the Guia de Inmuebles brand. &#160; Additionally, during 2015, we wholly-own ed interest of Metros C&#250;bicos dedicated to the sale of real estate in Mexico and KPL Solu&#231;&#245;es Ltda., a company that develops ERP software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil. 

We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the &#160; MercadoLibre &#160; brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our pr oprietary rights or reputation. 

Third party technologies 

We also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, such as Oracle Corp., SAP AG, Salesforce.com Inc., Microstrategy, Teradata, Radware, Juniper Networks, Cisco Systems Inc., Arista Networks, Imperva, F5 Networks, and Net A pp, the suppliers of key database technology, the operating system and specific hardware components for our services. 

Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights by allowing sellers to list certain items on MercadoLibre. See &#8220;Item 3. Legal P roceedings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;We could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre Marketplace&#8221; below .

We manage operations in the remaining countries in which we have operations remotely from our headquarters in Argentina. 

Our employees in Brazil are represented by an Information Technology Companies Labor Union in the State of S&#227;o Paulo &#160; (&#8220;Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Empresas e Cursos de Inform&#225;tica do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo&#8221;) &#160; &#160; and some of our employees in Argentina are represented by the Commercial Labor Union (&#8220; Sin dicato de Empleados de Comercio &#8221;) . Unions or local regulations in other countries could also require that employees be represented. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and we implement a variety of human resources practices, programs and policies that are designed to hire, develop, compensate and retain our employees. 

&#160;

We are very proud of our employees and believe that our team is one of the most important assets of our Company. We believe that our employees are among the most knowledgeable in the Latin American Internet industry, and they have developed a deep understanding of our business and e-commerce in general. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining outstanding individuals over the years. A significant portion of our personnel has been with us for several years, and we strive to obtain more talent by hiring individuals with an Internet-related background and experience. Similarly, our future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract, develop and retain capable professionals. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk F actors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212; We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us.&#8221; 

In order to support our Human Resou rces department, we use Success Factors and SAP&#8217;s human resources payroll module across our business. We believe this allows us to centralize our employee database and manage important human resource functions, such as payroll processing (to improve our controls and reduce certain administrative costs), staffing, development and performance management. 

Government regulation 

We are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the countries where we operate related to e-commerce, electronic or mobile payments, data collection, data protection, privacy, information requirements for Internet providers, taxation ( including value added taxes, (&#8220; VAT &#8221;) or sales tax collection obligations) obligations to provide information to certain authorities about transac tions occurring on our platform or about our users, and other legislation which also applies to other companies conducting business in general. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation (including the imposition to provide certain information about transactions that occurred on our platform, or about our users), libel and defamation, obscenity, consumer protection, digital signatures and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Some of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These regulations could cover a wide variety of issues, including, without limitation, online commerce, Internet service providers&#8217; responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, electronic or mobile payments, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligation to provide certain information about transactions that occurred through our platform, or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection and information security. 

We are also subject to regulations in Argentina that impose sales taxes and VAT collection obligations on the Company based on users&#8217; sales through the platform. Other jurisdictions may issue new legislation in that regard. If users were to reduce or stop using our website or services as a result of these regulations, our business would be harmed. 

In Brazil, since the approval of the Law No. 12,865 on October 9, 2013 and certain rules issued by the Brazilian Central Bank in November 2013, we are subject to new obligations imposed on certain payment processing functions carried out by non-financial institutions. During December 2014, we submitted to the Brazilian Central Bank our application to become an authorized payment institution in Brazil. As of the date of this report, we have not received such authorization. 

These regulations cover a wide variety of issues, including, among other things: rules related to the requirement to obtain Brazilian Central Bank authorization to operate, offering or providing those services, penalties for non-compliance, the promotion of financial inclusion, the reduction of systemic, operational and credit risks, reporting obligations and governance. 

In October 2014, Colombia enacted the Law No. 1,735 which creates a special financial institution to provide certain payment services and covers a wide variety of issues, including, among other things: rules related to the requirement to obtain authorization from the Colombian &#160; Superintendencia Financiera (Financial Supervision Authority) &#160; to operate, offer or provide certain payment services, penalties for non-compliance, the promotion of financial inclusion, reporting obligations and governance. In 2015 the Law No. 1,735 was regulated by Decree 1491 of 2015, which established specific requirements to open accounts, and policies for cash and risk management. 

Uruguay and Peru recently enacted regulations that cover a wide variety of issues related to electronic payments or e-money, including, among other things: rules related to the requirement to obtain authorization from the relevant authority to operate, offer or provide certain payment services, penalties for non-compliance, reporting obligations and governance. &#160; 

In the rest of the countries in which we operate &#160; we believe that the agency-based structure that we currently use for MercadoPago allows us to operate this service without obtaining any governmental authorizations or licenses or being regulated as a financial institution in the countries where we offer MercadoPago. However, as we continue to develop MercadoPago, we may need to secure governmental authorizations or licenses or comply with regulations applicable to financial institutions, electronic or mobile payments and/or anti-money laundering in the countries where we offer this service. 

There are laws and regulations that address foreign currency and exchange rates in every country in which we operate. In certain countries where we operate, we need governmental authorization to pay invoices to a foreign supplier or send money abroad due to foreign exchange 

&#160;

restricti ons. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk f actors&#8212;Risks related to doing business in Latin America&#8212;Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls&#8221; for more information. 

On May 15, 2007, the Argentine Ministry of Economy approved MercadoLibre S.A. (this subsidiary changed its legal name in 2010 to MercadoLibre S.R.L.), our wholly owned Argentine subsidiary, as a beneficiary of the Argentine Regime to promote the software industry. Benefits of receiving this status included a 70% discount on mandatory Argentine labor taxes, a 60% reduction of Argentine income tax payable and a fixed federal tax rate in Argentina until September 2014. 

On August 17, 2011, the Argentine government issued a new software development law and on September 9, 2013, the regulatory decree for this new law was issued, which established new requirements to become a beneficiary of the new software development law. The decree established compliance requirements with annual incremental ratios related to exports of services and research and development expenses that must be achieved to qualify for relief under the new software development law. To be a beneficiary of the new software development law, our Argentine subsidiary will have to achieve certain required ratios annually under the new software development law. 

The Industry Secretary resolution which rules, among other provisions, on the mechanism to file the information to obtain the benefits derived from the new software development law was issued in late February 2014. During May 2014, the Company presented all the required documentation in order to apply for the new software development law. 

On September 17, 2015, the Argentine Industry Secretary issued Resolution 1041/2015 approving the Company&#8217;s application for eligibility under the new software development law. As a result, the Company&#8217;s Argentinean subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday retroactive from September 18, 2014. A portion of the benefits obtained as beneficiaries of the new law is a relief of 60% of total income tax related to software development activities and a 70% relief in payroll taxes related to software development activities. 

The new software development law, which provides that beneficiaries must meet certain on-going eligibility requirements, will expire on December 31, 2019. As a result of our eligibility u nder the new law, we recorded an income tax benefit of &#160;$24. 6 million during 2015, corresponding $21.0 million to the income tax benefit of the year 2015 and $3. 6 million of the fourth quarter of 2014. Furthermore, we recorded a labor cost benefit of $5.2 million, corresponding $3.9 million to the labor cost benefit of the year 2015 and $1.3 million of the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, $ 2 . 0 million were reserved to pay softw are development law audit fees. 

Finally, the Venezuelan Gover n ment issued a decree of Fair Prices that was published in the Official Gazette N&#176; 40,787 dated November 12, 2015 which establishes a maximum profit margin of 30% of the cost structure of good or service sold in each participant in the commercialization chain. The Decree expresses that its purpose is to assure the development of the national economy by determining fair prices of goods and services, profit margins, commercialization mechanisms, and control to be exercised in order to assure access by the individuals to goods and services at fair prices. The determination, modification, and control of prices is under the competence of the Executive which will be exercised through the National Superintendence for Defense of Socioeconomic Rights (SUNDDE). 

The Decree establishes different penalties ranging between 2 and 18 years of imprisonment, or expropriation, adoption of measures as temporary occupation and/or seizure of goods. The Decree also imposes fines ranging from 200 Tax Units to 50,000 Tax Units; temporarily suspend the Single Registry of Persons that Develop Economic Activities (RUPDAE) from 3 months to 10 years; issue measures of temporary occupation with intervention of warehouses, storehouses, industries, commercial establishments, transport of goods, for up to 180 days; temporarily shut down warehouses, storehouses or establishments engaged in the commerce, preservation, storage, production, or processing of goods for up to 180 days, or closure, or confiscation of goods among other measures. The Decree also establishes penalties up to 20% of the annual net income of the infringer. The Decree also establishes that directors, partners, representatives, managers, supervisors and administrators will be jointly and severally liable (civil, criminal or administrative) with the company found in violation of the Decree. 

Our Management is analyzing the potential effects of this law together with the new implementation Decree issued by the Venezuelan Government.
