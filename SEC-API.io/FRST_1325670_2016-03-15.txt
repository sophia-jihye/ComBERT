Overview 

&#160;

Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (&#8220;Southern National&#8221;, &#8220;SNBV&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is the bank holding company for Sonabank (&#8220;Sonabank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) a Virginia state chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Sonabank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium sized businesses. Sonabank has fifteen branches in Virginia, located in Fairfax County (Reston, McLean and Fairfax), in Charlottesville, Warrenton (2), Middleburg, Leesburg (2), South Riding, Front Royal, New Market, Haymarket, Richmond and Clifton Forge, and eight branches in Maryland, in Rockville, Shady Grove, Frederick, Bethesda, Upper Marlboro, Brandywine, Owings and Huntingtown. As of December 31, 2015, we reported, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $1.0 billion, total loans, net of deferred fees, of $829.4 million, total deposits of $825.3 million and shareholders&#8217; equity of $119.6 million.

&#160;

While we offer a wide range of commercial banking services, we focus on making loans secured primarily by commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes. We are a leading Small Business Administration (SBA) lender among Virginia community banks. We also invest in real estate-related securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. We offer a broad range of deposit products, including checking (NOW), savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We actively pursue business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of our senior management, other bank officers and our directors, thereby capitalizing on our knowledge of our local market areas .

&#160;

Effective December 4, 2009, Sonabank assumed certain deposits and liabilities and acquired certain assets of Greater Atlantic Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Greater Atlantic Bank, pursuant to the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement entered into by the Bank and the FDIC on December 4, 2009 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). On December 5, 2009, the former Greater Atlantic Bank offices, located in Reston, New Market, Front Royal and South Riding, Virginia and Rockville, Maryland opened as Sonabank branches.

&#160;

Covered loan losses are reimbursed in accordance with the FDIC loss sharing agreements. There are two agreements with the FDIC, one for single family assets which is a 10 year agreement expiring in December 2019, and one for non-single family (commercial) assets which was a 5 year agreement that expired in December 2014. Our FDIC indemnification asset, the estimate of the expected loss amounts to be reimbursed by the FDIC has a current carrying value of $2.9 million and an estimated fair value of $745 thousand reflecting an overstated FDIC indemnification asset. This current overstatement, which is due to improvements in the loss estimates in the single family covered loans, is being amortized down in accordance with accounting rules over the life of the contract (10 years for single family covered assets) or the life of the loans, whichever is shorter.

&#160;

On October 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of the Midlothian branch of the Bank of Hampton Roads in Richmond, Virginia. We assumed deposits in the amount of $42.2 million.

&#160;

Effective April 27, 2012, Sonabank assumed substantially all of the deposits and liabilities and acquired substantially all of the assets of the HarVest Bank of Maryland from the FDIC as receiver. The acquisition included HarVest Bank&#8217;s branches in Bethesda, North Rockville, Germantown and Frederick, Maryland. Adding these new branches to our existing branch in Rockville brought Sonabank&#8217;s total number of branches in Maryland to five, four of which are in Montgomery County. This was a strategic acquisition for Sonabank in order to expand into an affluent market.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The merger with Prince George&#8217;s Federal Savings Bank (PGFSB) was completed on August 1, 2014. Southern National acquired PGFSB in a cash and stock transaction. PGFSB was founded in 1931 and is headquartered in Upper Marlboro, which is the County Seat of Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. PGFSB has four offices, all of which are in Maryland, including a main office in Upper Marlboro and three branch offices in Dunkirk, Brandywine and Huntingtown. PGFSB has an excellent core deposit base reflecting its tenure in the communities it serves, and its lending activities have historically been focused on residential mortgages.

&#160;

Full details on each of these acquisitions are contained in Form 8-Ks or 8-K/As filed with the SEC on December 10, 2009, October 4, 2011, July 13, 2012, and August 5, 2014, respectively.

&#160;

On May 15, 2014, Southern National Bancorp of Virginia Inc., Jerry Flowers of Southern Trust Mortgage (STM), and Eastern Virginia Bankshares (EVB), the holding company for EVB, completed the purchase of 62 percent of STM previously owned by Middleburg Bank. Jerry Flowers and other STM executives now own 51.1 percent of STM, Sonabank owns 44 percent and EVB owns 4.9 percent.

&#160;

Sonabank&#8217;s equity method investment in STM totaled $3.2 million. Sonabank also acquired 1.8 million shares of preferred stock in the amount of $1.8 million in STM with an annual dividend yield of 7.5%. In June 2015, Sonabank acquired additional shares of preferred stock in the amount of $750 thousand.

&#160;

We primarily market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and to retail consumers. Our strategy is to provide superior service through our employees, who are relationship-oriented and committed to their respective customers. Through this strategy, we intend to grow our business, expand our customer base and improve our profitability. The key elements of our strategy are to:

&#160;

&#183; Utilize the Strength of our Management Team . The experience and market knowledge of our management team is one of our greatest strengths and competitive advantages. Our chairman, Georgia S. Derrico, was the founder, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and our president, R. Roderick Porter, was the president and chief operating officer, of Southern Financial Bancorp, Inc., a publicly traded bank holding company. At the time of its sale to Provident Bankshares, Inc. in April of 2004, Southern Financial had $1.5 billion in assets and operated 34 full-service banking offices of Southern Financial Bank, which was founded in Fairfax County and subsequently expanded into Central and Southern Virginia. Including the members of our current senior management team, 35 of our employees previously worked with our chairman and president at Southern Financial Bank. &#183; Leverage Our Existing Foundation for Additional Growth. Based on our management&#8217;s depth of experience and certain infrastructure investments, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of certain economies of scale typically enjoyed by larger organizations to expand our operations both organically and through strategic cost-effective branch or bank acquisitions. We believe that the investments we have made in our data processing, risk management infrastructure, staff and branch network will be able to support a much larger asset base. We are committed, however, to control any additional growth in a manner designed to minimize the risk and to maintain strong capital ratios. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Continue to Pursue Selective Acquisition Opportunities . Historically, acquisitions have been a key part of our growth. Since our formation, we have completed the acquisition of PGFSB, the acquisition of HarVest Bank of Maryland on April 27, 2012, the acquisition of the Midlothian branch in Richmond, Virginia on October 1, 2011, the acquisition and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of Greater Atlantic Bank from the FDIC on December 4, 2009, the acquisition of a branch of Millennium Bank in Warrenton, Virginia on September 28, 2009, the acquisition of the Leesburg branch location from Founders Corporation which opened on February 11, 2008, the acquisition of 1 st Service Bank in December of 2006 and the acquisition of the Clifton Forge branch of First Community Bancorp, Inc. in December of 2005. We intend to continue to review branch and whole bank acquisition opportunities, including possible acquisitions of failed financial institutions in FDIC -assisted transactions, and will pursue these opportunities if they represent the most efficient use of our capital under the circumstances. We believe that we have demonstrated the skill sets and experience necessary to acquire and integrate successfully both bank and branch acquisitions, and that with our strong capital position, we are well-positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they may arise. We intend to focus on targets in our market areas or other attractive areas with significant core deposits and/or a potential customer base compatible with our growth strategy. &#183; De novo Branch Expansion . In addition to our acquisition strategy, we plan to open de novo branches from time to time to fill in our existing footprint as we did in Middleburg in 2011 and Haymarket in 2012. &#183; Focus on the Business Owner . It is our goal to be the bank that business owners in our markets turn to first for commercial banking needs as a result of our superior personal service and the tailored products and services that we provide. To help achieve this goal, we: &#167; have a standing credit committee that meets as often as necessary on a &#8220;when needed&#8221; basis to review completed loan applications, making extensive use of technology to facilitate our internal communications and thereby enabling us to respond to our customers promptly; &#167; are an SBA approved &#8220;Preferred&#8221; lender, which permits us to make SBA loan decisions at Sonabank rather than waiting for SBA processing. We offer a number of different types of SBA loans designed for the small and medium-sized business owner and many of our SBA loan customers also have other relationships with Sonabank. This product group is complex and &#8220;paper intensive&#8221; and not well utilized by some of our competitors; &#167; provide Internet business banking at www.sonabank.com which allows our business customers 24-hour web-based access to their accounts so they can confirm or transfer balances, pay bills, download statements and use our &#8220;Web Lockbox&#8221; or &#8220;Sona Cash Manager;&#8221; &#167; provide our business customers with &#8220;Sona In-House,&#8221; a service that utilizes Check 21 technology to allow customers to make remote deposits from their business locations and gives them access to those funds within 24 to 48 hours; and &#167; provide our business customers with access to SABL, our state-of-the-art asset-based lending system. Unlike most asset-based lending systems, which are based on manual processes or software that certifies a company&#8217;s borrowing base periodically, SABL provides a real time capability to analyze and adjust borrowing availability based on actual collateral levels. SABL is predicated on a link between any kind of accounting software used by the customer and Sonabank&#8217;s server. &#183; Maintain Local Decision-Making and Accountability . We believe that we have a competitive advantage over larger national and regional financial institutions by providing superior customer service with experienced, knowledgeable management, localized decision-making capabilities and prompt credit decisions. We believe that our customers want to deal directly with the persons who make the credit decisions. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Focus on Asset Quality and Strong Underwriting . We consider asset quality to be of primary importance and have taken measures in an effort to ensure that, despite the growth in our loan portfolio, we maintain strong asset quality through strong underwriting standards. &#183; Build a Stable Core Deposit Base . We intend to continue to grow a stable core deposit base of business and retail customers. To the extent that our asset growth outpaces this local deposit funding source, we plan to continue to borrow and raise deposits in the national market using deposit intermediaries. We intend to continue our practice of developing a deposit relationship with each of our loan customers. &#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our principal business is the acquisition of deposits from the general public through our branch offices and deposit intermediaries and the use of these deposits to fund our loan and investment portfolios. We seek to be a full service community bank that provides a wide variety of financial services to our middle market corporate clients as well as to our retail clients. We are an active commercial lender, have been designated as a &#8220;Preferred SBA Lender&#8221; and participate in the Virginia Small Business Financing Authority lending program. In addition, we are an active commercial real estate lender. We also invest funds in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, securities issued by agencies of the federal government, obligations of states and political subdivisions and pooled trust preferred securities.

&#160;

The principal sources of funds for our lending and investment activities are deposits, repayment of loans, prepayments from mortgage-backed securities, repayments of maturing investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowed money.

&#160;

Principal sources of revenue are interest and fees on loans and investment securities, as well as fee income derived from the maintenance of deposit accounts and income from bank-owned life insurance policies. Our principal expenses include interest paid on deposits and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) and other borrowings, and operating expenses.

&#160; 

Available Information 

&#160;

Southern National files annual, quarterly and other reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with the SEC. These reports are posted and are available at no cost on our website, www.sonabank.com , through the Investor Relations link, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such documents with the SEC. Our filings are also available through the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov.

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160;

Our primary strategic objective is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market with a variety of unique and useful services, including a full array of commercial mortgage and non-mortgage loans. These loans include commercial real estate loans, construction to permanent loans, development and builder loans, accounts receivable financing, lines of credit, equipment and vehicle loans, leasing, and commercial overdraft protection. We strive to do business in the areas served by our branches, which is also where our marketing is focused, and the vast majority of our loan customers are located in existing market areas. Virtually all of our loans are with borrowers in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, or Washington D.C. The Small Business Administration may from time to time come to us because of our reputation and expertise as an SBA lender and ask us to review a loan outside of our core counties but within our market area. Prior to making a loan, we obtain loan applications to determine a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The following is a discussion of each of the major types of lending. For more information on our lending activities, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition.&#8221;

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Lending 

&#160; 

Permanent. Commercial real estate lending includes loans for permanent financing. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. As a general practice, we require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by well-managed income producing properties with adequate margins and to be guaranteed by responsible parties. We look for opportunities where cash flow from the collateral properties provides adequate debt service coverage and the guarantor&#8217;s net worth is strong. At December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate loans for permanent financing including multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland totaled $424.1 million, of which $12.9 million was acquired in the HarVest transaction, $5.3 million was acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction, and $3.2 million was acquired in the PGFSB transaction. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $141.5 million.

&#160;

Our underwriting guidelines for commercial real estate loans reflect all relevant credit factors, including, among other things, the income generated from the underlying property to adequately service the debt, the availability of secondary sources of repayment and the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. In addition, we look to the value of the collateral, while maintaining the level of equity invested by the borrower.

&#160;

All valuations on property which will secure loans over $250 thousand are performed by independent outside appraisers who are reviewed by our executive vice president of risk management and/or our appraisal reviewer. We retain a valid lien on real estate and obtain a title insurance policy (on first trust loans only) that insures the property is free of encumbrances. In addition, we do title searches on all loans secured by real estate.

&#160;

Construction. We recognize that construction loans for commercial, multifamily and other non-residential properties can involve risk due to the length of time it may take to bring a finished real estate product to market. As a result, we will only make these types of loans when pre-leasing or pre-sales or other credit factors suggest that the borrower can carry the debt if the anticipated market and property cash flow projections change during the construction phase.

&#160;

Income producing property loans are supported by evidence of the borrower&#8217;s capacity to service the debt. All of our commercial construction loans are guaranteed by the principals or general partners. At December 31, 2015, we had $67.8 million of construction, land and development loans, of which $3.7 million was acquired in the HarVest transaction and $1.3 million was acquired in the PGFSB transaction.

&#160;

Construction loan borrowers are generally pre-qualified for the permanent loan by us or a third party. We obtain a copy of the contract with the general contractor who must be acceptable to us. All plans, specifications and surveys must include proposed improvements. We review feasibility studies and risk analyses showing sensitivity of the project to variables such as interest rates, vacancy rates, lease rates and operating expenses.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Commercial Business Lending 

&#160; 

These loans consist of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. Commercial business loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and other collateral, such as readily marketable stocks and bonds with adequate margins, cash value in life insurance policies and savings and time deposits at Sonabank. At December 31, 2015, our commercial business loans totaled $125.0 million, of which $2.7 million was acquired in the HarVest transaction, $511 thousand was acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction and $174 thousand was acquired in the PGFSB transaction.

&#160;

In general, commercial business loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and real estate-backed commercial loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return to us. The increased risk for commercial business loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans. The increased risk also derives from the expectation that commercial loans will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and that those operations may not be successful. Historical trends have shown that these types of loans do have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. Because of this, we often utilize the SBA 7(a) program (which guarantees the repayment of up to 90% of the principal and accrued interest to us) to reduce the inherent risk associated with commercial business lending.

&#160;

Another way that we reduce risk in the commercial loan portfolio is by taking accounts receivable as collateral using our SABL system. Our accounts receivable financing facilities, which provide a relatively high yield with considerable collateral control, are lines of credit under which a company can borrow up to the amount of a borrowing base which covers a certain percentage of the company&#8217;s receivables. From our customer&#8217;s point of view, accounts receivable financing is an efficient way to finance expanding operations because borrowing capacity expands as sales increase. Customers can borrow from 75% to 90% of qualified receivables. In most cases, the borrower&#8217;s customers pay us directly. For borrowers with a good track record for earnings and quality receivables, we will consider pricing based on an increment above the prime rate for transactions in which we lend up to a percentage of qualified outstanding receivables based on reported aging of the receivables portfolio.

&#160;

We also actively pursue for our customers equipment lease financing opportunities. We provide financing and use a third party to service the leases. Payment is derived from the cash flow of the borrower, so credit quality may not be any lower than it would be in the case of an unsecured loan for a similar amount and term.

&#160;

SBA Lending 

&#160; 

We have developed an expertise in the federally guaranteed SBA program. The SBA program is an economic development program which finances the expansion of small businesses. We are a Preferred Lender in the Washington D.C. and Richmond Districts of the SBA. As an SBA Preferred Lender, our pre-approved status allows us to quickly respond to customers&#8217; needs. Under the SBA program, we originate and fund SBA 7(a) loans which qualify for guarantees up to 90% of principal and accrued interest. We also originate 504 chapter loans in which we generally provide 50% of the financing, taking a first lien on the real property as collateral.

&#160;

We provide SBA loans to potential borrowers who are proposing a business venture, often with existing cash flow and a reasonable chance of success. We do not treat the SBA guarantee as a substitute for a borrower meeting our credit standards, and, except for minimum capital levels or maximum loan terms, the borrower must meet our other credit standards as applicable to loans outside the SBA process.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Lending 

&#160; 

Permanent. Our business model generally does not include originating permanent residential mortgage loans. We do it only on a case-by-case basis. In the case of conventional loans, we typically lend up to 80% of the appraised value of single-family residences and require mortgage insurance for loans exceeding that amount. We have no sub-prime loans.

&#160;

On May 15, 2014, we purchased a 44% equity investment and preferred stock of STM, a regional mortgage banking company headquartered in Virginia Beach. STM has mortgage banking originators in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. Southern Trust Mortgage only originates retail mortgage production.

&#160;

Sonabank has established with STM underwriting guidelines under which it will purchase residential construction only, construction loans that convert to permanent, and permanent loans primarily in its Virginia and Maryland footprint from STM. These will be largely loans that do not conform to FNMA or FHLMC standards because of size or acreage. We purchased loans in an aggregate amount of $51.4 million during 2015, $4.8 million of which were construction or construction permanent loans.

&#160;

We retain a valid lien on real estate and obtain a title insurance policy that ensures that the property is free of encumbrances. We also require hazard insurance and flood insurance for all loans secured by real property if the real property is in a flood plain as designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We also require most borrowers to advance funds on a monthly basis from which we make disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, private mortgage insurance and hazard insurance.

&#160;

Home Equity Lines of Credit. Sonabank rarely originates home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding balances totaling $35.2 million, of which $21.4 million were acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction, $578 thousand were acquired in the HarVest transaction and $3.0 million were acquired in the PGFSB transaction.

&#160;

Consumer Lending 

&#160; 

To a limited extent, we offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. We make consumer loans primarily for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base since these loans are not the focus of our lending activities. As a general guideline, a consumer&#8217;s debt service should not exceed 40% of his gross income or 45% of net income. For purposes of this calculation, debt includes house payment or rent, fixed installment payments, the estimated payment for the loan being requested and the minimum required payment on any revolving debt. At December 31, 2015, we had $1.4 million of consumer loans outstanding.

&#160;

Credit Approval and Collection Policies 

&#160; 

Because future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what management believes is a stringent loan underwriting policy. Our underwriting guidelines are tailored for particular credit types, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, real estate loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We will make extensions of credit based, among other factors, on the potential borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness, likelihood of repayment and proximity to market areas served.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have a standing Credit Committee comprised of certain officers, each of whom has a defined lending authority in combination with other officers. These individual lending authorities are determined by our Chief Executive Officer and certain directors and are based on the individual&#8217;s technical ability and experience. These authorities must be approved by our board of directors and our Credit Committee. Our Credit Committee is comprised of four levels of members: junior, regular, senior, and executive, based on experience. Our executive members are Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker. Mr. Stevens, Chief Risk Officer, must approve risk ratings for loans over $1.5 million, as well as exceptions to the Credit Policy. Loans over a certain size must be approved by the full Board of Directors or the Credit Committee plus two outside directors. Under our loan approval process, the sponsoring loan officer&#8217;s approval is required on all credit submissions. This approval must be included in or added to the individual and joining authorities outlined below. The sponsoring loan officer is primarily responsible for the customer&#8217;s relationship with us, including, among other things, obtaining and maintaining adequate credit file information. We require each loan officer to maintain loan files in an order and detail that would enable a disinterested third party to review the file and determine the current status and quality of the credit.

&#160;

In addition to the approval of the sponsoring loan officer, we require approvals from one or more members of the Credit Committee on all loans. The approvals required differ based on the size of the borrowing relationship. At least one senior or one executive member must approve all loans in the amount of $100,000 or more. All three of the executive members of the committee must approve all loans of $1 million or more. Regardless of the number of approvals needed, we encourage each member not to rely on another member&#8217;s approval as a basis for approval and to treat his approval as if it were the only approval necessary to approve the loan. Our legal lending limit to one borrower is limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus. As of December 31, 2015, our legal lending limit was approximately $17.5 million. Our largest group credit as of December 31, 2015, was approximately $17.2 million.

&#160;

The following collection actions are the minimal procedures which management believes are necessary to properly monitor past due loans and leases. When a borrower fails to make a payment, we contact the borrower in person, in writing or on the telephone. At a minimum, all borrowers are notified by mail when payments of principal and/or interest are 10 days past due. Real estate and commercial loan borrowers are assessed a late charge when payments are 10-15 days past due. Customers are contacted by a loan officer before the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. After 90 days, if the loan has not been brought current or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower, we will institute measures to remedy the default, including commencing foreclosure action with respect to mortgage loans and repossessions of collateral in the case of consumer loans.

&#160;

If foreclosure is effected, the property is sold at a public auction in which we may participate as a bidder. If we are the successful bidder, we include the acquired real estate property in our real estate owned account until it is sold. These assets are initially recorded at fair value net of estimated selling costs. To the extent there is a subsequent decline in fair value, that amount is charged to operating expense. At December 31, 2015, we had other real estate owned totaling $10.4 million, of which $581 thousand, net of discount, resulted from foreclosures on loans that were acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction.

&#160; 

Special Products and Services 

&#160; 

To complement our array of loans, we also provide the following special products and services to our commercial customers:

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Cash Management Services 

&#160;

Cash Management services are offered that enable the Bank&#8217;s business customers to maximize the efficiency of their cash management. Specific products offered in our cash management services program include the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Investment/sweep accounts &#8226; Wire Transfer services &#8226; Employer Services/Payroll processing services &#8226; Zero balance accounts &#8226; Night depository services &#8226; Lockbox services &#8226; Depository transfers &#8226; Merchant services (third party) &#8226; ACH originations &#8226; Business debit cards &#8226; Controlled disbursement accounts &#8226; SONA 24/7 (Check 21 processing) &#8226; Sonabank asset based lending (SABL) &#8226; Mobiliti, a mobile banking application for personal and business accounts &#160;

Some of the products listed above are described in-depth below.

&#160;

&#8226; SONA 24/7/Check 21: SONA 24/7 is ideal for landlords, property managers, medical professionals, and any other businesses that accept checks. Now the customers of Sonabank can have total control over how, when, and where their checks will be deposited. SONA 24/7 uses the Check Truncation technology outlined by the &#8220;Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act&#8221;, passed in October 2004 (Check 21). With Check Truncation, paper checks can now be converted to electronic images and processed between participating banks, vastly speeding up the check clearing process. SONA In-House passes on the benefits of Check Truncation directly to Sonabank&#8217;s business customers.

&#160;

&#8226; Lockbox Services: Sonabank will open a lockbox, retrieve and scan incoming checks, and deposit them directly into the customer&#8217;s account. The images of the checks will then be available to view online. This makes bookkeeping for the customer fast and easy, and because Sonabank is checking the lockbox daily, funds will often be available sooner. Big businesses have been using lockboxes for decades as a cash management tool. Sonabank makes this service cost effective for all small and medium sized businesses as well.

&#160;

&#8226; Employer Services: Sonabank will provide its business clients with software that allows them to generate ACH payroll transactions to their employees&#8217; accounts.

&#160;

&#8226; SABL: Asset Based Lending is a form of &#8220;collateral-based&#8221; lending. It is a combination of secured lending and short-term business lending. It is a specialized form of financing that allows a bank&#8217;s commercial customers to pledge their working assets, typically accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, inventory, as collateral to secure financing. Asset Based Lending borrowers are typically in the service, manufacturing or distribution fields. 

&#160;

SABL is an Asset Based Lending software system built by Sonabank that allows the bank to monitor the collateral of its commercial borrowers who have pledged their working assets (accounts receivables and other qualifying assets such as inventory) as collateral. SABL has the ability to track other offsets (liabilities, e.g. other loans the customer has with the bank) to the line of credit. SABL serves to provide the more stringent controls and supervision that this type of lending requires.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

One control that is typical of Asset Based Lending is that the commercial borrower is required to have its customers remit invoice payments to a bank controlled lockbox. The bank retrieves these payments and the bank applies them directly to any outstanding balance on the line. SABL allows for this and can combine that service with remote capture (Check 21) if warranted.

&#160;

Most Asset Based Lending systems are manual processes or software that certifies the borrowing base periodically. These certifications are usually provided in the form of manually created borrowing bases backed up with field exams. SABL provides a real time capability to analyze and adjust borrowing availability based on the levels of collateral at the moment.

&#160;

SABL also offers an automated collateral upload, taking receivable information directly from the clients accounting system. SABL also offers discretionary borrowings and pay offs, allowing clients to borrow on or pay down their line at their discretion, as long as they are compliant with the SABL system. Lastly, SABL offers superior reporting, offering reports to bank officers that provide all the information they need to monitor risk. Customized reports can also be built for clients.

Competition 

&#160; 

The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete in the market areas in which our banking operations are located. We experience substantial competition in attracting and retaining savings deposits and in lending funds. The primary factors we encounter in competing for savings deposits are convenient office locations and rates offered. Direct competition for savings deposits comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities which may offer more attractive rates than insured depository institutions are willing to pay. The primary factors we encounter in competing for loans include, among others, interest rate and loan origination fees and the range of services offered. Competition for origination of loans normally comes from other commercial banks, thrift institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and insurance companies. We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by:

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; emphasizing customer service and technology; &#8226; establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty; and &#8226; providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers. &#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 181 full-time equivalent employees, five of whom were executive officers. Management considers its relations with its employees to be good. Neither we nor Sonabank are a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160;

The business of Southern National and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state banking laws and other federal and state laws and regulations, including primary oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and secondary oversight by the Bureau of Financial Institutions, a regulatory division of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (&#8220;VBFI&#8221;) , and possibly other authorities. In general, these laws and regulations are intended for the protection of the customers and depositors of the Bank and not for the protection of Southern National or its shareholders. Set forth below are brief descriptions of selected laws and regulations applicable to Southern National and the Bank. These descriptions are not intended to be a comprehensive description of all laws and regulations to which Southern National and the Bank are subject or to be complete descriptions of the laws and regulations discussed. The descriptions of statutory and regulatory provisions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutes and regulations.

&#160;

The earnings of the Bank and therefore of Southern National are affected by general economic conditions, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referenced above. Additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels. The regulatory framework under which we operate has and will continue to change substantially over the next several years as the result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on Southern National, the Bank and their business.

&#160;

Federal Reserve Board Oversight, including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) and required to file periodic reports regarding our operations and any additional information that the FRB may require. Our activities at the bank holding company level are limited to:

&#160;

&#8226; banking, managing or controlling banks; &#8226; furnishing services to or performing services for our bank subsidiary; and &#8226; engaging in other activities that the FRB has determined by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to these activities. &#160;

Some of the activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be proper incidents to the business of a bank holding company include making or servicing loans and specific types of leases, performing specific data processing services and acting in some circumstances as a fiduciary or investment or financial adviser. Southern National does not currently plan to perform any of these activities, but may do so in the future.

&#160;

With some limited exceptions, the BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before: (i) acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank; (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the FRB is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and various competitive factors.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, and subject to some exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with their regulations, require FRB approval prior to any person or company acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more, of any class of voting securities and either has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging this rebuttable control presumption. On September 22, 2008, the FRB issued a policy statement on equity investments in bank holding companies and banks, which allows the FRB to generally be able to conclude that an entity's investment is not &#8220;controlling&#8221; if the entity does not own in excess of 15% of the voting power and 33% of the total equity of the bank holding company or bank. Depending on the nature of the overall investment and the capital structure of the banking organization, based on the policy statement, the FRB will permit noncontrolling investments in the form of voting and nonvoting shares that represent in the aggregate (i) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (ii) less than 15% of any class of voting securities of the banking organization.

&#160;

In November 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), which made substantial revisions to the statutory restrictions separating banking activities from other financial activities. Under the GLBA, bank holding companies that are well-capitalized under the prompt-corrective-action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) and well-managed under applicable FRB regulations and meet other conditions can elect to become &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; and engage in certain activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company. As financial holding companies, they and their subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in previously impermissible activities such as insurance underwriting, securities underwriting and distribution, travel agency activities, insurance agency activities, merchant banking and other activities that the FRB determines to be financial in nature or complementary to these activities. Although Southern National has not elected to become a financial holding company in order to exercise the broader activity powers provided by the GLBA, we may elect to do so in the future.

&#160;

In addition, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is also subject to primary federal oversight by the FRB, as well as secondary oversight by the VBFI and the Bureau. Notably, the discussions below are relevant to both Southern National and the Bank.

&#160;

Bank Permitted Activities and Investments . The activities and investments of state member banks are generally limited to those permissible under applicable state law. In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), a state member bank may not engage in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the appropriate bank regulator determines that the activity does not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) and that the bank meets its minimum capital requirements.

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory reform legislation, which the President signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector, including provisions that, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; Created a new regulatory authority, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;Bureau&#8221;), responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws; &#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Established new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital; &#160;

&#183; Broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average total consolidated assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period; &#160;

&#183; Permanently increased FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000; &#160;

&#183; Permitted banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state; &#160;

&#183; Repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; &#160;

&#183; Required financial holding companies to be well capitalized and well managed as of July 21, 2011. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state; &#160;

&#183; Eliminated the ceiling on the size of the DIF and increased the floor of the size of the DIF; &#160;

&#183; Added new limitations on federal preemption; &#160;

&#183; Imposed new prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity to engage in proprietary trading for its own account and have certain interests in, or relationships with, certain unregistered hedge funds, private equity funds and commodity pools (together, &#8220;covered funds&#8221;); &#160;

&#183; Required that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities; &#160;

&#183; Required banking regulators to remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness; &#160;

&#183; Implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions; &#160;

&#183; Amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act which, among other things, gave the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer; and &#160;

&#183; Increased the authority of the FRB to examine us and our non-bank subsidiaries. &#160;

As stated above, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau, a new federal regulatory body with broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The authority of the Bureau to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions&#8217; primary regulators. However, the Bureau may participate in examinations of institutions with $10 billion or less in assets on a &#8220;sampling basis&#8221; and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. Accordingly, the Bureau may participate in examinations of the Bank, and could supervise and examine other direct or indirect subsidiaries of Southern National that offer consumer financial products.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Some of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices, or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. While many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others will continue to be implemented over time. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on our businesses or ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. The FDIC maintains the DIF by designating a required reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio falls below the designated level, the FDIC must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the DIF will return to an acceptable level generally within 5 years. The DIF reserve ratio is maintained by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium based upon statutory factors, including the degree of risk the institution poses to the DIF.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the statutory regime governing the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established a minimum designated reserve ratio (&#8220;DRR&#8221;) of 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits, required that the fund reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020 and directed the FDIC to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk-based assessment system found in the FDIA.

&#160;

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that amended its existing DIF restoration plan and implemented certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. This rule, which took effect April 1, 2011, changed the FDIC&#8217;s assessment system from one based on domestic deposits to one based on the average consolidated total assets of a bank minus its average tangible equity during each quarter. Under the February 7, 2011 final rule, the total base assessment rates will vary depending on the DIF reserve ratio. For example, for banks in the best risk category, the total base assessment rate will be between 2.5 and 9 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is below 1.15 percent, between 1.5 and 7 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is between 1.15 percent and 2 percent, between 1 and 6 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is between 2 percent and 2.5 percent and between 0.5 and 5 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is 2.5 percent or higher.

&#160; 

Safety and Soundness . There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the DIF in the event that the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. These obligations and restrictions are not for the benefit of investors. The FRB's Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the FRB prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the holding company's consolidated net worth. The FRB may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the FRB could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Regulators may pursue an administrative action against any bank holding company or state member bank which violates the law, engages in an unsafe or unsound banking practice or which is about to engage in an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The administrative action could take the form of a cease and desist proceeding, a removal action against the responsible individuals or, in the case of a violation of law or unsafe and unsound banking practice, a civil penalty action. A cease and desist order, in addition to prohibiting certain action, could also require that certain action be undertaken. Under the policies of the FRB, Southern National is required to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where Southern National might not do so otherwise. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s new provisions authorize the FRB to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; obligations and to enforce the company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. The FRB and other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing this requirement, though it is understood that regulators are engaged in a joint effort to produce these rules.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy Requirements . The regulatory capital framework has recently changed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate, international capital initiative known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Regulators recently issued rules implementing these requirements (&#8220;Revised Capital Rules&#8221;). Among other things, the Revised Capital Rules raise the minimum thresholds for required capital and revise certain aspects of the definitions and elements of the capital that can be used to satisfy these required minimum thresholds. While the rules became effective on January 1, 2014 for certain large banking organizations, most banking organizations, including Southern National and the Bank, were required to begin complying with these new requirements on January 1, 2015.

&#160;

The Revised Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce as a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. Further, the Revised Capital Rules set forth the following minimum capital ratios, which began to phase in for certain banking organizations, including Southern National, on January 1, 2015:

&#160;

&#167; 4.5 percent CET1 to risk-weighted assets. &#167; 6.0 percent Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets. &#167; 8.0 percent Total Capital to risk-weighted assets. &#167; 4.0 percent Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). &#160;

The Revised Capital Rules also introduce a minimum &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; equal to 2.5% of an organization&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets, which exists in addition to the required minimum asset ratios identified above. The &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; must consist entirely of CET1 and is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Thus, when fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Revised Capital Rules will require us to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (resulting in an effective minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in an effective minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in an effective minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under the Revised Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital will be non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common form of Tier 2 capital will be subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to certain specific requirements set forth in the regulation. Under the capital standards that applied prior to January 1, 2015, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in shareholders&#8217; equity under U.S. GAAP are excluded for the purposes of determining capital ratios. Under the Revised Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded. However, the Revised Capital Rules permit most banking organizations to make a one-time election to continue to exclude these items. This election must be made when we file the first of certain periodic regulatory reports after January 1, 2015. 

&#160;

In addition, under the Revised Capital Rules, certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, generally do not qualify as Tier 1 capital. However for bank holding companies that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after the application of capital deductions and adjustments.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions that it regulates. The federal banking agencies (including the FRB) have adopted substantially similar regulations to implement Section 38 of the FDIA. Section 38 of the FDIA and the regulations promulgated thereunder also specify circumstances under which the FDIC may reclassify a well-capitalized bank as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized bank or an undercapitalized bank to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized bank as critically undercapitalized). The thresholds for each of these categories were recently revised pursuant to the Revised Capital Rules, which are discussed above. These revised categories began to apply to the Bank on January 1, 2015.

&#160;

Under these regulations, insured state banks are assigned to one of the following capital categories:

&#160;

&#8226; &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; &#8211;Under the Revised Capital Rules, a well capitalized institution is one that (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, (iii) has a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. &#8226; &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; &#8211;Under the Revised Capital Rules, an adequately capitalized depository institution is one that has (i) a total risk based capital ratio of 8 percent or more, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent or more, (iii) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or more, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4 percent or more. &#8226; &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; &#8211;Under the Revised Capital Rules, an undercapitalized depository institution is one that has (i) a total capital ratio of less than 8 percent, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6 percent, (iii) a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or (iv) a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent. &#8226; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; &#8211;Under the Revised Capital Rules, a significantly undercapitalized institution is one that has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4 percent, (iii) a CET1 ratio of less than 3 percent or (iv) a leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent. &#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; &#8211; An insured depository institution is critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% of tangible assets. The Revised Capital Rules made certain changes to the framework for calculating an institution&#8217;s ratio of tangible equity to total assets. &#160;

The FRB may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the FRB. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring a new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers.

&#160;

If certain criteria are met, the aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution's total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be &#34;adequately capitalized.&#34; The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes &#34;significantly&#34; or &#34;critically&#34; undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior FRB approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.

&#160;

Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Adequately capitalized institutions (as defined for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules described above) cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits .

&#160; 

Volcker Rule. In December 2013, federal regulators, including the FRB, issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, and their holding companies and affiliates, such as Southern National, from engaging in proprietary trading for their own accounts and acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or having certain relationships with &#8220;covered funds,&#8221; subject to certain exceptions. Southern National and the Bank were required to conform most of their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015. The FRB extended the conformance deadline to July 21, 2016 for certain legacy &#8220;covered funds&#8221; activities and investments in place before December 31, 2013, and the FRB expressed its intention to grant the last available statutory extension for such legacy covered funds activities until July 21, 2017.

&#160;

Payment of Dividends. Southern National is a legal entity separate and distinct from Sonabank. The principal sources of our cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to Southern National&#8217;s stockholders, are dividends that Sonabank pays to its sole shareholder, Southern National. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to Sonabank&#8217;s payment of dividends to us as well as to Southern National&#8217;s payment of dividends to its stockholders.

&#160;

It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under FRB policy, a bank holding company has historically been required to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries. As described above in the discussion of &#8220;Safety and Soundness&#8221; requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, Southern National is expected to commit resources to support Sonabank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary.

&#160;

Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Sonabank . Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the bank will be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; The bank regulatory agencies may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. 

&#160;

The ability of Southern National to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Virginia law. The payment of dividends by Southern National and Sonabank may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

&#160;

In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution. Any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.

&#160;

Because we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiary Sonabank, our right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, arising as a result of their status as shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as us) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.

&#160;

Privacy. Under the GLBA, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA. Sonabank has established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the GLBA.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Audit Reports. Insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution&#8217;s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management&#8217;s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the FDIC, and an attestation by the auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more than $3 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. The FDICIA requires that independent audit committees be formed, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers.

&#160; 

Anti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. In addition, FinCEN issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in August 2014 that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to issue a final rule on this topic. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements.

&#160;

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

&#160;

Virginia Law. Certain state corporation laws may have an anti-takeover affect. Virginia law restricts transactions between a Virginia corporation and its affiliates and potential acquirers. The following discussion summarizes the two Virginia statutes that may discourage an attempt to acquire control of Southern National.

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Virginia Code Sections 13.1-725 &#8211; 727.1 govern &#8220;Affiliated Transactions.&#8221; These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below, require approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares of material acquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder of more than 10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares. Affiliated Transactions include mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of an interested shareholder, or any reclassification, including a reverse stock split, recapitalization, or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries which increases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by any 10% shareholder by more than 5%.

&#160;

For three years following the time that a shareholder becomes an owner of 10% of the outstanding voting shares, a Virginia corporation cannot engage in an Affiliated Transaction with that shareholder without approval of two-thirds of the voting shares other than those shares beneficially owned by that shareholder, and majority approval of the disinterested directors. A disinterested director is a member of the company&#8217;s board of directors who was (i) a member on the date the shareholder acquired more than 10%, and (ii) recommended for election by, or was elected to fill a vacancy and received the affirmative vote of, a majority of the disinterested directors then on the board. At the expiration of the three-year period, the statute requires approval of Affiliated Transactions by two-thirds of the voting shares other than those beneficially owned by the 10% shareholder.

&#160;

The principal exceptions to the special voting requirement apply to transactions proposed after the three-year period has expired and require either that the transaction be approved by a majority of the corporation&#8217;s disinterested directors or that the transaction satisfies the fair-price requirement of the statute. In general, the fair-price requirement provides that in a two-step acquisition transaction, the 10% shareholder must pay the shareholders in the second step either the same amount of cash or the same amount and type of consideration paid to acquire the Virginia corporation&#8217;s shares in the first step.

&#160;

None of the foregoing limitations and special voting requirements applies to a transaction with any 10% shareholder whose acquisition of shares taking him or her over 10% was approved by a majority of the corporation&#8217;s disinterested directors.

&#160;

These provisions were designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia corporations. In addition, the statute provides that, by affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any 10% shareholder, a corporation can adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions shall not apply to the corporation. Southern National &#8220;opted out&#8221; of the Affiliated Transactions provisions when it incorporated.

&#160;

Virginia law also provides that shares acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring person&#8217;s voting strength to meet or exceed any of the three thresholds (20%, 33 1 /3% or 50%) have no voting rights for those shares exceeding that threshold, unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person. This provision empowers an acquiring person to require the Virginia corporation to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider the matter within 50 days of the request. Southern National also &#8220;opted out&#8221; of this provision at the time of its incorporation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Federal Reserve Monetary Policy. The Bank will be directly affected by government monetary and fiscal policy and by regulatory measures affecting the banking industry and the economy in general. The actions of the FRB as the nation&#8217;s central bank can directly affect the money supply and, in general, affect the lending activities of banks by increasing or decreasing the cost and availability of funds. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement this objective are open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, the effects of the various FRB policies on our future business and earnings cannot be predicted.

&#160;

Reserve Requirements. In 1980, Congress enacted legislation that imposed reserve requirements on all depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits. NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to these reserve requirements, as are any nonpersonal time deposits at an institution. For net transaction accounts in 2016, the first $15.2 million will be exempt from reserve requirements. A 3.0% reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts over $15.2 million to and including $110.2 million. A 10.0% reserve ratio will be applied to net transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. These percentages are subject to adjustment by the FRB.

&#160; 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) and the corresponding provisions of the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W thereunder. An affiliate of a bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and Regulation W is generally any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank, with certain exceptions. In general, Section 23A and the corresponding provisions of Regulation W limit the amount of a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; between Sonabank and an affiliate (including a financial subsidiary of Sonabank) to 10% of Sonabank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and limits the aggregate amount of Sonabank&#8217;s &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with all affiliates to 20% of Sonabank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. Section 23A also requires that such covered transactions be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of Southern National or its subsidiaries. &#8220;Covered transactions&#8221; are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.

&#160;

Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the FRA and the corresponding provisions of Regulation W, which generally require that certain covered transactions and other transactions between Sonabank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to Sonabank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons.

&#160;

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as &#8220;insiders&#8221;) contained in the FRA and Regulation O apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution&#8217;s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FRB may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.

&#160; 

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. In 2006, the federal banking agencies, including the FRB, promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance sets forth parameters for risk management practices that are consistent with the level and nature of a financial institution&#8217;s commercial real estate lending portfolio. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm non-residential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment, review and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.

&#160;

In October 2009, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations and also supports prudent loan workouts for financial institutions working with commercial real estate borrowers who are experiencing diminished operating cash flows, depreciated collateral values, or prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties.

&#160;

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may impact the Bank&#8217;s business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets. Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. The banking agencies have jointly issued a final rule to implement these requirements, which will become effective on December 24, 2016 for classes of asset-backed securities other than residential mortgage-backed securitizations.

&#160; 

Cross-Guarantee Provisions. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 contains a &#8220;cross-guarantee&#8221; provision which generally makes commonly controlled insured depository institutions liable to the FDIC for any losses incurred in connection with the failure of a commonly controlled depository institution.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) and related regulations, depository institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practice. The CRA requires the adoption by each institution of a CRA statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution&#8217;s efforts to assist in its community&#8217;s credit needs. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are periodically assigned ratings in this regard. Banking regulators consider a depository institution&#8217;s CRA rating when reviewing applications to establish new branches, undertake new lines of business, and/or acquire part or all of another depository institution. An unsatisfactory rating can significantly delay or even prohibit regulatory approval of a proposed transaction by a bank holding company or its depository institution subsidiaries.

&#160;

The GLBA and federal bank regulators have made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual reports must be made to a bank&#8217;s primary federal regulatory. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating in its latest CRA examination. The Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating in the most recent examination for CRA compliance in August 2012. 

&#160;

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Fair Lending; Consumer Laws. In addition to the CRA, other federal and state laws regulate various lending and consumer aspects of the banking business. Governmental agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, have become concerned that prospective borrowers experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain loans from depository and other lending institutions. These agencies have brought litigation against depository institutions alleging discrimination against borrowers. Many of these suits have been settled, in some cases for material sums, short of a full trial.

&#160;

These governmental agencies have clarified what they consider to be lending discrimination and have specified various factors that they will use to determine the existence of lending discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, including evidence that a lender discriminated on a prohibited basis, evidence that a lender treated applicants differently based on prohibited factors in the absence of evidence that the treatment was the result of prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate, and evidence that a lender applied an otherwise neutral non-discriminatory policy uniformly to all applicants, but the practice had a discriminatory effect, unless the practice could be justified as a business necessity.

&#160;

Banks and other depository institutions also are subject to numerous consumer-oriented laws and regulations. These laws, which include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Expedited Funds Availability Act require compliance by depository institutions with various disclosure requirements and requirements regulating the availability of funds after deposit or the making of some loans to customers.

&#160;

Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations. In addition, oversight responsibility for these and other consumer protection laws and regulations has, in large measure, transferred to the Bureau. The Bureau has republished the transferred regulations in a new section of the Code of Federal Regulations and has begun to issue rules to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

For example, the Bureau issued rules that have impacted our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally, including rules that implement the &#8220;ability-to-repay&#8221; requirement and provide protection from liability for &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability-to-repay rule, which took effect on January 10, 2014, requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, employment, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for lenders that issue certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The ability-to-repay rule defines a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; that are &#8220;higher priced mortgages&#8221; (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, under rules that became effective December 24, 2015, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as &#8220;qualified residential mortgages.&#8221; These definitions are expected to significantly shape the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the U.S.

&#160;

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Reflecting the Bureau&#8217;s focus on the residential mortgage lending market, the Bureau has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) and has finalized integrated mortgage disclosure rules that replace and combine certain requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In addition, the Bureau has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower&#8217;s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers&#8217; applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. The Bureau has indicated that it expects to issue additional mortgage-related rules in the future.

&#160;

In addition, it is anticipated that the Bureau will engage in numerous other rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business, as the Bureau has indicated that, in addition to specific statutory mandates, it is working on a wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services. The Bureau also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate this prohibition, certain aspects of these standards are untested, which has created some uncertainty regarding how the Bureau will exercise this authority. The Bureau has, however, begun to bring enforcement actions against certain financial institutions for UDAAP violations and issued some guidance on the topic, which provides insight into the agency&#8217;s expectations regarding these standards. Among other things, Bureau guidance and its UDAAP-related enforcement actions have emphasized that management of third-party service providers is essential to effective UDAAP compliance and that the Bureau is particularly focused on marketing and sales practices. 

&#160;

We cannot fully predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on our businesses. 

&#160; 

Legislative Initiatives. In light of current conditions and the possibility of continuing weak economic conditions, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and State Legislatures. Such initiatives may change banking statutes and the operating environment for us and Sonabank in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that any potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations with respect thereto, would have, upon the financial condition or results of our operations or the operations of Sonabank. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or Sonabank could have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations or business of our company and Sonabank.

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. Also, on February 7, 2011, the FDIC proposed an interagency rule to implement certain incentive-based compensation requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the proposed rule, financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets would be prohibited from offering incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material financial loss. Regulators have yet to issue final rules on the topic.

&#160;

&#160; 29 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not &#34;large, complex banking organizations.&#34; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

&#160;

Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies. The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject Southern National or the Bank and their subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed above, the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized; fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so; fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan. The VBFI also has broad enforcement powers over the Bank, including the power to impose orders, remove officers and directors and impose fines.

&#160; 

Future Regulatory Uncertainty. Because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations. Southern National fully expects that the financial institution industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices.

&#160;

The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, and regulations that may affect Southern National and the Bank. Numerous other statutes and regulations also will have an impact on the operations of Southern National and the Bank. Supervision, regulation and examination of banks by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, not shareholders.
