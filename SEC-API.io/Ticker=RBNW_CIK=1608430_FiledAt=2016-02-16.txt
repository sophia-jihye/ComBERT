General 

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

Mission Statement of Renewable Energy and Power Inc. : Provide investors with products expanding markets. 

&#160;

Renewable Energy and Power Inc. plans to provide renewable energy that is competitive with fossil fuels by employing proprietary new technologies, and combining them with existing solar and wind power generation and LED lighting. At this time, all solar and wind power energy products are in development and none have been delivered to a customer. 

&#160;

Renewable Energy and Power is a combination of two synergistic: 

&#160;

1. 

Solar Hybrid (Sol-Hy) (All products in development at this time.) 

&#160;

2. 

LED Lites USA (Most products sold through MDI.) 

&#160;

These two divisions operating together within REAP create a synergistic effect for providing green energy. Both companies will function in international markets that are in vigorous growth stages of development, with long-term prospects in both the USA and international markets such as Germany, Spain and possibly South America. Within the USA, solar components are driven by federal and state legislation with tax incentives which vary by state and time. 

&#160;

Solar Hybrid (Sol-Hy) 

&#160;

The primary technology of Solar Hybrid, trade name Sol-Hy, is in solar energy concentration and conversion to electricity. A proprietary holographic lens structure, optical light guide, multi-junction semiconductor, and licensing of patented interconnect technology enables Sol-Hy to offer more efficient collection of solar energy than most existing conventional technologies. These patented processes increase solar cell interconnect reliability, providing higher electrical efficiency and significant production cost savings while conserving expensive semiconductor materials. The Company has licensed a number of patents for this process, and will file proprietary patents on developing technology as well as trademarks, trade names and copyrights.

&#160; &#160;

Sol-Hy's competitive advantages in this field include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

A product in development is a multi-junction solar panel that uses a technology developed for space satellites which outputs twice the power in the same amount of space as multi-crystalline silicon solar panel competitors. The core technology has been proven for years in space satellites and is now ready for wide-spread general power generation. REAP is actively developing a solar panel utilizing this technology and expects to be in limited production by 4th quarter 2016. 

Solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction production cells and 44.4% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package.[11][12] Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available multi-crystalline Si solar cells are around 15%.

The key to Solar Hybrid's success will be the performance and reliability of its panels. All of our products and their components will be rigorously tested to stringent industry standards. Our products are being designed to meet or exceed reliability and life-cycle viability for industry approval under the Energy Star criteria; however these products have not been tested or approved by the authorized agencies at this time. Certification by Underwriter Labs (UL) and other certification organizations are in process and the corporate ground work for ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certifications are underway. These certification guarantees and underwriting will allow worldwide product distribution and installation once completed. Time for initial completion of UL and ISO is currently set for fourth quarter of 2016.

LED Lites USA 

&#160;

LED Lites USA is in the business of producing and marketing LED (Light Emitting Diode) light fixtures and components for both the residential and commercial markets. LED lighting is a green technology that consumes far less energy and requires much less maintenance than competing lighting technologies, making it highly competitive for both retrofit and new lighting systems. 

&#160;

Federal and State Legislation and Federal and State Tax Benefits are driving the LED lighting market not just in the United States but all over the world. 

&#160;

Federal Legislation includes the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed December 2007, confirmed July 15, 2011, requiring phasing out low efficiency incandescent lighting starting in the year 2012 in favor of CFL (Compact Fluorescent Light) bulbs and other high Lumen per Watt technologies. But CFL is at best an interim solution, far less efficient and more toxic (using mercury) than LED lighting which can be expected to be the lighting of choice as costs come down with the expansion of the market. 

&#160;

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 &#160; offers tax incentives to energy-efficient commercial buildings. Any building that can cut its lighting power density by 25-50 percent is eligible to receive a tax reduction of 60 cents per square foot. By converting to LED bulbs, companies can reduce their light electric consumption by 60 percent. Not only do LED users see immediate reductions in their energy bills, they also receive government endorsed tax incentives for making their buildings more energy efficient. 

&#160;

LED Lites USA has its background in power supply technology and thermal management having been a spin-off of Multichip Display, Inc. in late 2012. For more than 20 years, Multichip Display and its predecessor Multichip Assembly has engineered and manufactured power supplies and electronic circuits for demanding military and commercial applications. These power supplies use multi-output switchers, linear and ferro-resonant topologies for the aerospace, defense, telecom, networking and industrial markets, in both custom and standard (VME, PCI, etc.) form factors. 

&#160;

LED Lites USA will both leverage the technology of suppliers and develop technologies and intellectual properties of its own. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been invested by component suppliers, for example in the LED chips themselves. Although, LED Lites USA has the flexibility to use several different suppliers of LED chips, they have developed special pricing contracts with primary suppliers. Flexibility of design will protect us from becoming someone else's captive customer with high pricing. 

&#160;

Our design approach gives LED Lites USA a platform for the Sun Harvesting, Motion Detection and light level selection options. Sun Harvesting provides energy savings through the sensing of ambient light conditions to reduce power on fixtures located near windows or other well illuminated areas while maintaining full light intensity on other fixtures in the same room. Motion Detection adjusts the light intensity to Light Level Selected intensity (reduced levels) when no motion is detected in the room. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

LED Lites USA will use its core skills in thermal management, system packaging and manufacturing to develop and advance technology for two key purposes: 

&#160;

&#183; 

To develop product solutions that maintain a leadership position over its competitors based upon superior cost-benefit to its customers, as well as greater product functionality. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To drive down unit cost while maintaining the key domestic work-force through the advancement of manufacturing and assembly technology and processes. 

&#160;

Federal Legislation 

&#160;

The new energy bill (passed December 2007, confirmed July 15, 2011) will begin phasing out sales of incandescent lighting beginning in 2012. 

&#160;

Tax Incentives 

&#160;

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers tax incentives to energy-efficient commercial buildings. Any building that can cut its lighting power density by 25-50 percent is eligible to receive a tax reduction of 60 cents per square foot. By converting to LED bulbs, companies can reduce their light electric consumption by 60 percent. Not only do LED users see immediate reductions in their energy bills, they also receive government endorsed tax incentives for making their buildings more energy efficient. 

&#160;

"LED lighting is 70-80% more efficient than traditional lighting and can create some very dramatic lighting effects," states Roger Hale, energy consultant and owner of Commercial LED Lighting in Florida, "but the real asset of LED technology is the length of time these lights last." "Conservatively, we estimate that LED lights will last for at least 12 to 15 years, giving them a clear advantage over halogen and compact fluorescent lighting, (CFL)". 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

The immediate business strategy is to pursue contracts with customers with lighting needs for outdoor newly installed and retrofit of existing facilities. We are in negotiations with a highway billboard company to replace the existing lighting on the billboards with LED lights. We are in design stage of this process. We have also quoted directly several large medical care facilities with proprietary LED lighting products. We will continue to manufacture and deliver lighting products for MDI Industries, while the above negotiations are continuing. The solar component of our business is not presently operating awaiting funding. 

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

We presently produce lighting under subcontract for MDI Industries, Inc. These products are primarily for the aeronautical industry. We have access to a full line of lighting from both domestic and foreign sources to supply lighting for new installations and/or retrofit of additional lighting. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We contact commissioned salesmen to sell our products to various business groups, including the outdoor advertising industry, parking lot lights and lighting of sales and inventory areas for car dealers. 

&#160;

When funding to begin operations in the solar power area is available, we will employ the sales force needed to pursue customers in this area. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (i) sourcing parts for products, (ii) warehousing these parts, (iii) designing and fabricating custom LED housings for the customer, (iv) assembling these parts into the products according to the specifications of the customer involved, (v) testing the products to insure that the specifications of the customer are met, and (vi) shipping the products to the customer location. 

&#160;

The assembly process entails the use of various mechanical and electronic tools that are housed in our facility in North Las Vegas. We employ, as contractors, skilled and experienced engineers and technicians. 

&#160;

Management Information and Communication Systems 

&#160;

We use customized computer software systems, as well as commercially-packaged software, for handling order entry and invoicing, manufacturing, inventory management, shipping, warehouse operations, customer service inquiries, accounting operations and management information. We believe that these systems have improved operating efficiencies and customer service. 

&#160;

Materials and Suppliers 

&#160;

We employ a purchasing staff that works with marketing, product development, formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for products as well as other items purchased by us. Raw materials are sourced principally from the United States, Europe and China. Raw materials used by us are available from a variety of suppliers. We seek to mitigate the risk of a shortage of parts and materials through our relationships with our principal suppliers, including identification of alternative suppliers for the same, or similar, parts and materials where available. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

At this time there are no government regulations other than SEC,IRS and Nevada State corporate compliance rules that apply to the Company's operations. The Company believes it is in compliance with all of these agencies rules and regulations. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We are engaged in industries with a high degree of competition. There are many Lighting companies pursuing the same customers. We have a history of excellent products with our present customer, MDI Industries, Inc. and have management with years of experience in our chosen areas of operation. We intend to compete based on price, performance, and the quality of our products. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have exclusives licenses for six patents covering for the solar manufacturing activity when the funding to begin this activity is achieved. As we derive additional products they will be patented and trademarked as necessary. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At September 30, 2015, we employed approximately 5 full-time and approximately 5 part-time contractors. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. 

&#160;

Additional Information 

&#160;

We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a current report on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the Public Reference Room at the SEC located at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The public may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
