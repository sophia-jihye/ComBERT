Company Overview 

&#160; 

Paragon Real Estate Equity and Investment Trust (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Paragon,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a Maryland shell corporation primarily focused on maintaining its corporate existence and Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) reporting history to enable it, in the future, to raise additional capital and make real estate investments. Future real estate investments may include (i) acquisition and development of retail, office, office warehouse, industrial, multifamily, hotel, and other commercial properties, (ii) acquisition of or merger with a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) or a real estate operating company and (iii) joint venture investments. Excess funds can be invested in cash equivalents depending on market conditions. 

&#160; 

The Company was formed on March 15, 1994 as a Maryland REIT. The Company operated as a traditional real estate investment trust by buying, selling, owning and operating commercial and residential properties through December 31, 1999. In 2000, the Company purchased a software technology company, resulting in the Company no longer meeting qualifications to be a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). In 2002, the Company discontinued the operations of the technology segment. 

&#160; 

From 2003 through 2006, we pursued a value-added business plan primarily focused on acquiring well located, under-performing multi-family residential properties, including affordable housing communities, and repositioning them through renovation, leasing, improved management and branding. In 2006, the Company did not complete a public offering for a portfolio acquisition due to market conditions, and consequently, was not able to meet the listing requirements of the former American Stock Exchange (&#8220;Amex&#8221;). Accordingly, Paragon&#8217;s common shares were delisted from the Amex and commenced being quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTC Bulletin Board&#8221;) and on the pink sheets under the symbol &#8220;PRLE&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Because our unrestricted cash was not sufficient to allow us to continue operations, in the third quarter of 2006, three independent trustees on our board of trustees signed subscription agreements to purchase 125,000 Class C Convertible Preferred Shares for an aggregate contribution of $500,000. On November 20, 2015, five trustees on our board of trustees loaned $197,780 to the Company in exchange for convertible notes payable. The loan was made to allow the Company to maintain its existence as a corporate shell current in its SEC filings such that it may be used in the future for real estate transactions or sold to another company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to close a transaction or keep the Company currently filed with the SEC. Even if our management is successful in closing a transaction, investors may not value the transaction or the current filing status with the SEC in the same manner as we did, and investors may not value the transaction as they would value other transactions or alternatives. Failure to obtain external sources of capital and complete a transaction will materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to continue operations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete for the acquisition of properties with many entities, including, among others, publicly traded REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, partnerships and individual investors. Many competitors have substantially greater financial resources than us. In addition, certain competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. If competitors prevent us from buying properties that may be targeted for acquisition, our capital appreciation and valuation may be impacted.
