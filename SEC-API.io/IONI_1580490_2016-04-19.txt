 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Corporate Overview and History of Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (Formerly ALPINE 3, Inc.). 

&#160; 

Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. ALPINE 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities, either debt or equity, before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4, 2014, The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) purchased 10,000,000 shares of common stock which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3, Inc., and subsequently changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. (&#8220;EBC&#8221;) on May 29, 2014. On October 9, 2014 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9,600,000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400,000 shares of common stock. From April 2014 through December 2015, EBC has been in the process of acquiring the Bayhawk brands and related assets, as discussed in more detail below.

&#160;

&#160; 

On October 15, 2014, Bayhawk and EBC entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who voted on the transaction. On September 17, 2015, the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251,212 shares for and 1,600 shares against. As such, Bayhawk sold to EBC, and EBC purchased from Bayhawk, assets of Bayhawk, including but not limited to: (A) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively, the &#8220;Transferred Assets&#8221;). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co. (CA) (&#8220;Evans Brewing California&#8221;) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse, WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed, with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine, California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the &#8220;Exchange Offer&#8221;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

&#160; 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

&#160; 

Closing of Asset Purchase Transaction 

&#160; 

On December 10, 2015, EBC completed the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014 (subsequently amended and restated on August 6, 2015 (as amended, the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;)). 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Agreement, Bayhawk had agreed to sell, and EBC had agreed to purchase, substantially all of Bayhawk&#8217;s assets, as well as its liabilities (collectively, the &#8220;Asset Purchase Transaction&#8221;). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include personal property, intellectual property, inventory, selected distribution contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales labels; and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively, the &#8220;Transferred Assets&#8221;), and the assumption by EBC, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the &#8220;Assumed Liabilities&#8221;). (The &#8220;Evans Brands&#8221; include the former assets of Pig&#8217;s Eye Brewing Company, including its original beers, lagers and ales (&#8220;Pig&#8217;s Eye Brands&#8221;), as well as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk 100% ownership in Evans Brewing California. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC and Bayhawk agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction. Because the principal majority stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC, Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed with the Asset Purchase Transaction if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares not held by Bayhawk&#8217;s majority shareholder, The Michael J. Rapport Trust, or by Evan Rapport, who is an officer of EBC and the son of Michael Rapport) that actually vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal. 

&#160; 

EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;), which went effective on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the &#8220;Bill of Sale&#8221;) which outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the &#8220;Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.

&#160; 

Equipment Lease to Bayhawk 

&#160; 

Following the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC entered into an equipment lease (the &#8220;Equipment Lease&#8221;) with Bayhawk pursuant to which EBC leased the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1, 2015, and continues month to month. Bayhawk agreed to pay a minimum of $15,000 per month or net profits from operations, whichever is greater. The title to the leased equipment will remain with EBC, and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage. 

&#160; 

The foregoing summaries of the terms and conditions of the Bill of Sale, the Assumption Agreement, and the Equipment Lease (collectively, the &#8220;Ancillary Agreements&#8221;) do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement, each of which was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015. 

&#160; 

Change in Shell Company Status 

&#160; 

In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it has assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations. 

&#160; 

Share Exchange 

&#160; 

As discussed in more detail above and below in this Annual Report, as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk common stock that were tendered in connection with such offer, the transaction being referred to as the &#8220;Share Exchange.&#8221; The ratio of the share exchange is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one (1) share of Bayhawk common stock. 

&#160; 

Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the &#8220;Exchange Offer&#8221;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management. 

&#160; 

No Change of Control 

&#160; 

In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not change, and the majority ownership of EBC did not change. 

&#160; 

As noted, prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, there was no way to determine how many shares of Bayhawk common stock will be exchanged for shares of EBC common stock. Nevertheless, Michael J. Rapport owns, through The Michael J. Rapport Trust, a majority of the outstanding common stock of both EBC and Bayhawk. As such, following the closing of the Share Exchange, Mr. Rapport continued to own a majority of the common stock of EBC, and as such, there was no change in control of EBC. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Public House Stock Purchase Agreement 

&#160; 

Additionally on December 10, 2015, EBC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Public House SPA&#8221;) with Michael J. Rapport, as the sole shareholder of EBC Public House, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;Public House&#8221;), for the purchase by EBC of 100% of the outstanding shares of Public House from Mr. Rapport, with the transaction to be closed following completion of due diligence and certain other conditions outlined below. 

&#160; 

By way of background, Mr. Rapport formed Public House to purchase a restaurant business located in Fullerton, California (previously operated as Steamers Jazz Club). Public House is working to renovate and remodel the restaurant, with plans to open in the first half of 2016. Mr. Rapport was the sole shareholder of Public House. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Public House SPA, EBC agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (see description below) in exchange for 100% of the outstanding stock of Public House (the &#8220;Public House Shares&#8221;). The parties anticipate the closing of the transaction once the following conditions, among others, have been met: 

&#160; 

- Public House shall have received all food and beverage licenses, including California Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses, required for the operation of the business; 

&#160; 

- The renovations and remodeling of the restaurant shall have been completed and the restaurant shall be open for business; and 

&#160; 

- Other standard closing conditions. 

&#160; 

The foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Public House SPA does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Public House SPA, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015. 

&#160; 

EBC will provide additional information relating to EBC Public House and the restaurant business, including disclosures required by SEC rules and regulations, upon the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares. 

&#160; 

Certificate of Designation &#8211; Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 

&#160; 

In connection with the Public House SPA, on December 10, 2015, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Certificate of Designation of Rights and Preferences for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Certificate of Designation&#8221;). On December 11, 2015, the Company filed with the State of Delaware the Certificate of Designation, which became part of the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended to date. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;). As noted above, the Company agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport upon the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares. The rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock include the following: 

&#160; 

- Stated Value: The Preferred Stock has a stated value (the &#8220;Stated Value&#8221;) of $1.00 per share. - Dividends: Holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends equal to five percent (5%) per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The dividends may be paid in cash or shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, at the option of the holder. - Voting Rights: The holder of the Preferred Stock has the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which the Preferred Stock could be converted. - Conversion: The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by dividing the number of shares of Preferred Stock by the applicable Conversion Price, which is defined as follows: &#9675; If the Common Stock of the Company has been listed for trading on a public exchange or trading facility, the conversion price for each share of Preferred Stock on any conversion date shall be the lower of (I) seventy percent (70%) of the two (2) lowest closing bid prices over the sixty trading days prior to the conversion date, or (II) the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9675; If the Common Stock of the Company is not trading on the conversion date, the conversion price shall be the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock. - Redemption: The Company has the obligation to redeem the unconverted shares of Preferred Stock from the holder as follows: &#9675; The Company shall have the obligation, as set forth herein, to redeem the unconverted shares of the Preferred Stock at a price equal to the Redemption Price (defined below) as follows: &#161; The Company shall pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock, on a quarterly basis, within thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter, an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the excess revenues, as determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, to redeem shares of Preferred Stock. &#161; The Company shall also pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock, an amount equal to 20% of any capital raised by the Company in connection with offerings of the Company&#8217;s securities (whether private offerings or public offerings), within ten (10) days of the closing of each such offering, to redeem shares of Preferred Stock. &#9675; The &#8220;Redemption Price&#8221; shall be equal to the Stated Value of such shares of Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares to be redeemed. - Liquidation: Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary (a &#8220;Liquidation&#8221;), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company, whether such assets are capital or surplus, for each share of Preferred Stock an amount equal to the Stated Value plus all accrued but unpaid dividends per share, and all other amounts in respect thereof then due and payable before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Securities. &#160; 

EBC anticipates that its issuances of shares of Preferred Stock in connection with the purchase of the Public House Shares, which will occur upon closing of that transaction, will be made without registration under the securities Act of 1933 (the &#8220;1933 Act&#8221;) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

&#160; 

The foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Designation, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015.
