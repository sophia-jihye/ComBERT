Business 

Our Business 

Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc., (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;Heritage Insurance&#8221;) is a property and casualty insurance holding company that provides personal and commercial residential insurance. We are headquartered in Clearwater, Florida and, through our subsidiary, Heritage Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company (&#8220;Heritage P&#38;C&#8221;), we provide personal residential insurance for single-family homeowners and condominium owners, rental property insurance and commercial residential insurance in the state of Florida and North Carolina. We are vertically integrated and control or manage substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, customer service, actuarial analysis, distribution and claims processing and adjusting. We are led by an experienced senior management team with an average of 31 years of insurance industry experience. We began operations in August 2012, and in December 2012 we began selectively assuming policies from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), a Florida state-supported insurer, through participation in a legislatively established &#8220;depopulation program&#8221; designed to reduce the state&#8217;s risk exposure by encouraging private companies to assume insurance policies from Citizens. We also write policies outside the Citizens depopulation program, which we refer to as voluntary policies. Heritage P&#38;C is currently rated &#8220;A&#8221; (&#8220;Exceptional&#8221;) by Demotech, Inc. (&#8220;Demotech&#8221;), a rating agency specializing in evaluating the financial stability of insurers.

In addition to Heritage P&#38;C, our other subsidiaries include: Heritage MGA, LLC, the managing general agent that manages substantially all aspects of our insurance subsidiary&#8217;s business; Contractors&#8217; Alliance Network, LLC, (&#8220;CAN&#8221;) our vendor network manager that also houses with BRC Restoration Specialists Inc. (&#8220;BRC&#8221;), our provider of restoration, emergency and recovery services; Skye Lane Properties, LLC, our property management subsidiary; First Access Insurance Group, LLC, our retail agency; Osprey Re Ltd (&#8220;Osprey&#8221;); our reinsurance subsidiary that provides a portion of the reinsurance protection purchased by our insurance subsidiary; and Heritage Insurance Claims, LLC an inactive subsidiary reserved for future development. The assets of BRC, a building restoration company, were acquired and merged into CAN in 2015. The assets of SVM Restoration Services Inc., (&#8220;SVM&#8221;), a water mitigation company, were acquired and merged into CAN in 2014.

Our Company 

Our company was initially formed as a Florida limited liability company in 2012. On January 1, 2014, we formed a Delaware limited liability company, also named Heritage Insurance Holdings, LLC, and merged with it in order to domicile the Company in Delaware. Effective May 22, 2014, Heritage Insurance Holdings, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc.

Our primary products are personal and commercial residential insurance, which at December 31, 2015 were offered only in Florida under authorization from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (&#8220;FLOIR&#8221;). We conduct our operations under one business segment.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 253,726 personal residential policies in force, representing $478.0 million of annualized premium and 3,405 commercial residential policies in force, representing $113.5 million of annualized premium. Approximately 75% of our personal policies and 72% of our commercial policies as of December 31, 2015 were assumed from Citizens. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had gross premiums written of $586.1 million and $436.4 million, respectively, and net income of $92.5 million and $47.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $837.4 million and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $356.6 million.

As of December 31, 2015, Citizens had approximately 504,000 insurance policies, of which approximately 480,000 were personal residential policies and approximately 8,300 were commercial residential policies. We have selectively assumed pers onal residential policies from Citizens in 22 separate assumption transactions between December 2012 and December 2015, including 10 in 2015. In October 2014 we completed our first commercial residential assumption transaction. A substantial portion of our revenue since our inception has come from these assumed policies. We intend to continue assuming policies from Citizens that meet our assumption strategy and underwriting criteria. However, given the reduced policy count at Citizens resulting from the dep opulation program, we do not anticipate future assumptions to yield as many policies as historical assumption transactions. 

In order to assume a policy from Citizens, we must obtain the prior approval of the insurance agent that wrote the policy. With respect to policies written by agents that are affiliated with an insurance company or agency, we must also obtain the approval of the insurance company or agency. Currently, four large national insurance companies or agencies permit us to assume policies from Citizens that have been written by their agents&#8212;State Farm, Allstate, Brown &#38; Brown and AAA (formerly the American Automobile Association). In an effort to increase the pool of Citizens policies that we may assume, we are seeking similar advance approvals from other insurance companies and agencies. We currently have advance approvals covering more than 5,200 agents. These agents were responsible for writing more than 85% of the eligible personal residential insurance policies held by Citizens as of December 31, 2015.

Recent Developments 

On September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Zephyr Acquisition Company (&#8220;ZAC&#8221;) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, HI Holdings, Inc. and Zephyr Insurance Company, Inc. (&#8220;Zephyr&#8221;), a specialty insurance provider in Hawaii that writes residential property insurance policies that covers the peril of wind. The acquisition will provide Heritage with an immediate presence in Hawaii with Zephyr holding approximately 30% of the wind-only market share in the state. The purchase price for the acquisition is approximately $120.0 million. 

On September 14, 2015, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $20 million share repurchase program under which purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions, block transactions or other techniques, as determined by the Company&#8217;s management. This program is available through December 31, 2016. To date, no shares have been repurchased.

In August 2015, the Company announced it received its certificate of Authority (&#8220;COA&#8221;) to write property and casualty insurance in the state of North Carolina. North Carolina marks the beginning of the Company&#8217;s multi-state expansion. The Company wrote its first policy in North Carolina in January 2016. The Company also was received its COA in South Carolina. The Company has been approved in Alabama and Mississippi. The Company has also submitted applications Massachusetts and Georgia.

In July 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of BRC, a Florida based provider of restoration services and emergency and recovery assistance. At closing, Company paid $6.0 million in cash and 79,850 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock valued at $2.0 million. 

Our Strategy 

Since our inception, a substantial portion of our revenue has come from policies we assumed from Citizens and Sunshine State Insurance Company (&#8220;SSIC&#8221;), with the balance of our revenue generated from renewal of these assumed policies and from voluntary policies. Building on these successful transactions, we intend to continue to grow profitably by undertaking the following:

Increase Our Policies in Force in Florida Through Strategic Policy Assumptions and Expansion of Our Voluntary Market Share

We intend to continue assuming policies from Citizens that meet our assumption strategy and underwriting criteria. We also expect continue to pursue opportunities to acquire policies from private insurers. We will also pursue opportunities to increase the number of our voluntary policies by expanding our independent agent distribution network, as well as obtaining approval from national insurance companies to allow their agents to offer our personal residential policies in Florida. We entered into a marketing agreement with National General Insurance Company and began writing homeowners insurance through their distribution network in early 2016 in the state of North Carolina. We also intend to increase our marketing efforts, which we believe will allow us to more effectively penetrate areas of the state where we are not currently writing significant new business.

Opportunistically Diversify Product Offerings

We will continue to grow our commercial residential business, which we launched in the fourth quarter of 2014 with assumption transactions from Citizens, as well as through voluntary sales. As of December 31, 2015, our commercial residential policies represented approximately $113.4 million of in-force premium, which included $66.0 million from Citizens assumptions. We anticipate most of our future growth in commercial residential will come from voluntary sales, as we have already selected most of the 

commercial policies that meet our underwriting criteria from Citizens. In the fourth quarter of 201 4, we also entered into the manufactured housing line of business by assuming approximately 10,100 policies from Citizens. Additional new product lines may include non-residential coverage, such as general liability insurance. We have had no growth in manu facturing housing during 2015, nor do we anticipate any future growth. 

Optimize Our Reinsurance Program

We will continue to obtain what we believe to be the most appropriate levels and sources of reinsurance. We believe that the significant additional capital entering portions of the reinsurance market provides us with the opportunity to obtain favorable pricing and contract terms and conditions, including multi-year commitments, which comprise a significant portion of our 2015-2016 reinsurance program. In April 2014 and 2015, we entered into fully collateralized catastrophe reinsurance agreements funded through the issuance of a total of $478.0 million principal amount of catastrophe bonds, and we will continue evaluating such cost-efficient alternatives to traditional reinsurance. Additionally, we will continue to meet certain of our reinsurance needs through the use of our reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey, which mitigates our reinsurance expense and reduces our reliance on third-party reinsurance.

Efficiently Manage Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

We are committed to proactively managing our losses and loss adjustment expenses through prudent underwriting and the use of internal claims adjustment and repair services. In March 2014, we acquired the largest vendor in the CAN network, which we believe has allowed us to expand our in-house mitigation and restoration services. We are licensing our CAN employees as adjusters, which we believe will reduce our loss adjustment expenses and shorten the length of time required to resolve claims. Additionally, the acquisition of assets of BRC provides us with additional resources and capabilities to perform restoration services in-house, as well as provide construction resources after a catastrophic event. 

Expand to New Geographic Markets

We intend to explore opportunities to enter other coastal states where we believe the market opportunity is most similar to Florida and where we can utilize our underwriting and claims expertise to attract and manage profitable business. We believe further increasing our geographic diversification is an important factor in reducing our potential risk of loss from any catastrophic event, reducing our per policy reinsurance costs and providing an additional area for future growth beyond our expansion in Florida. In 2015, we received COA to write property and casualty insurance in the states of North Carolina and South Carolina. We received approvals to write property and casualty insurance in the states of Alabama and Mississippi in 2016. We also have submitted applications in Massachusetts and Georgia. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our rapid growth to date and our ability to capitalize on our future growth prospects are a result of the following competitive strengths of our business:

Experienced Management Team With a Long History in the Florida Personal Residential Insurance Market

We have a deep and experienced management team led by Bruce Lucas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Widdicombe, President, Stephen Rohde, Chief Financial Officer, Melvin Russell, Chief Underwriting Officer, Ernesto Garateix, Chief Operating Officer, Sharon Binnun, Executive Vice President Finance, Paul Nielsen, Vice President of Claims, Joseph Peiso, Vice President of Compliance, Randy Jones, President Commercial Division and Arlene Luis, Executive Vice President Commercial. Our management team, which averages 31 years of insurance industry experience, has extensive experience in the Florida personal and commercial residential insurance market, has built longstanding relationships with key participants in the insurance industry and is supported by a group of highly qualified individuals with industry expertise, including a Chief Actuary with more than 36 years of industry experience.

Strong, Conservative Capital Structure

As of December 31, 2015, we had stockholders&#8217; equity of $356.6 million. As of December 31, 2015, Heritage P&#38;C had policyholder surplus, as defined by statutory accounting principles, of $216.6 million. We believe that this level of surplus places us among the best capitalized insurance companies focusing primarily on the Florida personal residential insurance market and is significantly in excess of the minimum capital levels required by FLOIR and Demotech for similarly rated in-state insurance companies. In addition, unlike many of our in-state competitors, we have relied exclusively upon common equity to provide our capital.

Selective Underwriting and Policy Acquisition Criteria 

We believe our proprietary data analytics capabilities and underwriting processes allow us to better select the insurance policies we are willing to assume from the Citizens depopulation program, leading to strong profitability and reduced risk. In addition, we choose to minimize our exposure to or avoid certain types of coverage if we believe there is significant risk of loss, including coverage for sink-hole related losses in high-risk areas. As a result of our efforts, our gross loss ratio was 26.9% and 28.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Unique Claims Servicing Model and Superior Customer Service

We believe that the vertical integration of our claims adjustment and repair services provides us with a competitive advantage. Because we manage both claims adjusting and repair services, we are generally able to begin the adjustment and mitigation process much earlier than our competitors, thus reducing our loss adjustment expenses and ultimate loss payouts. A significant number of our repair technicians are participating in training and certification programs to become licensed claims adjusters (eight out of the nineteen are now licensed), allowing us to capture additional efficiencies. We also believe our unique model provides a superior level of customer service for our policyholders, enhancing our reputation and increasing the likelihood that our policyholders will renew their policies with us.

Relationships with Highly Rated Reinsurers

We manage our exposure to catastrophic events through, among other things, the purchase of reinsurance. Our relationships with highly rated reinsurers have been developed as a result of our management team&#8217;s industry experience and reputation for selective underwriting. Our financial strength, underwriting results and the long-term relationships between our management team and our reinsurance partners help improve the cost-effectiveness of our reinsurance program.

Relationships with Independent Agents and National Underwriters

We have developed relationships with a network of approximately 3,500 independent insurance agents. We believe we have been able to build this network due to our reputation for financial stability, commitment to the Florida market and integrity in the underwriting and claims process. We are also exploring relationships with additional large national insurers and agencies that no longer write substantial personal residential insurance in Florida, which would give us access to their network of Florida agents.

Our Competition 

The market for residential property insurance is highly competitive. In Florida, our primary market there are over 164 licensed insurance companies that are actively writing homeowners&#8217; policies. The table below shows year-to-date in-force premium volume and market share for the top 20 companies in Florida as of September 30, 2015, which is the most recent date for which this information is publicly available. We compete to varying degrees with all of these companies and others, including large national carriers, the state-sponsored homeowners&#8217; insurance entity, and single state or regional carriers.

Products and Distribution 

We market and write personal lines voluntary policies through a network of approximately 1,400 independent agents. Of these agents, approximately 56% are affiliated with eight large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements. We intend to pursue additional voluntary business from agents in our existing independent agent network, expand our independent agent network and seek additional opportunities to use insurer-affiliated agents to offer our personal residential policies in Florida. We had 40,131 voluntary policies (15.6% of our total policies in force) as of December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote an average of 1,920 new voluntary policies per month. We entered into a marketing agreement with National General Insurance Company and began writing homeowners insurance through their distribution network in early 2016 in the state of North Carolina. The voluntary market is a significant component of our growth strategy.

We market and write commercial residential voluntary policies through a network of approximately 60 independent agents. We intend to pursue additional voluntary business from these agents in our existing independent agent network, expand our independent agent network and seek additional opportunities to increase our commercial residential policies in Florida. We started writing voluntary policies in October 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote 898 policies with an average premium of $50,704, totaling $45.5 million in new voluntary policies. The commercial voluntary market is a major component of our commercial growth strategy.

We seek to underwrite a diverse mix of geographic risks within Florida to manage the potential impact of a catastrophic event and reduce our per policy reinsurance costs. As of December 31, 2015, the geographic distribution of our policies in force and total insured values were as follows (figures may not sum to totals due to rounding):

Other significant counties are defined as those counties with a total insured value greater than 2.0% of the $94.9 billion of total insured value as of December 31, 2015. This amount includes policies that do not cover the peril of wind. 

In order to limit our potential exposure to individual risks and catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third party reinsurers. Purchasing reinsurance is an important part of our risk strategy, and premiums paid (or ceded) to reinsurers is our single largest cost. We have strong relationships with reinsurers which we believe are a result of our management&#8217;s industry 

experience and reputation for selective underwriting and effective claim management. For the twelve months beginning June 1, 2014 and 2015, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance from the following sources: (i) the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fun d, a state-mandated catastrophe fund (&#8220;FHCF&#8221;), (ii) private reinsurers, all of which were rated &#8220;A-&#8221; or higher by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;) or Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;), (iii) sponsorship of multiple catastrophe bonds tha t provide $478 million of principal limit that can be drawn upon over a three year period, and (iv) our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey. In addition to purchasing catastrophe reinsurance, we also purchased property risk reinsurance which limits our net exposure in the event of a severe non-catastrophe loss impacting a single location or risk to $1.0 million. We also utilize facultative reinsurance to supplement our per risk reinsurance program where our capacity needs dictate. See &#8220;-Reinsurance &#8211; 2015 &#8211; 2016 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program&#8221;. 

The FLOIR requires all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital reserves and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. Our reinsurance program for the twelve months beginning June 1, 2014 and 2015 provides reinsurance in excess of FLOIR&#8217;s requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks. We also purchase reinsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year.

We test the sufficiency of our reinsurance program by subjecting our personal and commercial residential exposures to statistical testing using the AIR U.S. Hurricane Model, which replicates the most severe hurricanes to have occurred historically in Florida, individual storms of severity in excess of such historical levels, and the historical calendar years in which the most severe multiple catastrophic events occurred in Florida. In this regard, the 2004 calendar year, in which four large catastrophic hurricanes made landfall in Florida, is considered to be the worst catastrophic year in Florida&#8217;s recorded history. Assuming the reoccurrence of the 2004 calendar year events, the probable maximum net loss to us in 2015, based on the coverage for our 2015-2016 reinsurance program, would be $36.9 million (after tax, net of all reinsurance recoveries and including our retention through Osprey). This loss would have represented 10.4% of our stockholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2015.

We closely manage all aspects of our claims adjustment process. Claims are initially reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who determine the extent of the loss and the resources needed to adjust each claim. In the case of a catastrophic event, we have contracted with four large national claims adjusting firms to assist our adjusters with the increased volume of claims and ensure timely responses to our policyholders. We utilize our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAN, to manage mitigation and restoration services for our customers. CAN primarily handles water damage-related claims, which comprised approximately 73% of our losses and loss adjustment expenses through December 31, 2015. In March 2014, we completed the acquisition of the assets and personnel of our main water mitigation services vendor. This acquisition has allowed us to better service our customers and expand our mitigation and restoration services. In addition, all of our voluntary policies and renewed Citizens policies are enrolled in our Platinum Preferred Savings Program (the &#8220;Platinum Program&#8221;). Under the Platinum Program, customers receive a 10% discount on their claim deductible, and we obtain control over inspection, claims adjusting and repair services. We believe our approach to claims handling results in a higher level of customer service and reduces our losses and loss adjustment expenses. As a result of our efforts, our gross loss ratio, which expresses our losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums, was 26.9% and 28.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we utilize our recent acquisition, BRC, to manage and provide restoration services to CAN customers for all types of claims. BRC currently provides services for non-insurance related projects which we expect to decrease in future periods.

Our Market 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, at December 23, 2014, Florida was the third largest U.S. state with an estimated population of approximately 20 million people. The University of Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research estimates that Florida is expected to reach a population of approximately 26 million people by 2040, an increase of 36% from 2010. Property ownership and development represent key drivers of the Florida economy.

Because of its geography, Florida is exposed to an increased risk of hurricanes during the entire six months of the Atlantic hurricane season, which spans from June 1 through November 30. While a significant hurricane has not made landfall in Florida since 2005, eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, including Hurricanes Charley, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, caused a combined estimated property damage of over $110 billion, a significant portion of which occurred in Florida. As a result, personal residential insurance and claims servicing are vitally important to Florida residents.

The Florida residential insurance market is highly fragmented and dominated by in-state insurance companies, including Citizens. Significant dislocation in the Florida property insurance market began following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and accelerated following the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. In total, national and regional insurers reduced their share of the market in Florida from 84% in 1999 to 26% in 2012. As national and regional insurance companies reduced their exposure in Florida, Citizens increased efforts to provide affordable residential insurance to those residents unable to obtain coverage in the private market. As a result, Citizens&#8217; policy count grew from roughly 726,000 policies in 2005 to a peak level of approximately 1.5 million policies in late 2011. 

To reduce Citizens&#8217; risk exposure, beginning in 2010, Florida elected officials encouraged Citizens to focus on reducing the size of its portfolio by returning policies to the private market. In response, Citizens instituted a number of measures to ince ntivize the private sector to participate in the depopulation program. Some of these initiatives include increased inspections, improved underwriting, reductions in coverage and annual rate increases. Depopulation efforts have been successful, as Citizens&#8217; policy count at December 31, 2015 was approximately 504,000. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 192,000 of Heritage&#8217;s in force policies were assumed through the depopulation program. 

According to data compiled by FLOIR, which excludes State Farm Florida Insurance Company, Citizens was the largest residential insurance carrier in Florida as of September 30, 2015, with a market share of approximately 11.1% based on total in force direct premiums written for personal and commercial residential insurance. As of the same date, we ranked third in Florida within this market, with a market share of approximately 5.2%, and through our depopulation efforts, we have grown substantially since inception in 2012. Assuming further access to capital and reinsurance support, we believe we have the opportunity to significantly expand the size of our personal and commercial residential insurance business in Florida and of our business into other complementary business lines and states. In 2015, we received our COA to write property and casualty insurance in the state of North and South Carolina. We received approval to write property and casualty insurance in Alabama and Mississippi. We have also submitted applications in Massachusetts and Georgia. 

In recent years, the property and casualty insurance market has experienced a substantial increase in the availability of property catastrophe reinsurance resulting from the increased supply of capital from non-traditional insurance providers, including private capital and hedge funds. This increased capital supply, coupled with a lack of recent significant catastrophic storm activity in Florida, has reduced the cost of property catastrophe reinsurance, directly benefitting purchasers of this reinsurance, including us. 

Underwriting 

Our underwriters evaluate and select only those risks that they believe will enable us to achieve an underwriting profit. In order to achieve underwriting profitability on a consistent basis, we focus on (1) the suitability of the risk to be assumed or written, (2) the adequacy of the premium with regard to the risk to be assumed or written and (3) the geographic distribution of existing policies within Florida.

All of our personal lines underwriting is done internally under the supervision of our Chief Underwriting Officer with input from our Chief Actuary and our Director of Risk Management. Our commercial lines underwriting is done internally under the supervision of our Executive Vice President Commercial Division. Our underwriters use our proprietary data analytics capabilities, which include a number of automated processes, to analyze a number of risk evaluation factors, including the age, construction, location and value of the residence and the premiums to be received from insuring the residence. New technological advances in computer generated geographical mapping afford us an enhanced perspective as to geographic concentrations of policyholders. When considering the geographic distribution of existing policies, our underwriters may consider the number of other residences we insure within the same region, county, city and zip code. We also consider the cost of reinsurance when assessing the adequacy of the premium with regard to the risk to be assumed or written. In particular, because we assume policies from Citizens in large quantities, we must evaluate the aggregate impact of the assumed policies on our reinsurance program. The underwriting criteria that we consider will continue to evolve as our business grows and expands.

We also review our expiring policies to determine whether those risks continue to meet our underwriting guidelines. If a given policy no longer meets our underwriting guidelines, we will take appropriate action regarding that policy, including raising premium rates or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and our assumption agreements with Citizens, not offering to renew the policy.

Policy Administration 

We have engaged West Point Underwriters, Inc. and Majesco Mastec, providers of web-based software solutions and insurance personnel, to provide us with policy administration services for our business, including processing, billing and policy maintenance. The software is able to adapt to a variety of forms and rates, handle the administration of an increasing number of policies as our Company grows and expands, and provide detailed information about our book of business to our internal underwriters so that they can adjust our underwriting criteria as necessary. The software provides us with daily updates regarding the insurance policies that we have issued. The systems also allow us to provide renewal notices, late payment notices, cancellation notices, endorsements and policies to our policyholders in a timely fashion.

Claims Administration 

We closely manage all aspects of the claims process, from processing the initial filing to providing remediation services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAN. When a policyholder contacts us to report a claim, members of our claims department create a claim file and aggregate the appropriate supporting documentation. Claims are then reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who 

assess the extent of the loss, including through on-site investigations, and determine the resources needed to adjust each claim. Our claims are generally adju sted by our staff claims professionals, except in the case of a catastrophic event for which we have contracted with four large national claims adjusting firms to assist our adjusters with the increased volume of claims and ensure timely responses to our p olicyholders. In the final stage of the claims process, we leverage CAN vendor network to provide repair and remediation services to the policyholder. 

We perform or supervise the services rendered to our policyholders at all stages of the claims process, which we believe allows us to reduce cost and provide a high level of customer service to our policyholders. To encourage our policyholders to allow us to manage their claims from beginning to end, we developed our Platinum Program. Under the Platinum Program, participating customers receive a 10% discount on their claim deductible, and we obtain control over inspection, claims adjusting and repair services, with the repair services being managed by either CAN or one of our contracted vendors. In March 2014, we acquired the largest vendor in the CAN network, which has allowed us to expand our in-house mitigation and restoration services. In August 2015, we acquired BRC to allow us to further expand our restoration services.

Citizens Assumption Transactions 

As of December 31, 2015, we have assumed, net of cancellations, an aggregate of approximately 192,000 policies through participation in the Citizens depopulation program. Citizens generally offers depopulations on a monthly basis. From December 2012 through December 2015, we participated in 22 depopulations. We have also been approved for depopulation during the first quarter of 2016 and continue to seek monthly approvals. 

In order to be eligible to participate in an assumption transaction, we first apply to FLOIR for approval to assume a specified number of policies. We prepare and submit a report showing the cumulative pro forma financial impact of assuming all policies for which we have applied and all policies we have been previously approved to assume. Once we have received FLOIR approval indicating the maximum number of policies we may assume, Citizens provides us with a list of policies eligible for assumption and the relevant policy data. We evaluate these policies using our proprietary data analytics capabilities and submit to Citizens a list of policies we would like to assume. Citizens then compares our list of preferred policies with those of other private insurance companies participating in the depopulation and informs us which policies will be assigned to us.

Once Citizens informs us which policies we may assume, we notify each policyholder of our offer to assume their policy, the amount of their estimated premium upon renewal and their right to opt-out of the assumption transaction. On the effective date of such transaction, Citizens transfers to us the unearned premiums for the policies that have not opted out of the assumption transaction. A policyholder may also opt-out during the 30-day period following the effective date of the assumption transaction. If a policyholder opts-out during such period, we return the applicable unearned premiums to Citizens.

Under the terms of our typical assumption agreement with Citizens, we assume all liability and obligation for losses under the assumed policies arising on or after the effective date of the assumption transaction, and we directly service all policyholder claims related to such losses. All terms and conditions of the assumed policies, including coverage and rates, remain unchanged for the remainder of the policy term. Citizens remains liable for all losses under the assumed policies arising prior to the effective date of the assumption transaction and is solely responsible for servicing all policyholder claims related to such losses.

We strive to retain these policies by offering competitive rates and efficient claims handling to our policyholders. Through December 31, 2015, we renewed approximately 85% of the policies we assumed from Citizens upon their initial expiration.

Technology 

Our business depends upon the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable us to provide a high level of service to agents and policyholders by processing business efficiently, communicating and sharing data with agents, providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums and allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for our management. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and customers, increased efficiencies in processing Heritage P&#38;C&#8217;s business and lower operating costs.

We also license software from third parties, including West Point Underwriters, Majesco Mastec and AIR Worldwide, Inc. (&#8220;AIR&#8221;). AIR&#8217;s catastrophe modeling software enables us to optimize our insurance portfolio to manage our reinsurance costs. We also own or license other technology systems used by Heritage P&#38;C. These technology systems consist primarily of an integrated central processing computer, a series of server-based computer networks, a back-up server and various Internet-based communications systems.

Reinsurance 

In order to limit our potential exposure to catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third party reinsurers and sponsor catastrophe bonds (Citrus Re). We also purchase property per risk reinsurance and facultative coverage for non-catastrophe related to losses in excess of $1.0 million. Purchasing reinsurance is an important part of our risk strategy, and premiums paid (or ceded) to reinsurers is our single largest cost. Reinsurance involves transferring, or &#8220;ceding&#8221;, a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain liable for the entire insured loss. See in Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. We may not be able to collect reinsurance amounts due to us from the reinsurers with which we have contracted.

Our reinsurance agreements are short-term, prospective contracts. We record an asset, prepaid reinsurance premiums, and a liability, reinsurance payable, for the entire contract amount upon commencement of our new reinsurance agreements. We amortize our reinsurance premiums over the 12-month contract period, which is June 1 through May 31.

In the event that we incur losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable under our reinsurance program, we record amounts recoverable from our reinsurers on paid losses plus an estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses. The estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses is a function of our liability for unpaid losses associated with the reinsured policies; therefore, the amount changes in conjunction with any changes to our estimate of unpaid losses. As a result, a reasonable possibility exists that an estimated recovery may change significantly in the near term from the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements.

FLOIR requires all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic even t. Our 2015-2016 reinsurance program provides reinsurance in excess of FLOIR&#8217;s requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on our port folio of insured risks. The nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer&#8217;s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration o f insured value within such portfolio. As a result, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100 year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company. We also purchase r einsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year. 

2015 &#8211; 2016 Reinsurance Program

During the second quarter of 2015, we placed our reinsurance program for the period from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016. Our reinsurance program, which is segmented into layers of coverage, protects us for excess property catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses. Our 2015-2016 reinsurance program incorporates the mandatory coverage required by law to be placed with FHCF. For the 2015 hurricane season, we selected 75% participation in the FHCF. We also purchased private reinsurance below, alongside and above the FHCF layer, as well as aggregate reinsurance coverage. The following describes the various layers of the June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 reinsurance program.

&#160;

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s Retention . For the first catastrophic event, we have a primary retention of the first $35 million of losses and loss adjustment expenses, of which Osprey is responsible for $20 million. For a second event, Heritage P&#38;C&#8217;s primary retention decreases to $5 million and Osprey is responsible for $10 million. To the extent that there is reinsurance coverage remaining, Heritage P&#38;C has a $5 million primary retention for events beyond the second catastrophic event. Osprey has no primary retention beyond the second catastrophic event. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Layers Below FHCF . Immediately above our retention, we have purchased $440 million of reinsurance from third party reinsurers. Through the payment of a reinstatement premium, we are able to reinstate the full amount of this reinsurance one time. To the extent that $440 million or a portion thereof is exhausted in a first catastrophic event, we have purchased reinstatement premium protection insurance to pay the required premium necessary for the reinstatement of this coverage. A portion of this coverage wraps around the FHCF and provides coverage alongside and above the FHCF. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

FHCF Layer . Our FHCF coverage includes an estimated maximum provisional limit of 75% of $920 million, or $690 million, in excess of its retention and private reinsurance of $336 million. The limit and retention of the FHCF coverage is subject to upward or downward adjustment based on, among other things, submitted exposures to FHCF by all participants. We purchased coverage alongside from third party reinsurers and through reinsurance agreements with Citrus Re Ltd To the extent the FHCF coverage is adjusted, this private reinsurance with third party reinsurers and Citrus Re Ltd will adjust to fill in any gaps in coverage up to the reinsurers&#8217; aggregate limits for this layer. The FHCF coverage cannot be reinstated once exhausted, but it does provide coverage for multiple events.

&#160;

&#8226; 

CAT Bond Layer alongside the FHCF . During April 2015 Heritage P&#38;C entered into three catastrophe reinsurance agreements with Citrus Re Ltd. The agreements provide for three years of coverage from catastrophic losses caused by named storms, including hurricanes, beginning on June 1, 2015. Heritage P&#38;C pays a periodic premium to Citrus Re Ltd during this three-year risk period. Citrus Re Ltd issued in aggregate of $277.5 million of principal-at-risk variable notes due April 2017 to fund the reinsurance trust account and its obligations to Heritage P&#38;C under the reinsurance agreements. These notes were issued in three classes. The Class A notes provide $150 million of coverage for the layer immediately above the FHCF. The Class B notes provide $97.5 million of coverage, and the Class C notes provide $30 million of coverage. The Class B and Class C notes provide reinsurance coverage for a sliver of the catastrophe coverage that had previously been provided by the FHCF. The limit of coverage is fully collateralized by a reinsurance trust account for the benefit of Heritage P&#38;C. The maturity date of the notes may be extended up to two additional years to satisfy claims for catastrophic events occurring during the three-year term of the reinsurance agreements.

&#160;

&#8226; 

CAT Bond Layer above the FHCF . Immediately above the FHCF layer is the coverage provided by the 2015 reinsurance agreement entered into with Citrus Re as described above in this footnote. The Citrus Re 2015 Class A notes provide up to $150 million of coverage immediately above the FHCF layer. Coverage immediately above the 2015 Class A notes is provided by the 2014 reinsurance agreements entered into with Citrus Re Ltd. The first contract with Citrus Re Ltd provides $150 million of coverage and the second contract provides an additional $50 million of coverage.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Aggregate Coverage . In addition to the layers described above, we have also purchased $125 million of aggregate reinsurance coverage for losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of $1.648 billion for a first catastrophic event. To the extent that this coverage is not fully exhausted in the first catastrophic event, it provides coverage commencing at its reduced retention for second and subsequent events and where underlying coverage has been previously exhausted. There is no reinstatement of the aggregate reinsurance coverage once exhausted, but it does provide coverage for multiple events.

For a first catastrophic event, our reinsurance program provides coverage for $1.8 billion of losses and loss adjustment expenses, includi ng our retention, and we are responsible for all losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of such amount. For subsequent catastrophic events, our total available coverage depends on the magnitude of the first event, as we may have coverage remaining f rom layers that were not previously fully exhausted. We have also purchased reinstatement premium protection insurance to provide an additional $440.0 million of coverage. Our aggregate reinsurance layer also provides coverage for second and subsequent eve nts to the extent not exhausted in prior events. In total, we have purchased $2.3 billion of potential reinsurance coverage, including our retention, for multiple catastrophic events. Our ability to access this coverage, however, will be subject to the sev erity and frequency of such events. As of August 31, 2015, the peak of the hurricane season, our total insured value was $76.9 billion, and we may experience significant losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of our retention. The chart below provid es a graphic illustration of the structure and operations of our 2015-2016 catastrophe reinsurance program. 

In placing our 2015-2016 reinsurance program, we sought to capitalize on favorable reinsurance pricing and mitigate uncertainty surrounding the future cost of our reinsurance by negotiating multi-year arrangements. The $477.5 million of aggregate coverage we have purchased from Citrus Re Ltd, which includes both the 2014 Class A &#38; B notes and 2015 Class A, B, and C notes, extends $200.0 million for another two-year period and $277.5 million for a three-year period. To the extent it is all or partially exhausted before the end of three years, it cannot be reinstated. In the aggregate, multi-year coverage accounts for approximately 45% of our purchases of private reinsurance for the 2015 hurricane season. The terms of each of the multi-year coverage arrangements described above are subject to adjustment depending on, among other things, the size and composition of our portfolio of insured risks in future periods. 

Assuming the reoccurrence of Hurricane Andrew, which is considered to be the most catastrophic single event in Florida&#8217;s recorded history, the probable maximum net loss to us in 2015, assuming the reinsurance coverage described above, would be $30.8 

million (after tax, net of all reinsurance recoveries and including our retention through Osprey Re). This loss would have represented 8.7% of our stockholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2015. We estimate that, based on our portfolio of insured risks a s of August 31, 2015, Hurricane Andrew would have represented a catastrophic event likely to occur approximately once every 31 years and would have exhausted approximately 39.5% of our total expected reinsurance coverage. 

For the twelve months ending May 31, 2016, we purchased reinsurance from the following sources: (i) FHCF, (ii) Citrus Re Ltd, (iii) 23 third-party private reinsurers, all of which were rated &#8220;A-&#8221; or higher by A.M. Best or S&#38;P and (iv) our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey. Allianz Global Corporate &#38; Specialty SE provides approximately 38% of our third-party reinsurance program, including Citrus Re catastrophe bonds. The chart below lists our third-party reinsurers with A.M. Best and S&#38;P ratings:

Investments 

Our investments are managed by seven third-party asset managers. We have designed our investment policy to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital and the liquidity requirements of our operations. As such, our investable assets are primarily held in cash and bonds with relatively short durations. Our investment policy sets guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with Florida statutes that emphasizes quality and preservation of capital. The policy limits investments in common and preferred stocks to 15% of Heritage P&#38;C&#8217;s admitted assets, with no more than 10% in either class.

Government Regulation 

The insurance industry is extensively regulated. Heritage P&#38;C is subject to the laws and regulations of Florida and any other state where we may seek to do business. Florida&#8217;s insurance regulatory regime provides for regulation of virtually all aspects of Heritage P&#38;C&#8217;s business. Florida, like many states, has adopted several model laws and regulations as promulgated by the NAIC. 

State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company that is part of a holding company group to register with t he department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends and consolidated tax allocation agreements. In many instances, Florida&#8217;s insurance laws and regulations are even more stringent that those promulgat ed by the NAIC or other states. 

As an initial matter, Florida routinely places additional restrictions on new insurers as a condition of receiving a certificate of authority. These restrictions are typically memorialized in a consent order entered into between FLOIR and the insurer applying for a certificate of authority. We are subject to such a consent order in which we have agreed to higher or more stringent restrictions than are otherwise required under Florida law. The material restrictions we have agreed to include:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Florida law requires a residential property writer to maintain surplus of the greater of $15.0 million or 10% of its liabilities. Pursuant to the consent order, we agreed to establish a minimum capital and surplus of $18.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, our insurance subsidiary held surplus of $216.6 million, in full compliance with Florida law and the consent order.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Florida law restricts the ratio of premiums written to policyholder surplus to 10 to 1 on a gross basis and 4 to 1 on a net of reinsurance basis. As of December 31, 2015, Heritage P&#38;C&#8217;s gross and net writing ratios were 2.7 to 1 and 1.8 to 1, respectively. Pursuant to the consent order, we also agreed to not exceed the projected premiums in the plan of operation submitted with our original application for licensure without the prior written approval of FLOIR during 2013, 2014 and 2015. As part of the FLOIR approval process for the various Citizens assumption transactions in which we have participated, we have received approval to exceed these projected premiums. We are in full compliance with these provisions of the consent order.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Florida law places no restrictions on the parent of an insurer, or other upstream entities, with regard to the payment of dividends. Pursuant to the consent order, we agreed to not make any distributions to stockholders prior to July 31, 2015, except such distributions as are required to offset stockholders&#8217; tax obligations resulting from the ownership of our equity or such distributions as may be approved by FLOIR in advance and in writing. We are in full compliance with this provision of the consent order.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Florida law allows an insurer to pay certain dividends to stockholders without approval of FLOIR. Pursuant to the consent order, we agreed that, until July 31, 2017, Heritage P&#38;C would pay only those dividends that have been approved in advance and in writing by FLOIR. Our insurance subsidiary has paid no stockholder dividends since its inception and is in full compliance with this provision of the consent order.

We are also subject to consent orders setting conditions for FLOIR&#8217;s approval of the Citizens assumption transactions in which we have participated. We are required by consent order to comply with the assumption agreements entered into with Citizens at the time of each assumption transaction, which requires that for the assumed policies, we must offer to renew each policy for a minimum of three years. In addition, three of our assumptions in 2013 limited rate increases to the higher of those approved by FLOIR for Citizens for comparable risks or 10%. We are in full compliance with all consent orders issued with regard to Citizens&#8217; depopulation program.

Additionally, we are subject to regulations administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business. These regulations relate to, among other things:

&#160;

&#8226; 

the content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;

&#160;

&#8226; 

the amount of premiums the insurer may assume or write in relation to its surplus;

&#160;

&#8226; 

the amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;

&#160;

&#8226; 

participation in guaranty funds and other statutorily created markets or organizations;

&#160;

&#8226; 

business operations and claims practices;

&#160;

&#8226; 

approval of policy forms and premium rates;

&#160;

&#8226; 

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;

&#160;

&#8226; 

licensing of insurers and their products;

&#160;

&#8226; 

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;

&#160;

&#8226; 

restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to insurance holding companies;

&#160;

&#8226; 

restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;

&#160;

&#8226; 

requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;

&#160;

&#8226; 

requiring certain methods of accounting;

&#160;

&#8226; 

periodic examinations of our operations and finances;

&#160;

&#8226; 

the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and

&#160;

&#8226; 

requiring reserves.

FLOIR and regulators in other jurisdictions where we may become licensed and offer insurance products conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers&#8217; business practices. Additionally, as an insurance company operating in Florida, Heritage P&#38;C is subject to assessments levied by Citizens, the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association and the FHCF.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 247 employees, all of whom are full time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
