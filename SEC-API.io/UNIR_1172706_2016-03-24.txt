 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

On November 10, 2014, Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. (&#8220;Uniroyal Global&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) acquired all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC (&#8220;Uniroyal&#8221;), a U.S. manufacturer of textured coatings, and all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited (&#8220;EPAL&#8221;), the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited (&#8220;Wardle Storeys&#8221;), a European manufacturer of textured coatings and polymer films. Management of the acquired entities was not altered in the acquisitions.

&#160;

Uniroyal Global made the acquisition of Uniroyal through its newly formed subsidiary, UEP Holdings, LLC (&#8220;UEPH&#8221;), to which it contributed certain of its assets and liabilities as part of the organization of that subsidiary. The aggregate purchase consideration paid for 100% of the outstanding equity of Uniroyal was preferred ownership interests issued by UEPH having an aggregate face value of $35 million. In a separate transaction, Uniroyal Global also purchased EPAL for aggregate consideration of for 100 shares of Uniroyal Global&#8217;s Common Stock and Uniroyal Global&#8217;s guaranty of outstanding EPAL preferred stock retained by the seller having a face value of &#163;12,601,198 (approximately $20 million at closing). Details of the acquisition are set forth in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 10, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

We are a manufacturer and seller of vinyl coated fabrics products that have various high performance characteristics and capabilities and derive our revenue principally through our subsidiaries Uniroyal and Wardle Storeys. Our coated fabrics products are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings. Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment. In the automotive industry our products are used primarily in seating, door panels, head and arm rests, security shades and trim components, including instrument panels, door casings, seating, gear lever and steering column gaiters, headliners and load space covers. Non-automotive applications include outdoor seating for utility and sports vehicles, and sheeting used in medical, nuclear protection, personal protection, moisture barriers, pram and nursery, movie screen and decorative surface applications. Our primary brands names include Naugahyde &#174; , BeautyGard &#174; , Flameblocker&#8482;, Spirit Millennium &#174; , Ambla &#174; , Amblon &#174; , Velbex &#174; , Cirroflex &#174; , Plastolene &#174; and Vynide &#174; .

&#160;

We are the successor to a long line of businesses that have manufactured vinyl coated fabrics. Our best known brand, Naugahyde, is the product of many improvements on a rubber-coated fabric developed a century ago in Naugatuck, Connecticut. We design, manufacture and market a wide selection of vinyl coated fabric products under a portfolio of recognized brand names. We believe that our business has continued to be a leading supplier in its marketplace because of our ability to provide specialized materials with performance characteristics customized to the end-user specifications, complemented by technical and customer support for the use of our products in manufacturing.

&#160;

We continue to maintain our legacy Smartgate technology business through our subsidiary Invisa Security Systems, Inc. Our sensors are based on presence sensing technology that we call InvisaShield. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Principal Products and Their Markets 

&#160;

Our vinyl coated fabrics products have undergone considerable evolution and today are distinguished by superior performance in a wide variety of applications as alternatives to leather, cloth and other synthetic fabric coverings. Our standard product lines consist of more than 600 SKUs with combinations of colors, textures, patterns and other properties. Our products are differentiated by unique protective top finishes, adhesive back coatings and transfer print capabilities. Additional process capabilities include embossing grains and patterns, and rotogravure printing, which imparts character prints and non-registered prints, lamination and panel cutting.

&#160;

Our vinyl coated fabrics products have various high performance characteristics and capabilities. They are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, more cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings. Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment. We manufacture materials in a wide range of colors and textures. They can be hand or machine sewn, laminated to an underlying structure, thermoformed to cover various substrates or made into a variety of shapes for diverse end-uses. We are a long-established supplier to the global automotive industry and manufacture products for interior trim components from floor to headliner which are produced to meet specific component production requirements such as cut and sew, vacuum forming/covering, compression molding, and high frequency welding. Some products are supplied with micro perforations, which are necessary on most compression molding processes. Materials can also be combined with polyurethane or polypropylene foam laminated by either flame or hot melt adhesive for seating, fascia and door applications.

&#160;

The automotive sector represented approximately 60.4% of our total sales in 2015. Our products are used primarily in the following automotive applications:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Seating &#160; &#183; Door panels &#160; &#183; Head and arm rests &#160; &#183; Security shades &#160; &#183; Components &#160;

The non-automotive transportation sector represented 15.2% of our 2015 sales and primarily consisted of seating products for original equipment manufacturers of non-automotive and light truck vehicles in the following five categories:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Personal watercraft, ATV&#8217;s, snowmobiles, golf carts &#160; &#183; Light and heavy industrial equipment and agricultural equipment (tractors, bulldozers) &#160; &#183; Recreational vehicles, vans and motor homes &#160; &#183; Heavy and medium trucks &#160; &#183; Mass transit (trains, buses) &#160;

The distribution market sector represented approximately 14.5% of our 2015 sales and consists primarily of sales of the standard Naugahyde and Ambla product lines to local furniture shops, smaller furniture manufacturers and companies serving the hospitality and automotive and marine aftermarkets for refurbishing and replacement. The sales organization employed to service this market is a network of approximately 40 distributor locations.

&#160;

The contract sector, which represented approximately 9.9% of our 2015 sales, includes contract furniture/upholstery, marine, healthcare, child care, and industrial equipment.

&#160;

&#160;

Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users. For example, for recreational products used outdoors, such as boats, personal watercraft, golf carts and snowmobiles, a product designed primarily for durability and weatherability is used. We also manufacture a line of products called BeautyGard &#174; , with water-based topcoats that contain agents to protect against bacterial and fungal microorganisms and can withstand repeated cleaning, a necessity in the restaurant and health care industries. These topcoats are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based topcoats. The line is widely used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Flame and smoke retardant vinyl coated fabrics are used for a variety of commercial and institutional furniture applications, including hospitals, restaurants and residential care centers and seats for school buses and aircraft.

&#160;

We produce vinyl coated fabrics and laminated composites through a continuous cast manufacturing process. The continuous cast method yields a material with a soft finish, deep grain pattern, wide temperature tolerance range and high malleability factor for thermoforming. In addition, we possess plastisol-compounding capability, a variety of proprietary formulations and highly versatile finishing processes. We believe that our products are differentiated in the market by unique protective topcoat finishes and adhesive back coats, as well as rotogravure printing, which imparts multiple features, character prints and non-registered prints. We also have the in-house capability to perform transfer printing as well as micro-perforation, which provides product breathability.

&#160;

We seek to ensure that every product fully meets customer requirements of specification, reliability and performance.

&#160;

We believe that we maintain our market leadership position through a strong research and development effort that provides strong product development capability. This yields enhanced product characteristics, lower cost of material combinations and new proprietary product formulations. We estimate that approximately 16% of our sales relate to products developed to customer specifications.

&#160;

Our Stoughton, Wisconsin facility achieved ISO 9001:2008 status in 1999 and has renewed it annually since then. Our UK facility achieved ISO TS 16949 status in 2004 and is approved to the European Council Directive 96/98 EX on Marine Equipment as amended for Module D Production Quality

&#160;

We hold no patents but maintain certain of our process technologies as trade secrets.

&#160;

Our legacy Smartgate safety sensors are used in or with parking gates to protect life and property. Our sensors are based on presence-sensing technology that we call InvisaShield. Although we believe that our InvisaShield technology may have additional applications for safety products, substantially all of our revenue from this business has been derived from the sale of SmartGate sensors used in parking gates.

&#160; 

Our Distribution Methods 

&#160;

Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users. We currently serve customers world-wide with 18 full-time sales persons in offices in Sarasota, Florida, Nappanee, Indiana and Earby, Lancashire, two exclusive agents in Italy, and Turkey and an extensive distributor network in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, France, Germany and Hong Kong. 12% of our worldwide sales in 2015 were made through distributors. The industrial business is supported mainly from stock and via a catalogue.

&#160;

We maintain websites for our principal U.S. non-automotive products at www.naugahyde.com and for our global products at www.wardlestoreys.com and www.ambla.com . 

&#160;

Our top 25 customers account for approximately 63% of our sales. No single customer accounted for more than 14% of our total sales in 2015.

&#160;

We sell our safety sensor products directly to manufacturers, dealers and end users. We have attended trade shows and have continued our relationships with our customer list, which comprises manufacturers, dealers and end users. We also receive unsolicited orders by telephone, fax or the internet. In addition, we have sought relationships with architectural engineering firms and municipalities that are implementing projects requiring parking barrier gates, such as municipal parking lots and airport reconstruction. Although we have not maintained a full-time sales force for this business, we have engaged an outside consultant.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete primarily on the basis of style, color, product breadth and quality, as well as price and customer service.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

The principal raw materials for our coated fabrics are casting paper, knit fabric, PVC plastic resins, pigments and plasticizers. We have multiple sources for most of these materials. We believe that in the few instances where we have a sole supplier we can re-engineer around the sole-sourced materials if necessary with minimal effort and cost.

&#160;

Concentration of Customers 

&#160;

The only customer that accounts for ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues is Lear Corporation. Of our global sales in 2015, 63% was contributed by our top 25 customers. Our largest customer contributed 14% to our total sales in 2015.

Employees 

&#160; 

We believe that we maintain a stable, experienced and productive workforce, currently employing a total of 415 employees.

&#160;

Most of our employees who are involved in the production process are located at manufacturing facilities in Stoughton, Wisconsin and Earby, England. The production employees at the Stoughton, Wisconsin facility are represented by Local 1207 of the United Steel Workers (formerly P.A.C.E.). The term of the pending collective bargaining agreement for Stoughton represented employees extends to March 2023. Most of the employees at our Earby facility are represented by UNITE. The collective bargaining agreement with UNITE does not specify a termination date.

&#160;

Twelve of our executive and corporate employees work in our executive office in Sarasota, Florida, and our domestic automotive sales support employees work in our sales office in Nappanee, Indiana.

&#160;

Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on Our Business 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing processes are subject to increasingly stringent regulation by environmental, health and safety authorities. It is difficult to predict future changes in environmental, health and safety regulations on our future financial results. Continued compliance could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities, arising out of a release of regulated material, discovery of previously unknown conditions, more aggressive enforcement actions or new requirements, could adversely affect our financial results.

&#160;

&#160;

Our safety sensor product is subject to regulation of radio frequency (RF) by the Federal Communications Commission. Our safety sensor product has FCC Certification but is not UL certified. On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry. This rule, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows. Manufacturers of gates and operators that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification to be significant could require that our product be certified by UL. The absence of UL certification could present a barrier to sales to potential customers.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to develop new products, manufacturing processes, systems and technologies, while reducing costs to customers and enhancing existing product lines. We believe that investment in research and development has been an important factor in establishing and maintaining our competitive position in many of the specialized niche markets in which our products are sold. Product performance capabilities and characteristics are continually adjusted to meet customer needs.

&#160;

In-house design and innovative product development are key features of our business. Our in-house design studio enables us to develop new designs for customers and then deliver them in sample form or by computer-aided design (CAD).

&#160;

We have access to a vast range of grain, prints and surface effects, which are constantly evolving and increasing. Further trends are captured and expressed in our own concept work and exclusive designs are developed from customer requests. Our CAD systems allow fast creation and display of design innovation. &#8220;Drape&#8221; software enables computer generated designs to be shown in situ in interiors of vehicles before the expense of production is incurred. A silicone cast surface-modeling system permits the transfer of material surface finishes, including leather and fabrics, onto vinyl foils for customer review before investment in tooling. Diverse production systems and equipment create an extensive automotive product range. Hi-Loft and anti-squeak finish (ASF) are examples of product developments providing customers with cost reduction and material performance enhancements.

&#160;

We spent $1,728,867 in 2015 and $1,527,589 for research and development in 2014.

&#160;

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We have not needed to make any material expenditure to maintain such compliance during the past two fiscal years, nor do we anticipate having to make any material expenditure to maintain such compliance in the foreseeable future.

&#160;

We aim to comply with all existing regulatory legislation at European, national and local levels and adopt a positive stance in anticipating future, more stringent regulatory requirements. We endeavor to minimize waste throughout the production facilities with better utilization of raw materials, energy and water and to prevent at the source the emission of pollutants into the environment. We are committed to continual improvements in environmental performance.
