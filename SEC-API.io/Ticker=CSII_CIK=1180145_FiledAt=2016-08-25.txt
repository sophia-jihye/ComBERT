&#160; 

In addition to the Peripheral and Coronary OAS, we intend to expand our product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies. We offer multiple accessory products required for use with the Peripheral and Coronary OAS. Sales of accessory products, primarily guide wires, represented 8% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 . 

In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 device and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize our products in Europe. 

In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (&#8220;PMDA&#8221;) for approval of our Diamondback 360 &#174; &#32;Coronary OAS Micro Crown, our second generation coronary device. Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI product and would represent a significant milestone for us. We are currently evaluating potential distribution partners in Japan. 

We will continue to evaluate options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities. 

Market Overview 

Peripheral Artery Disease 

Peripheral artery disease typically refers to the chronic obstruction of the arteries supplying the lower extremities due to plaque deposition on the walls of the arteries resulting in inadequate blood flow to the limbs. The anatomy of lower extremity arteries varies by location: arteries above the knee are generally long, straight and relatively wide compared to arteries below the knee, which tend to be shorter, more tortuous, and branch into progressively smaller in diameter arteries distally. The most common early symptoms of PAD are pain, cramping, or fatigue in the leg or hip muscles while walking, which typically subsides at rest. Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the leg, foot, or toes while resting. As PAD progresses, additional signs and symptoms occur, including cooling or color changes in the skin of the legs or feet. If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia (&#8220;CLI&#8221;), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive. CLI may lead to large non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death. Within the first year of diagnosis, an estimated 25 to 30% of CLI patients will die and 30% will undergo amputation (&#8220;ACC/AHA 2005 Guidelines for the Management of 

Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease,&#8221; Hirsch et al, 2005). CLI results in an estimated 160,000 amputations per year in the United States. 

According to estimates by the American Heart Association, as many as 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD. In addition, there are two other primary references used for estimating PAD prevalence: the patient Ankle Brachial Index (&#8220;ABI&#8221;) and the diabetes method. The most recent comprehensive study, based on ABI, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 8.5 million (Allison et al, &#8220;Ethnic-Specific Prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in the United States,&#8221; Circulation, 2007). Alternatively, a study by The SAGE Group, based on the diabetes method, estimated prevalence at 17.6 million in 2010 (The SAGE Group, &#8220;The Diabetes Method,&#8221; 2011). An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD. In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat. Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging. Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association in 2011 lowered the recommended age for testing for PAD from 70 to 65, or 50 if the patient has a history of smoking or diabetes. As these guidelines are incorporated into physician practice, PAD diagnosis rates are forecasted to increase. Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs. While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstructions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes. As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention. 

Coronary Artery Disease 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States and is a life-threatening condition. CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, 15.4 million people in the United States suffer from CAD, the most common form of heart disease. Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year. According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients, and severe calcium affects up to 20% of patients, undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (&#8220;PCI&#8221;). Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events (&#8220;MACE&#8221;). 

Our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS 

Our orbital atherectomy systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives. The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an offset diamond-coated crown. The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and results in lower use of bail out stents, and many physicians also use OAS to prepare vessels for the use of drug coated balloons. The coronary device is used to treat severe calcium prior to stent delivery to facilitate stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts. The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall. The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as &#8220;differential sanding.&#8221; The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown. Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel. In addition, the crown's rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy. These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery. 

Components of the OAS &#32; 

Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wires and is powered by saline infusion pumps that also help cool the system and remove debris. The Peripheral OAS reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries. Similarly, the Coronary OAS uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery. 

Catheter. The catheter for our OAS consists of: 

&#8226; 

a control handle, which allows movement of the crown and predictable crown location; 

&#8226; 

a flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown, which tracks and orbits over the guide wire; and 

&#8226; 

a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area. 

ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire, ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire. The ViperWire guide wires were designed to offer an improved ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions. The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire. 

ViperSlide Lubricant. &#32;&#32;ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS. 

OAS Pump. The saline infusion pump mounts directly to the intravenous pole and bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter. The constant flow of saline during orbit reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates. 

The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the eccentrically mounted crown as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel. As the speed of the crown's rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown's radius of orbit and presses the diamond-coated crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit. The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment. The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables: 

&#8226; 

Speed. &#32;&#32;An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels. Our Peripheral OAS allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds. Our Coronary OAS allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds. 

&#8226; 

Crown Characteristics. &#160; The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond particles. The Peripheral OAS crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid. Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity. Physicians often use the classic or micro crown configuration in small, more tortuous vessels or when less aggressive sanding is desired. The solid crown configuration is designed with a tapered, leading edge for frontal sanding, which can be used in tight calcified disease. The Peripheral OAS is available with a 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter classic crown, and a 1.25 millimeter, 1.50 millimeter and 2.00 millimeter solid crown configuration. There is also a 1.25 millimeter micro crown available with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral device, which allows physicians options to treat very small arteries in the lower leg and foot. Catheter lengths are 145 centimeters and 60 centimeters, which address procedural approach and target lesion locations both above and below the knee and ankle. Varying catheter lengths allow physicians options to treat via retrograde pedal approach in addition to the common femoral artery access point. The Peripheral OAS is versatile, and by adjusting the speed in conjunction with crown selection, multiple lesions and vessel sizes can be treated. The crown for the Coronary OAS is available in one configuration: 1.25 millimeter classic. 

Centrifugal force propels the crown outward against the arterial wall as the crown rotates. This force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall, and the guidewire. Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow. If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, minimizing the engagement of the diamond-grit and protecting the integrity of the healthy tissue. Diseased tissue is less flexible or non-compliant and provides resistance to the centrifugal force, which generates an opposing force that enables the diamond-coated crown to engage and sand the plaque. The sanded plaque is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient's natural blood flow. 

Peripheral OAS testing performed in carbon blocks, animal and cadaver models showed: 

&#8226; 

greater than 93% of particles were smaller than a red blood cell, and 

&#8226; 

greater than 99% of particles were smaller than the lumen of the capillaries (which provide the connection between the arterial and venous system). 

Coronary OAS testing performed in a carbon block model showed: 

&#8226; 

98.3% of particulate is smaller than a red blood cell; and 

&#8226; 

&#8776; 2 microns in size. 

The small particle size and short treatment time minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow. The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages. 

We believe the OAS offers the following key benefits: 

Strong Safety Profile 

&#8226; 

Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events . The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, non-compliant plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue. Arteries are composed of three tissue layers (from inside to out): the intima, media, and adventitia. The eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown. Furthermore, the OAS has rarely penetrated the media (middle) or adventitial (outer) layers of the artery's wall. The Diamondback 360 Peripheral's perforation rate was 0.7% during our CONFIRM trial. Analysis by an independent pathology laboratory of more than 434 consecutive cross sections of porcine arteries treated with the Stealth 360 Peripheral revealed there was minimal to no damage, on average, to the media or associated lamina, which implies preservation of the media during treatment. Similarly, the perforation rate was 1.8% during our pivotal coronary ORBIT II trial, with 0.9% perforations device related. Analysis by an independent core-lab of more than 443 patients enrolled in the ORBIT II Trial revealed 4 patients had a perforation after the OAS treatment and another 4 patients had a perforation after stent deployment, for a total of 8 perforations reported. 

&#8226; 

Eliminates Need for Distal Protection. &#32;The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices. The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream. 

&#8226; 

Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure. &#32;&#32;The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting. Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage. 

&#8226; 

Benefits of Smaller Sheaths. The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS portfolio is uniquely compatible with 4 French (&#8220;Fr&#8221;) to 6Fr sheaths (1.25mm crowns - 4Fr, 1.5mm crowns - 5Fr, 2.00mm crowns - 6Fr). Centrifugal force enables the OAS to treat large vessels through small sheaths; for example, it can treat up to 5mm vessel through a 4Fr sheath. Smaller sheaths may be associated with less femoral bleeding, shortened post-procedure ambulation time and reduced radiation exposure. In addition, the primary complication in peripheral interventions is a vascular access site complication. Access site complications were shown to be 41.4% more frequent in procedures where 7Fr or 8Fr sheaths were used compared to 4Fr to 6Fr (4.5% vs. 3.2%, p &#60; 0.001). Exchanging to a larger sheath has been shown to be the strongest predictor of bleeding complication during peripheral interventions. 

Proven Efficacy 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Efficacy Demonstrated for Both Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. &#32;&#32; 

&#9702; 

Peripheral OAS - Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS. Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began. Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS successfully met the study endpoints. Because the Predator 360 and Stealth 360 mechanism of action is identical to that of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS, no additional efficacy trials were required by the FDA for 510(k) clearance of either of those systems. 

&#9702; 

Coronary OAS &#32;- Our pivotal ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating de novo &#32;severely calcified coronary lesions. The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins. Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the Coronary OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both peri-procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population. The pre-procedure mean minimal lumen diameter of 0.5 mm increased to 2.9 mm after the procedure. The primary safety endpoint was 89.6% freedom from 30-day MACE compared with the performance goal of 83%. The primary efficacy endpoint (residual stenosis &#60;50% post-stent without in-hospital major adverse cardiac events) was 88.9% compared with the performance goal of 82%. Stent delivery was successful in 97.7% of cases; &#60;50% stenosis was observed in 98.6% of subjects. Low rates of in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.7%), cardiac death (0.2%), and target vessel revascularization (0.7%) were reported, as well as 1-year outcomes with target lesion revascularization (&#8220;TLR&#8221;) (4.7%) and TLR in the drug-eluting stent subset (3.4%). ORBIT II patients were tracked out to three years, demonstrating long term durable results with a low TLR rate of 7.8% and TLR in the drug eluting stent subset of 6.6%. 

&#8226; 

Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions. &#32;&#32;The OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee. In the coronaries, the OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions. To date, the Coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions. 

&#8226; 

Orbital Motion Improves Lesion Compliance. &#32;&#32;The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding, while the centrifugal motion of the eccentrically mounted crown creates pulsatile forces. Compliance change is achieved by sanding away superficial plaque, which also creates an open lumen, and by modification or fractionation of deeper plaque by delivering pulsatile forces into the vessel wall. Together, these mechanistic components sufficiently remove or modify hard plaque, allowing for low pressure balloon inflation. The orbital motion and speed of the eccentrically mounted crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque with pulsatile forces, as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices. 

&#8226; 

Differential Sanding Creates Smooth Lumens. &#32;&#32;The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth surface lumen, or channel, inside the vessel. We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or re-narrowing of the arteries. 

Ease of Use 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Utilizes Familiar Techniques. &#32;&#32;Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques. The devices' simple user interfaces require minimal additional training. 

&#8226; 

Single Access Site to Complete Treatment. &#32;&#32;Centrifugal force unique to OAS allows for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases. In the coronary arteries, Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device able to treat 2-4mm vessels with one device through a 6Fr radial approach. In the peripheral vasculature, the OAS device is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites. 

&#8226; 

No Need for Collection Reservoir. Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, which adds time and cost to the procedure. 

Multiple Applications 

&#160; 

The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations. 

&#8226; 

Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely diseased, calcified or both. Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer. Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee 

bends or flexes. The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels, as demonstrated in our CALCIUM 360&#176; randomized clinical trial, where 100% of the lesions treated with the Peripheral OAS were located below the knee. The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4 French catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot). 

&#8226; 

Above-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels. Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific. Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee. 

&#8226; 

Coronary Artery Disease. &#32;&#32;The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or have a family history of heart disease. Once CAD occurs, a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device indicated for severe coronary calcium. 

Cost and Time Efficient Procedure 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Short Procedure Time. &#32;&#32;The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes in coronary procedures. 

&#8226; 

Single Crown Can Treat Various Lumen Sizes Limiting Hospital Inventory Costs. &#32;&#32;The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery. Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions. 

&#8226; 

Single Access Site May Reduce Procedural Time. &#32;&#32;Since the physician can treat multiple arteries through a single access site, this reduces the risk of bleeding complications that can occur during arterial access, ultimately reducing patient recovery time. 

&#8226; 

Retrograde Access Treatment Option Benefits.. Many of the patients treated with the Peripheral OAS have advanced PAD and suffer from Critical Limb Ischemia. These patients often have complex, calcified lesions in their lower leg, which are challenging to access and treat using the traditional femoral artery access site. If left untreated, these cases may result in lower limb amputation. CSI&#8217;s family of 1.25mm Peripheral OASs with 4Fr compatibility allows for more options to treat those lesions by providing a low-profile system that is fully compatible with alternative access sites in the foot or ankle. Smaller sheaths have been shown to reduce procedure times and decrease complications. 

Our OAS Strategy &#32; 

Our goal is to be the leading provider of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease. The key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Drive Adoption through Our Direct Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders. &#32;&#32;We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists. As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating physicians about the disease state and our clinical data, and training physicians regarding the proper use and application of OAS technology through physician faculty, our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices. 

&#8226; 

Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS. &#32;&#32;Physicians and payers are increasingly requesting clinical and economic evidence to allow them to make decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients. We are focused on collecting clinical and economic evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS in treating complex disease states such as peripheral and coronary artery disease. We believe that the clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of our OAS technology will help drive physician utilization of the OAS and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices. 

&#8226; 

Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries. &#32;&#32;In addition to enhancing the OAS, we have expanded our product portfolio. We offer multiple accessory devices for use with the OAS. We are continuing product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions. 

&#8226; 

International Expansion. CE Mark was granted for the Stealth 360 device in October 2014 and we have applied for regulatory approval for the next generation coronary OAS device in Japan. We are evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities. Sales channels will be based on specific country dynamics. As a result, distributors, including potential strategic partners, and direct sales channels are being evaluated. 

&#8226; 

Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships . In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to continue to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives. We also intend to explore distribution agreements, licensing transactions, and other strategic partnerships. 

Research and Development Activities 

Clinical Studies Summary 

We continue to study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients. A total of 5,698 subjects (4,740 PAD and 958 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2016. Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes. Both the PAD and CAD studies illustrate the versatility of our technology and our focus on improving the standard of care. 

We have completed numerous clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS, including our OASIS (pivotal study for clearance of the Peripheral OAS), CONFIRM post market registries (CONFIRM I, II, and III), CALCIUM 360&#176;, COMPLIANCE 360&#176;, and TRUTH. The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the Peripheral OAS provides predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate it from other PAD treatments. We recently completed enrollment in the LIBERTY 360&#176; study and began enrollment in the OPTIMIZE BTK study. 

The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2016: 

&#8226; 

TRUTH. &#32;&#32;This post-market, prospective, single-arm study utilized intravascular ultrasound (&#8220;IVUS&#8221;) imaging and angiography to assess procedural outcomes in twenty-five subjects with symptomatic PAD treated with orbital atherectomy and adjunctive balloon angioplasty. The independent IVUS Core Lab analysis demonstrated that the orbital atherectomy device modified the calcified component of the plaque burden. At twelve months, the target lesion revascularization rate was 8.2%. The final TRUTH study results were published in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery &#32;(October 2015). 

&#8226; 

LIBERTY 360&#176; . This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study will evaluate the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD. We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease (Rutherford 6). Enrollment of over 1,200 subjects at 51 sites in the United States was recently completed. LIBERTY 360&#176; baseline demographic data for the first 600 patients was presented in a late-breaking presentation at the International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy (February 2016). The LIBERTY 360&#176; interim demographic analysis showed that the prevalence of diabetes and renal disease increased significantly as the PAD disease state progresses from Rutherford 2-3 (Claudicant) to Rutherford 6 (CLI). In addition, the data seems to indicate racial disparity in PAD/CLI treatment, which warrants further investigation. LIBERTY 360&#176; subjects will be followed for up to five years. 

&#8226; 

OPTIMIZE BTK. This post-market, multi-center, randomized clinical study conducted in Europe will evaluate the acute and long-term clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy with adjunctive drug-coated balloon (&#8220;DCB&#8221;) angioplasty versus DCB angioplasty alone in PAD patients with calcified, below-the-knee lesions. Fifty evaluable subjects will be enrolled in OPTIMIZE BTK and will be followed for up to two years. 

CAD, the most common form of heart disease, continues to affect more patients worldwide. Percutaneous coronary intervention of calcified lesions is associated with procedural complications, stent malapposition, and high revascularization and MACE rates. We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study. The Coronary OAS Micro Crown device is currently under investigation in the COAST study. The following CAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2016: 

&#8226; 

ORBIT II. &#32;This prospective, multi-center, single-arm Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown in treating de novo , severely calcified coronary lesions and enrolled 443 subjects at 49 US sites. Two year ORBIT II study results were recently published in Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (April 2016). The final ORBIT II 3-year data was presented at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions conference in a featured clinical research presentation (May 2016). The overall 3-year MACE rate was 23.5%, including 6.7% cardiac death, 10.2% target vessel revascularization, and 11.2% myocardial infarction. 

&#8226; 

Coronary Flow Reserve. &#32;This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, post-market study will evaluate coronary flow reserve after treatment with the Coronary OAS Classic Crown and stenting of de novo, severely calcified coronary lesions. Enrollment of the fifteen subjects was completed in May 2016. Study results are pending following completion of analysis. 

&#8226; 

COAST . This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global IDE study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the next-generation Coronary OAS Micro Crown in treating patients with severely calcified lesions. CSI completed COAST enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the United States and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, in July 2015. The 30-day study results were presented at the Cardiovascular Research Technologies conference in a late-breaking presentation (February 2016). In the COAST study, successful stent delivery was achieved in 99.0% of the subjects and 30-day freedom from MACE was 85.0%. 

Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment. A number of upcoming clinical studies are in the development phase and will begin enrolling in the near future. Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market. 

Development Activities 

Our product research and development activities are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that serve the peripheral and coronary vascular disease space, with emphasis towards high margin products and complex arterial disease states treated by our primary customers. The focus and value proposition of our products is to enable positive acute and long-term clinical outcomes, with efficiency and predictability, in challenging patient subsets. 

Research and development resources have been strategically allocated between opportunities that maximize the clinical effectiveness and user satisfaction of our OAS product line and the development of additional products that offer portfolio diversification and incremental revenue opportunities. 

Specific to the peripheral vascular disease market, we will continue our commitment to patients suffering from CLI through a breadth of above-the-knee and below-the-knee differentiated products that treat or uniquely expand the ability of our devices to treat obstructive lesions throughout the leg and foot. Most recently, we launched the Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral, a line of next generation low profile orbital atherectomy devices that enable physicians to intervene through 4Fr and 5Fr access sheaths. Low profile devices offer numerous benefits, including a reduction in access site complications, improved device deliverability, compatibility with alternative access sites and a reduction in post-procedure time to ambulation. Specific to the coronary vascular disease market, we are building a portfolio of differentiated products that are used to treat complex CAD. We are currently seeking FDA and Japanese PMDA approval of a next generation coronary OAS that utilizes a micro crown design and distal tip sanding surface that aid in crossing sub-total occlusion lesions. Emphasis in both franchises is placed on novel and differentiated devices that address unmet or under-met clinical or technical needs. 

Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;were $25.9 million , $31.0 million &#32;and $21.1 million , respectively. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Revenues for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;were $178.2 million , $181.5 million &#32;and $136.6 million , respectively. We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and cutting or laser atherectomy. Peer-to-peer education is also a key element of our sales strategy. 

We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials. Our sales and marketing program focuses on: 

&#8226; 

clinical results showing safety and efficacy of our products; 

&#8226; 

educating physicians on the prevalence and complications of calcium in PAD and CAD; and 

&#8226; 

developing relationships with key opinion leaders. 

Manufacturing &#32; 

&#160; 

We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS. Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced. We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component. We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility. Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers. 

We are located in a new, 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota. This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities. Depending on staffing, the new facility has the capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift annually. The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products. 

Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly. The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift annually. This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps. 

We believe that our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will provide adequate production, assembly, and warehousing capacity for the foreseeable future. 

We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU. We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2018. Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE Mark. Our Stealth 360 has received CE Mark. We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due by June 2021. 

Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing &#32; 

&#160; 

Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States. The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS. In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. Consequently, Medicare's coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations. 

CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products. We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician's services. 

Competition &#32; 

&#160; 

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Our OAS devices compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott 

Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson &#38; Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic. We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Medtronic, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific and Philips, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. We are not aware of any competing high-speed rotational atherectomy systems either currently on the market or in development that also generate an orbital motion with an eccentric solid abrasive crown to create lumens with diameters that are larger than the diameter of the abrasive crown itself. 

Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products. We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of: 

&#8226; 

safety and efficacy, even in calcified plaque; 

&#8226; 

low profile and alternative access site capabilities; 

&#8226; 

predictable clinical performance; 

&#8226; 

availability of clinical data; 

&#8226; 

ease of use; 

&#8226; 

economic benefit; 

&#8226; 

key opinion leader support and customer base; and 

&#8226; 

customer service and support. 

Patents and Intellectual Property &#32; 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. As of June 2016, we held 53 issued U.S. patents and have 52 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 276 issued or granted foreign patents and 158 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2016 and 2032, and our most important patents, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,890 and two key design patents covering our eccentric abrasive crown technology, are due to expire on June 1, 2019, February 16, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively, though we will pursue patent term extensions on the basis of regulatory delay where appropriate. In addition, we have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO, which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly. Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings. As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices. In addition, we hold 18 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and eight registered marks in Hong Kong. We have three trademark applications pending in the U.S., eight trademark applications pending in Canada and 12 trademark applications pending in India. 

We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. 

Government Regulation of Medical Devices 

Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. 

Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products. 

United States 

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries. 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA. The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device - 510(k) clearance or PMA - is generally linked to classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device&#8217;s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;). Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to a device that is already legally marketed. 

Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing. The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process. 

510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. 

After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 

We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the United States on August 22, 2007. We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral on November 9, 2007. We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011. We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Micro in November 2013 and the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral in February 2014. The Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral received FDA clearance in April 2015. We received clearance of the ViperWire Advance Flex Tip Guide Wire in June 2015. The Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral and Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral were granted 510(k) clearance in October 2015. 

Premarket Approval. A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture 

the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA&#8217;s QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 

FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 

&#8226; 

the systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 

&#8226; 

the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements; and 

&#8226; 

changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application. Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought. The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use. 

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

The FDA granted unconditional IDE approval in April 2010 to begin the ORBIT II coronary trial in the United States. This pivotal trial was set up in two phases: Phase I allowed us to enroll up to 100 patients at as many as 50 U.S. sites, and Phase II allowed us to expand the trial to the full complement of 429 patients. In May 2011, we received approval from the FDA to complete enrollment of 429 patients in our ORBIT II clinical trial for a coronary application for the Diamondback 360, which followed the FDA&#8217;s review of data from the first 50 cases in the ORBIT II trial. In July 2012, we received approval from the FDA to include the new electric coronary device (similar to Stealth 360 technology used in PAD and customized specifically for the coronary application), which improves ease of use. The FDA required 100 enrollments with the new electric coronary device and would have allowed up to 50 additional patients in the trial, as needed, to achieve that enrollment level. A total of 443 patients were enrolled in the trial. In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our OAS to treat calcified coronary arteries. In October 2013, we received approval from the FDA to market the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries and subsequently commenced a controlled commercial launch of the Coronary OAS. In 2014, we initiated the COAST study, an IDE clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the next-generation Coronary OAS in treating patients with severely calcified lesions. We completed COAST enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the United States and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, in July 2015. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials. &#160; Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. 

FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation. 

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice. Good clinical practices include the FDA&#8217;s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good clinical practices also include the FDA&#8217;s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators. 

Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial (or a change to a previously approved protocol or trial that requires approval), or place a clinical trial on hold; 

&#8226; 

patients do not enroll in clinical trials or follow up at the rate expected; 

&#8226; 

patients do not comply with trial protocols or experience greater than expected adverse side effects; 

&#8226; 

institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol or changes to the trial protocol; 

&#8226; 

third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreements, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; 

&#8226; 

third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; 

&#8226; 

regulatory inspections of the clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require corrective action or suspension or termination of the clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; 

&#8226; 

the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or 

&#8226; 

the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 

Continuing Regulation. After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#8226; 

establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing; 

&#8226; 

the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes; 

&#8226; 

labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities; 

&#8226; 

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur; 

&#8226; 

corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and 

&#8226; 

product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health. 

In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions: 

&#8226; 

warning letters or untitled letters; 

&#8226; 

fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 

&#8226; 

product recall or seizure; 

&#8226; 

unanticipated expenditures; 

&#8226; 

delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products; 

&#8226; 

withdrawal or suspension of FDA approval; 

&#8226; 

orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund; 

&#8226; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; or 

&#8226; 

criminal prosecution. 

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR. 

The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Fraud and Abuse 

Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs. In addition, these laws require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not &#8220;debarred&#8221; by the federal government and, therefore, prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

On May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) stating that it is investigating us to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act. On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the &#8220;OIG&#8221;), and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ&#8217;s investigation (the &#8220;Civil Action&#8221;), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action, with no admission of liability. In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG. See Item 3 of this Form 10-K for additional information on this matter. 

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals. 

Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals. In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels. 

International Regulation 

International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the EU, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. The EU has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a &#8220;Notified Body.&#8221; This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one&#8217;s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. 

As noted above, in July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (&#8220;PMDA&#8221;) for approval of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown. Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI product. As part of our anticipated Japan commercialization process we will be subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the &#8220;PMD Act&#8221;). Our quality management system and products will be subject to review and examination by PMDA and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The critical suppliers named in our application will also be subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us. Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment. 

In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws. 

Environmental Regulation 

Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota. There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 , we had 581 employees, including 130 employees in manufacturing, 323 employees in sales and marketing, 65 employees in general and administrative, and 63 employees in research and development, all of which are full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
