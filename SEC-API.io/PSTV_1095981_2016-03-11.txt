General

&#160;

We develop cellular therapeutics uniquely formulated and optimized for specific diseases and medical conditions and related products. Our lead therapeutics are currently targeted for impaired hand function in scleroderma, osteoarthritis of the knee, stress urinary incontinence, and deep thermal burns including those complicated by radiation exposure.

&#160;

Our cellular therapeutics are collectively known by the trademarked name, Cytori Cell Therapy TM , and consist of a mixed population of specialized cells including stem cells that are involved in response to injury, repair and healing. These cells are extracted from an adult patient&#8217;s own adipose (fat) tissue using our fully automated Celution &#174; System device, proprietary enzymes, and sterile consumable sets at the place where the patient is receiving their care or potentially at an off-site processing center. Cytori Cell Therapy can either be administered to the patient the same day or cryopreserved for future use. An independent published study has reported that our proprietary technology process resulted in higher nucleated cell viability, less residual enzyme activity, less processing time, and improved economics in terms of cell progenitor output compared to the three other semi-automated and automated processes that were reviewed.

&#160;

Lead Program &#38; Development Pipeline 

&#160;

Our primary near-term goal is for Cytori Cell Therapy to be the first cell therapy to market for the treatment of impaired hand function in scleroderma, through Cytori-sponsored clinical development efforts. The STAR trial is a 48-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase III pivotal clinical trial of 80 patients in the U.S. The trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Cytori Cell Therapy (ECCS-50) in scleroderma patients affecting the hands and fingers. The first sites for the scleroderma study were initiated in July 2015. Approximately 25% of patients were enrolled in the STAR trial by the end of January 2016.

&#160;

With respect to the remainder of our clinical pipeline, we received Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2014 for our phase II ACT-OA osteoarthritis study and in early 2015 we initiated this study, and enrollment was completed in June 2015. In addition, in July 2015, a Company-supported male stress urinary incontinence (SUI) trial in Japan for male prostatectomy patients (after prostate surgery) received approval to being enrolled from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to gain regulatory approval in Japan of our Cytori Cell Therapy for this indication. In addition, we are developing a treatment for thermal burns combined with radiation injury under a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We are also exploring other development opportunities in a variety of other conditions.

&#160;

In addition to our targeted therapeutic development, we have continued to commercialize the Celution &#174; System under select medical device approvals, clearances and registrations to research and commercial customers in Europe, Japan, and other regions. Many of these customers are research customers evaluating new therapeutic applications of Cytori Cell Therapy. The sale of systems, consumables and ancillary products contributes a margin that partially offsets our operating expenses and will continue to play a role in fostering familiarity within the medical community with our technology. These sales have also facilitated the discovery of new applications for Cytori Cell Therapy by customers conducting investigator-initiated and funded research.

Lead Indication: Scleroderma

Scleroderma is a rare and chronic autoimmune disorder associated with fibrosis of the skin, destructive changes in blood vessels and multiple organ systems as the result of a generalized overproduction of collagen. Scleroderma affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. (women are affected four times more frequently than men) and is typically detected between the ages of 30 and 50. More than 90 percent of scleroderma patients have hand involvement that is typically progressive and can result in chronic pain, blood flow changes and severe dysfunction. The limited available treatments for scleroderma may provide some benefit but do little to modify disease progression or substantially improve symptoms. Treatment options are directed at protecting the hands from injury and detrimental environmental conditions as well as the use of vasodilators. When the disease is advanced, immunosuppressive and other medications may be used but are often accompanied by significant side effects.

&#160;

In January 2015, the FDA granted unrestricted IDE approval for a pivotal clinical trial, named the &#8220;STAR&#8221; trial, to evaluate Cytori Cell Therapy as a potential treatment for impaired hand function in scleroderma. The STAR trial is a 48-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trial of 80 patients in the U.S. The trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Cytori Cell Therapy (ECCS-50) in scleroderma patients affecting the hands and fingers. The STAR trial plans to use the Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS), a validated measure of hand function, as the primary endpoint measured at six months after a single administration of ECCS-50 or placebo. Patients in the placebo group will be eligible for crossover to the active arm of the trial after all patients have completed 48 weeks of follow up. In February 2015, the FDA approved our request to increase the number of investigational sites from 12 to up to 20. The increased number of sites is anticipated to broaden the geographic coverage of the trial and facilitate trial enrollment. The enrollment of this trial began in August 2015 and we recently reported that we enrolled 20 patients and expect to complete enrollment of this trial in mid-2016.

&#160;

The STAR trial is predicated on a completed investigator-initiated pilot phase I/II trial performed in France termed SCLERADEC I. The SCLERADEC I trial received partial support from Cytori. The results were published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases in May 2014 and demonstrate approximately a 50 percent improvement at six months across four important and validated endpoints used to assess the clinical status in patients with scleroderma with impaired hand function. Patients perceived their health status to be improved as shown by a 45.2% and 42.4% decrease of the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) at month 2 (p=0&#8226;001) and at month 6 (p=0&#8226;001), respectively. A 47% and 56% decrease of the CHFS at month 2 and month 6 in comparison to baseline was observed (p&#60;0&#8226;001 for both). Grip strength increased at month 6 with a mean improvement of +4.8&#177;6.4 kg for the dominant hand (p=0.033) and +4.0&#177;3.5 kg for the non-dominant hand (p=0.002). Similarly, an increase in pinch strength at month 6 was noted with a mean improvement of +1.0&#177;1.1 kg for the dominant hand (p=0.009) and +0.8&#177;1.2 kg for the non-dominant hand (p=0.050). Among subjects having at least one digital ulcer (DU) at inclusion, total number of DU decreased, from 15 DUs at baseline, 10 at month 2 and 7 at month 6. The average reduction of the Raynaud&#8217;s Condition Score from baseline was 53.7% at month 2 (p&#60;0.001) and 67.5% at month 6 (p&#60;0.001). Hand pain showed a significant decrease of 63.6% at month 2 (p=0.001) and 70% at month 6 (p&#60;0.001). One year results were recently published in the journal Rheumatology. Relative to baseline, the CHFS and the SHAQ improved by 51.3% and 46.8% respectively (p&#60;0.001 for both). The Raynaud&#8217;s score improved by 63.2% from baseline (p&#60;0.001). Other findings include a 30.5% improvement in grip strength (p=0.002) and a 34.5% improvement in hand pain (p=0.052). In February 2016, two-year follow up data in the SCLERADEC I trial was presented at the Systemic Sclerosis World Congress, which demonstrated sustained improvement in the following four key endpoints: Cochin Hand Function Score (CHFS), Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire, Raynaud&#8217;s Condition Score (which assesses severity of Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon), and hand pain, as assessed by a standard visual analogue scale. The &#160; major findings at 24 months following single administration of Cytori Cell Therapy&#8482; (ECCS-50) were as follows : 

&#160;

&#160; &#183;

Hand dysfunction assessed by the CHFS, showed a 62% reduction in hand dysfunction at two years (p&#60;0.001).

&#183; Raynaud&#8217;s Condition Score decreased by an average of 89% over baseline at two years (p&#60;0.001). 

&#183; Hand pain, as measured by a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale, and the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) score at two years both showed improvement of 50% over baseline (p=0.01 and p&#60;0.001 respectively). 

&#183; Improvement of 20% in grip strength and 330% in pinch strength at two years (p=0.05 and p=0.004 respectively) 

&#183; Continued reduction in the number of ulcers from 15 at baseline to 9 at one year and 6 at two years. 

&#160;

In 2014, Drs. Guy Magalon and Brigitte Granel, under the sponsorship of the Assistance Publique des H&#244;pitaux de Marseille, submitted a study for review for a follow-up phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in France using our Celution Cell Therapy, to be supported by Cytori, called SCLERADEC II. Patients will be followed for 6 months post-procedure. The trial was approved by the French government in April 2015. Enrollment of this trial commenced in October 2015.

&#160;

In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with Idis Managed Access, part of Clinigen Group plc (&#8220;Idis&#8221;), to establish a managed access program, or MAP, in select countries across EMEA for patients with impaired hand function due to scleroderma. We established this MAP, also known as a &#8220;compassionate use,&#8221; early access&#8221; or &#8220;named patient&#8221; program, to make our ECCS-50 therapy available to patients in advance of obtaining regulatory clearance. We believe this MAP program is justified and needed based on a number of apparent circumstances, including scleroderma&#8217;s status as a rare disease, the favorable risk-benefit profile reported by the 12-patient, open-label SCLERADEC I clinical study results, our two hand scleroderma phase III trials currently enrolling, and clear unmet scleroderma patient needs. We hope to offer our ECCS-50 therapy to patients who are unable to participate in our scleroderma clinical trials, generally due to a lack of geographic proximity to a site. Beyond the benefit of helping patients in need of new therapies for scleroderma, the MAP will increase awareness of and facilitate a positive experience with Cytori Cell Therapy among healthcare providers in advance of commercialization, and will also allow for tracking and collection of key program data and documentation which will provide valuable insight regarding the demand for and use of Cytori Cell Therapy.

&#160;

In April 2015, the European Commission, acting on the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, issued orphan drug designation to autologous adipose derived stromal vascular cells (ECCS-50) processed with the Celution System for systemic sclerosis. This designation marks the first autologous adipose derived cell therapy to be designated orphan drug status in Europe for scleroderma.

Osteoarthritis

&#160;

Osteoarthritis is a disease of the entire joint involving the cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and underlying bone. The breakdown of tissue leads to pain, joint stiffness and reduced function. It is the most common form of arthritis and affects an estimated 13.9% of US adults over the age of 25, and 33.6% of adults over the age of 65. Current treatments include physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, viscosupplement injections, and total knee replacement. A substantial medical need exists as present medications have limited efficacy and joint replacement is a relatively definitive treatment for those with the most advanced disease.

&#160;

In the later part of 2014, we received approval by the FDA to begin an exploratory U.S. IDE pilot (phase IIa/b) trial of Cytori Cell Therapy in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The trial, called ACT-OA, is a 94 patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo control study involving two dose escalations of Cytori Cell Therapy, a low dose and a high dose, and will be conducted over 48 weeks. The randomization is 1:1:1 between the control, low and high dose groups. Enrollment on this trial began in February 2015 and was completed in June 2015 . The goal of this proof-of-concept trial is to help determine: (1) safety and feasibility of the ECCO-50 therapeutic for osteoarthritis, (2) provide dosing guidance and (3) explore key trial endpoints useful for a phase III trial.

&#160;

A pre-specified partial unblinding and top-line analysis of 24 week data was recently completed. The objective of the analysis was to provide early data to facilitate key regulatory and business development discussions and provide better understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of action that may impact other clinical programs. The interim top-line data shows the following:

&#183; The randomization is relatively balanced among the three treatment groups; low dose, high dose, and placebo. 

&#183; Intra-articular application of a single dose of ECCO-50 appears to be safe and feasible in an outpatient day-surgery setting. No complications occurred related to the fat harvest, cell processing or cell delivery. 

&#183; A significant placebo response was observed, similar to that demonstrated in other OA trials. 

&#183; The pre-specified primary endpoint, pain on walking at 12 weeks, as measured by a single question from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) did not obtain statistical significance. 

&#183; Key secondary endpoints include the total and sub-scores of the KOOS, patient self-assessments (knee pain, knee stability, osteoarthritis activity and osteoarthritis damage), use of as-needed pain medication, pain while walking 50 feet and health status as measured by the SF-36. Consistent trends were observed suggesting improvement in the cell treated group relative to the placebo group at the 12 and 24 week time periods for patient reported outcomes; however, in general, between-group differences were small. 

&#183; Both high dose and low dose of ECCO-50 performed similarly. 

&#160;

In the 3 rd quarter of 2016, following full unblinding of the 48 week data, the Company will be able to fully evaluate the data including 48 week follow up, patient subset analyses, and the effect on knee cartilage as measured by magnetic resonance imaging results changes between baseline and 48 weeks.

&#160;

Stress Urinary Incontinence

&#160;

Another therapeutic target under evaluation by Cytori in combination with the University of Nagoya and the Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare is stress urinary incontinence in men following surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is based on positive data reported in a peer reviewed journal resulting from the use of adipose-derived regenerative cells processed by our Celution System. The ADRESU trial is a 45 patient, open-label, multi-center, and single arm trial that has recently been approved by Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and is being led by both Momokazu Gotoh, MD, Ph.D., Professor and Chairman of the Department of Urology and Tokunori Yamamoto, MD, Ph.D., Associate Professor Department of Urology at Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. The goal of this investigator-initiated trial will be to apply for product approval for Cytori Cell Therapy technology for this indication. This clinical trial is primarily sponsored and funded by the Japanese Government. Enrollment of this trial began in September 2015.

Cutaneous and Soft Tissue Thermal and Radiation Injuries

Cytori Cell Therapy is also being developed for the treatment of thermal burns combined with radiation injury. In the third quarter of 2012, we were awarded a contract to develop a new countermeasure for thermal burns valued at up to $106 million with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service&#8217;s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The initial base period included $4.7 million over two years and covered preclinical research and continued development of Cytori&#8217;s Celution&#174; System to improve cell processing.

In 2014, an In-Process Review Meeting was held at which Cytori confirmed completion of the objectives of the initial phase of the contract. In August, 2014, BARDA exercised contract option 1 in the amount of approximately $12 million. In December this was supplemented with an additional $2 million. This funded continuation of research, regulatory, clinical, and other activities required for submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) request to the FDA for a pilot clinical trial using Cytori Cell Therapy (DCCT-10) for the treatment of thermal burns. Upon receipt of IDE approval to execute this pilot clinical trial, we anticipate that BARDA will provide funding to cover costs associated with execution of the clinical trial and related activities, currently estimated at approximately $8.3 million.

&#160;

Our contract with BARDA contains two additional options to fund a pivotal clinical trial and additional preclinical work in thermal burn complicated by radiation exposure. These options are valued at up to $45 million and $23 million respectively.

The total award under the BARDA contract is intended to support all clinical, preclinical, regulatory, and technology development activities needed to complete the FDA approval process for use in thermal burn injury under a device-based PMA regulatory pathway and to provide robust preclinical data in burn complicated by radiation exposure.

Other Clinical Indications

Heart failure due to ischemic heart disease does not represent a clinical target at this time and the Company intends to minimize expenses related to its initiatives in this area. The ATHENA and ATHENA II trials, which sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of Cytori Cell Therapy in patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease, were truncated and we intend to use the data from these trial programs for regulatory support for our other indications and also for publication in peer reviewed forums.

&#160;

Regulatory Developments

&#160;

China Regulatory Clearance

&#160;

In April 2015, one of our exclusive licensees, Lorem Vascular Pty. Ltd, was granted regulatory clearance for the Cytori Celution &#174; System by the State Food and Drug Administration of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (CFDA). This regulatory clearance officially makes our Celution System available in the largest healthcare market in the world and triggered a 2015 product purchase order for the Company from Lorem Vascular which was partially fulfilled in 2015.

&#160;

EU Orphan Designation

&#160;

In April 2015, the European Commission, acting on the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, granted an orphan drug designation to Assistance Publique Hopitaux du Marseille (France), the sponsor institution for the SCLERADEC I and trials using Cytori Cell Therapy, for autologous adipose derived regenerative cells for the treatment of systemic sclerosis.

&#160;

In December 2015, Cytori submitted an expanded application for orphan medicinal product (OMP) designation for autologous adipose tissue-derived regenerative cells for the treatment of systemic scleroderma. We believe that we will be granted orphan designation in the first half of 2016, whereupon we will promptly approach appropriate representatives of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to seek protocol assistance with respect to our ECCS-50 development program in Europe for scleroderma. This protocol assistance will better inform us as to the EMA&#8217;s view of our position statements regarding our ECCS-50 therapy and facilitate our efforts to obtain full marketing authorization for our ECCS-50 therapy under the EMA&#8217;s centralized procedure.

Sales &#38; Marketing

Cytori Cell Therapy TM 

A majority of Cytori&#8217;s product revenue in 2015 was derived from sales of our devices and consumables in Japan. New cell therapy regulations in Japan have reduced regulatory uncertainties and provided greater clarity for the Company moving forward. Besides revenue, these sales provide strategic value for us through the investigator relationships that are built, clinical data that is compiled and the global visibility generated. In Europe, Celution &#174; System has CE mark approval for select indications. Our European customers include hospitals and clinics as well as researchers performing investigator-initiated and funded studies. One of these customers, Odense University Hospital in Denmark, published results from an open-label, single-arm erectile dysfunction study in February 2016. In April 2015, one of our exclusive licensees, Lorem Vascular Pty. Ltd, was granted regulatory clearance for the Cytori Celution &#174; System by the State Food and Drug Administration of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (CFDA). This regulatory clearance officially makes our Celution System available in the largest healthcare market in the world and triggered a 2015 product purchase order for the Company from Lorem Vascular. In July 2015, another of our exclusive licensees, Bimini Technologies, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration conditional Investigational Device Exemption approval to conduct a clinical trial, STYLE, studying the safety and feasibility of its technology for the treatment of female and early male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia). The STYLE Phase II clinical study is approved to enroll up to 70 patients at up to 8 centers within the United States. Patients have been enrolled and treated at 2 sites as of January 2016.

&#160;

Cytori Cell and Tissue Banking

We currently market Cytori Cell and Tissue Banking to hospitals, clinics, tissue banks, and stem cell banking companies worldwide through a combination of distributors and direct sales. The solution encompasses three configurations that are available on a regionally specific basis: cell banking, cell and adipose tissue banking, or adipose tissue banking alone. We remain responsible for manufacturing and sourcing all necessary equipment, including but not limited to cryopreservation chambers, cooling and thawing devices, cell banking protocols and the proprietary software and database application.

Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of geographical concentration of sales.

Customers and Partners

In Japan, Europe, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America we offer Cytori Cell Therapy and Cytori Cell and Tissue Banking through direct sales reps, distributors, and partners, to hospitals, clinics, and researchers, including for purposes of performing investigator-initiated and funded studies.

Pursuant to our Sale and Exclusive License/Supply Agreement (&#8220;Bimini Agreement&#8221;) with Bimini Technologies LLC (&#8220;Bimini&#8221;), we granted Bimini a global exclusive license to our devices and consumable products for hair applications. Bimini&#8217;s focus is on the aesthetics cash-pay market. Through Kerastem, its wholly owned subsidiary, Bimini is conducting an FDA-approved phase II clinical trial in the United States for Kerastem&#8217;s solution for female and male pattern baldness, and in parallel is engaged in market development activities in Europe and Japan. The Kerastem Hair Therapy is CE mark approved for patients with alopecia (hair loss) outside the United States. Under the Bimini Agreement, Bimini is required, among other things, to pay an eight percent (8%) royalty on its net sales of our products for contemplated hair applications. 

&#160;

Pursuant to our Amended and Restated License/Supply Agreement with Lorem Vascular (the &#8220;Lorem Agreement&#8221;) we granted Lorem Vascular an exclusive license in all fields of use (excluding hair applications subject to Bimini&#8217;s license) to our products for sale into China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. Under the Lorem Agreement, Lorem Vascular committed to pay up to $500 million in license fees in the form of revenue milestones. In addition, Lorem Vascular is required to pay us 30% of their gross profits in China, Hong Kong and Malaysia for the term of the Lorem Agreement. Lorem Vascular has certain minimum product purchase obligations, including purchase obligations triggered by achievement of regulatory clearance for our products in China, which regulatory clearance was achieved in April 2015. Lorem Vascular has partially satisfied these related product purchase obligations, and as a result, we are currently in discussions with Lorem Vascular regarding restructuring of its obligations and our rights under the agreement. We cannot guarantee that our restructuring discussions with Lorem will be successful. Should we be unable to conclude these negotiations to our satisfaction, a dispute may ensue. See, also, our discussions of the regulatory landscape in China for our products as well as discussions regarding our relationship with Lorem Vascular in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and in the &#8220;Competition&#8221; and &#8220;Governmental Regulation&#8221; sections of this &#8220;Business&#8221; section below.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

Our products are currently manufactured at the Company&#8217;s headquarters in San Diego, CA and in Wales, United Kingdom. Our manufacturing capabilities are expected to enable us to meet anticipated demand in 2016. We are, and the manufacturer of any future therapeutic products would be, subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners. The manufacturer of devices and products for human use is subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the FDA for compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, such as our Notified Body in Europe.

Most of the raw materials required to manufacture the Celution &#174; System family of products are commonly available from multiple sources, and we have identified and executed supply agreements with our preferred vendors. Some specialty components are custom made for us, and we are dependent on the ability of these suppliers to deliver functioning parts or materials in a timely manner to meet the ongoing demand for our products. In particular, our Celase and Intravase reagents, which are used to digest patients&#8217; autologous adipose (fat) tissue, are manufactured exclusively by Roche Diagnostics Corporation, or Roche. We do not have a second qualified supplier to manufacture these reagents. Though we have significant inventory related to these reagents on hand which we believe are sufficient to satisfy anticipated internal and customer demand for a period of approximately 19 months, if our agreement with Roche were to terminate or if Roche were otherwise unable to manufacture sufficient volumes of the reagents to meet our customer demand, our business could be materially and adversely affected. The initial term of our agreement with Roche will expire December 31, 2020 and will continue thereafter for additional five-year renewal period. 

&#160;

There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate quantities of the necessary raw materials supplies within a reasonable time or at commercially reasonable prices. Interruptions in supplies due to price, timing, or availability or other issues with our suppliers could have a negative impact on our ability to manufacture products.

Competition

The field of regenerative medicine is expanding rapidly, in large part through the development of cell-based therapies and/or devices designed to isolate cells from human tissues. As the field grows, we face, and will continue to face, increased competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and governmental agencies in the United States and abroad. Most regenerative medicine efforts involve sourcing adult stem and regenerative cells from tissues such as bone marrow, placental tissue, umbilical cord and peripheral blood, and skeletal muscle. However, a growing number of companies are using adipose tissue as a cell source. We exclusively use adipose tissue as a source of adult stem and regenerative cells.

With the growing number of companies working in the cell therapy field, we are forced to compete across several areas, including equity and capital, clinical trial sites, enrollment of patients in clinical trials, corporate partnerships, skilled and experienced personnel and commercial market share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources than we do. We cannot with any accuracy forecast when or if these companies are likely to bring cell therapies to market for indications such as scleroderma, osteoarthritis, and thermal burns which we are also pursuing.

Companies researching and developing cell-based therapies for our lead indications include, but are not limited to, Anterogen, Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, Cellular Biomedicine Group, Osiris Therapeutics, Regeneus Ltd, Stempeutics, TiGenix NV, Vericel Corporation., Cyfuse Biomedical and Medicon. These companies are in various stages of clinical development for their respective cell therapies. In addition, we are aware of several surgeons who are performing autologous fat transfers using manual methods, some of whom enrich the fat with autologous adipose-derived cells. In 2014, the FDA released several guidances which are anticipated to limit the availability of non-FDA approved cell therapies including those derived from adipose tissue. FDA has issued specific guidance on the use of cells from adipose tissue. Specifically, FDA has indicated that the process of separating the stromal vascular fraction from adipose tissue is considered a regulated process and such cells are considered drugs that would need FDA oversight prior to use on humans. It is these same stromal vascular cells that are produced by the Celution device. Since Cytori has previously initiated a regulatory pathway with FDA that is consistent with this new public announcement (PMA pathway for Celution System), the regulatory impact to Cytori is minimal and confirmatory in nature. However, the regulatory impact for Cytori competitors is unknown as the full impact of these new FDA guidelines are not known. In Europe, we anticipate that our Celution Cell Therapy will be regulated as an advanced-therapy medicinal product, or ATMP, which is essentially a drug classification. As our combination of Celution system platform and Cytori Cell Therapy output (autologous, same surgical procedure) is novel, we intend to work with the European Medicines Agency and its appropriate subcommittees to discuss our product offering and confirm our regulatory approval pathway. Competitors with product offerings more clearly categorizable as drugs in the EU may face fewer regulatory hurdles and/or have quicker pathways to regulatory approval. In Japan, Celution Cell Therapy is approved as a Class I medical device which means it can be sold and used in Japan but without any specific claims or receive reimbursement. Facilities who use our products must 1) certify their facility and 2) receive approval for the protocols through the process outlined in the November 2014 Regenerative Medicine Law. Product approval for Celution Cell Therapy for specific indications (including reimbursement) are outlined in the Japan Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act, or PMD Act, which has provisions for Drugs, Devices and Regenerative Medicine Products. Celution Cell Therapy can be approved as either a Device or Regenerative Medicine Product. The organization is in the process of determining the optimal pathway(s).

In China, our Celution device and our proprietary enzymes (Celase and Intravase) have Class 1 clearances, which means they can be sold into China for research purposes without any specific claims or receive reimbursement. However, cell therapies in China are subject to significant regulation, and we are currently dependent on the efforts of Lorem Vascular to navigate the regulatory landscape to successfully commercialize our technology in China. Competitors with product offerings that are further advanced in the regulatory process or that face fewer regulatory restrictions in China may have quicker pathways to commercial access and success.

We expect to compete based on, among other things, the clinical safety, clinical efficacy, regulatory approvals, and cost effectiveness of our solutions . We also believe the newly announced FDA policies on the isolation and selection of stromal vascular fraction cells from adipose cells are favorable for Cytori Celution System given the fact that Cytori had previously initiated a regulatory pathway that is consistent with these new FDA announcements.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses were $19,000,000, $15,105,000 and $17,065,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These expenses have supported the basic research, product development and clinical activities necessary to bring our products to market.

Our research and development efforts in 2015 focused predominantly on the following areas:

&#183; Supported enrollment in the ACT-OA (osteoarthritis) and STAR (scleroderma) trials; 

&#183; Supported ongoing preclinical and other research activities towards BARDA contract milestones; 

&#183; Continued patient follow-up and data analysis from the Athena trials and European ADVANCE trial; 

&#183; Prepared and submitted multiple regulatory filings in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other regions related to various cell and tissue processing systems under development; 

&#183; Developed new configurations and expanded functionality of our Celution &#174; platform to address the current Japan approval as a medical device (Japan Class I) and other markets; 

&#183; Conducted adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRC) viability and transport studies in support of clinical trial requirements; 

&#183; Conducted, presented, and published research efforts related to ADRC characterization and potency to further establish scientific leadership in the field; and 

&#183; Continued to optimize and develop the Celution &#174; System family of products and next-generation devices, single-use consumables and related instrumentation. 

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including the Celution&#174; System product platform, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.

To protect our proprietary medical technologies, including the Celution&#174; System platform and other scientific discoveries, Cytori has over 80 issued patents worldwide. We have 24 issued U.S. patents and 58 issued international patents. Of the 24 issued U.S. patents, 2 were issued in 2015. Of the 58 issued international patents, 4 were issued in 2015. In addition, we have over 45 patent applications pending worldwide related to our technology. We are seeking additional patents on methods and systems for processing adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, on the use of adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells for a variety of therapeutic indications, including their mechanisms of actions, on compositions of matter that include adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, and on other scientific discoveries. We are also the exclusive, worldwide licensee of the Regents of the University of California&#8217;s rights to a portfolio related to isolated adipose derived stem cells, which includes one US patent and twelve foreign patents. We are seeking additional patents on methods and systems for processing adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, on the use of adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells for a variety of therapeutic indications, including their mechanisms of action, on compositions of matter that include adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, and on other scientific discoveries. We are also the exclusive, worldwide licensee of the Regents of the University of California&#8217;s rights to a portfolio related to isolated adipose derived stem cells, which includes one US patent and twelve foreign patents.

We cannot assure that any of our pending patent applications will be issued, that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable, that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, we cannot assure that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around our patents. U.S. patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using.

&#160;

There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and declared invalid or infringing of third party claims. For many of our pending applications, patent interference proceedings may be instituted with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO&#8217;s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us. Third parties can file post-grant proceedings in the USPTO, seeking to have issued patent invalidated, within nine months of issuance. This means that patents undergoing post-grant proceedings may be lost, or some or all claims may require amendment or cancellation, if the outcome of the proceedings is unfavorable to us. Post-grant proceedings are complex and could result in a reduction or loss of patent rights. The institution of post-grant proceedings against our patents could also result in significant expenses.

Patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the U.S. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors&#8217; patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently have pending patent applications or issued patents in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, Canada, China, Korea, and Singapore, among others.

In addition to patent protection, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques, somehow gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise or disclose such trade secrets, or that we can ultimately protect our rights to such unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.

Government Regulation

As medical devices that yield cells with therapeutic potential, our products must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from the European Union, the FDA and, from other applicable governments prior to their sale.

Our current and future Celution&#174; Systems are, or will be, subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the design/development process, clinical testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, and promotion of medical devices and drugs. Included among these regulations are pre-market clearance and pre-market approval requirements, design control requirements, and the Quality System Regulations/Good Manufacturing Practices. Other statutory and regulatory requirements govern, among other things, registration and inspection, medical device listing, prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration, labeling and post-market reporting.

The Celution&#174; System family of products must also comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which the products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. International government regulations vary from country to country and region to region. For example, regulations in some parts of the world only require product registration while other regions/countries require a complex product approval process. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby, creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing and cell banking technology products.

&#160;

Worldwide, the regulatory process can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain with no guarantee of approval. Before any new medical device may be introduced to the U.S. market, the manufacturer generally must obtain FDA clearance or approval through either the 510(k) pre-market notification process or the lengthier pre-market approval application (PMA) process, which requires clinical trials to generate clinical data supportive of safety and efficacy. Approval of a PMA could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated due to the requirement for clinical trials. Our core Celution&#174; System processing device products under development are generally subject to the lengthier PMA process for many specific applications. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings, fines, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspensions of production, withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances, refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications, and criminal prosecution.

Specifically, regulation of the Celution&#174; System in Europe and the U.S. for use in various diseases such as scleroderma require that we conduct clinical trials to collect safety and efficacy data to support marketing approvals. Our collaborators in France have completed a pilot study in Europe for hand manifestations in scleroderma. We completed a pilot study for chronic myocardial ischemia in Europe and based on the data are seeking a limited approval in Europe. In the U.S., we are currently conduction an 80 patient study STAR for hand manifestations in scleroderma under the device regulations via the PMA pathway.

Regulations in Asia Pacific are currently evolving for cell therapy products. For example, Japan has recently enacted a regenerative medicine law in November of 2014 following sweeping changes in the medical device regulations in 2014. In China, the regulatory landscape for cell therapies such as ours is subject to increasing regulation, and success in this market will depend heavily on a firm understanding of applicable regulations and a commitment to pursuing appropriate regulatory approvals, including any required approvals from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, or NHFPC, and other governmental entities. To the extent that Lorem Vascular is unable or unwilling to pursue and obtain necessary regulatory approvals, existing regulations in Chain regarding cell therapies may serve to hamper commercialization efforts for our technology. In part because of perceived challenges in addressing the Chinese market, we have engaged in discussions with Lorem Vascular Pty, Ltd., or Lorem Vascular, our exclusive licensee in China, regarding restructuring of our agreement. No assurance can be given that our discussions with Lorem Vascular will be successful or that Lorem Vascular will be able to successfully execute its current business strategy in China. These regulatory uncertainties further complicate the regulatory process in Asia Pacific and may lengthen approval timelines and / or market entrance / penetration.

Medical devices are also subject to post-market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury, and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If safety or effectiveness problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the product. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the 510(k) process or approved through the PMA process may require further FDA review through new 510(k) or PMA submissions. 

We must comply with extensive regulations from foreign jurisdictions regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for marketing and authorization may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme in the United States.
