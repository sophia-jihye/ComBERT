 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

ID Global Solutions Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), is a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity management and electronic transaction processing services. Founded to pioneer innovative digital identification solutions, the Company is focused on addressing the growing need for highly secure and convenient methods for identity management during a variety of electronic transactions. The Company provides its biometric identification services to government and public sector organizations, seeking to verify and manage identities for a variety of security purposes, including issuing identity cards and exercise of rights such as voting in elections. With the acquisition of MultiPay S.A., or MultiPay, the Company acquired a transaction processing platform that offers secure multifunctional payment gateway services to merchants and financial institutions. With the development of the OnePay TM electronic payment solution the Company believes it will be able to combine its core technologies and use its platform to power a solution that will provide cost effective and secure means of financial inclusion for the un-banked and under banked population around the globe.

&#160;

The Company is continuing to develop secure biometric identity management and electronic transaction solutions for international and domestic government, enterprise, and consumer markets. The Company&#8217;s products focus on two distinct yet complementary requirements, for which the Company believes there is significant market demand. One is the broad requirement for identity, access and transaction verification and associated identity management needs. The other is for providing cost effective and secure methods of conversion of cash and paper to electronic payments for the un-banked and under banked population, to enable them to participate in the digital economy there by facilitating financial inclusion. The Company has invested in developing, patenting and acquiring both hardware and software platforms, which are intended to address these specific market requirements.

&#160;

Management believes that one of the advantages of the Company&#8217;s platform approach is the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets in both the identity management and payment processing sectors and could be easily adapted to new markets requiring low cost, secure, and configurable solutions. These vertical markets include but are not limited to border security, public safety, enterprise security, payment transactions and banking. The Company&#8217;s recent launch of unattended kiosks providing electronic ticketing for public transportation in Colombia, is a further example of the innovative solutions that the Company can offer. In addition, if the OnePay, closed loop, electronic payment service is successfully launched, the Company believes that it can be a cost effective solution for providing the un-banked access to secure electronic payment solutions. In this way the Company believes that the various technologies that the Company is developing and has acquired can be combined into a single offering, which at its core can facilitate the processing of electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or identity verification. 

&#160;

The Company has solutions for fingerprint based identity management and electronic transaction processing in the market today. However, it is still in the process of integrating the technologies, which it has developed with those acquired via MultiPay and transactions completed in the last year and expanding these solutions to be able to better service our target markets. In order to achieve this integration and development, the Company needs to raise substantial additional capital.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 21, 2011, and our common stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol &#8220;IDGS&#8221;. Our corporate headquarters is located at 160 E. Lake Brantley Drive, Longwood, Florida 32779 and our main phone number is (407) 951-8640. We maintain a website at www.idglobal.com . The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K

&#160;

Global Market Opportunity 

&#160;

We believe that there are several market trends that drive growth in the identity management and payment processing industries, including growing concerns over identity theft and fraud and the increase in electronic payments, in particular solutions provided by non-bank entities.

&#160;

While an increasingly digital world drives convenience, it also drives an increasing risk of compromised passwords, security breaches and stolen identities. With every online purchase, e-bill payment and download of new travel, dining and gaming &#8216;apps&#8217; to a mobile smartphone, consumers&#8217; digital identity expands. In 2014, the US e-commerce marketplace suffered over $4 billion in fraud affecting card-not-present payment cards and this figure is projected to more than double by 2020. (Source: The Nilson Report). To combat fraud and to better confirm customers&#8217; identities, we see an increasing deployment of biometric solutions in the marketplace. In their 2015 report, Goode Intelligence forecast that by 2020 over 1.1 billion financial services customers will be using mobile biometrics to access and secure their accounts, and more than 16 billion mobile biometric payment transactions will be made.

&#160;

Despite heightened awareness of digital security from the recent FBI and Apple iPhone legal battle, access to these services and thus our identities are still secured only through a common username/password. In the United States, the most common and powerful &#8220;password&#8221; to confirm identity is still the social security number, which recent hacks of Government databases have shown is very vulnerable to being stolen. Governments, institutions and enterprises concerned with security have therefore become concerned to find more secure ways to verify identity and manage the identities of the persons with whom they need to interact, be they employees, customers, authorized users or citizens.

&#160;

Electronic payments of all forms have continued to grow at a healthy rate. According to the World Payments Report 2015, published by CapGemini and Royal Bank of Scotland, global non-cash transaction volumes increased by 7.6% in 2013, while in Latin America the increase was 8.6% and in Central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) the rate was 10.6%. More significantly, the report highlighted the importance of what it describes as the &#8220;hidden payments&#8221; market, namely payments undertaken by means of closed loop cards and mobile apps, digital wallets offered by non-banks, mobile money offered by non-banks and virtual currencies. The authors estimate that these payment methods represented anywhere up to 10.5% of the electronic payments market in 2013 and they expect this sector to grow.

&#160;

The key drivers for these alternative payment methods are consumer demands for convenient and faster payment transactions, the gaps in the existing value propositions offered by the banks mainly because of legacy systems and regulatory constraints, which can stifle innovation and the inability of many consumers to access the banks&#8217; traditional payment services. In a growing electronic payments market, these alternative payment methods are therefore perceived by the industry as an important route for both innovation and financial inclusion.

&#160; 

Our Solutions and Products 

&#160; 

The Company to date has invested $323,480 in patenting IP, for software and hardware development of its core technologies and in acquiring additional technologies which are intended to provide solutions in the following areas: Identity Management include (1) handheld identification devices and (2) biometric finger print matching algorithms and associated software applications; Payment Processing include (3) multi-factor out of band authentication platform software and services, and (4) a multi-application electronic transaction software platform with open and closed loop payment application capability. The Company&#8217;s investment to date, only include the amounts incurred after the Company determined that its software attained technological feasibility and was a working model which was ready for commercialization.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s product lines in these areas (which are in various stages of development as discussed below) comprise the following:

&#160;

Identity Management 

&#160;

&#8226; Front-end application software for fingerprint capture, and image processing as well as a back-end fingerprint matching software solution with its own proprietary algorithms (includes IDSearch TM product). &#160;

&#8226; Biometric handheld device designed to be used for Government and enterprise security and identity management applications (HDR &#174; ) &#160;

&#8226; Out-of-band authentication platform, which is designed to provide the private and public sector a secure, convenient federated application for universal identity verification during electronic transactions (IDComplete TM ). &#160;

&#8226; Secure plastic and credential card products CardPlus products recently acquired). &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Payment Processing 

&#160;

&#8226; Multi-application payment gateway and switch that provides payment solutions for online retailers and physical merchant locations (Tranxa TM ). The gateway functionality includes support for EMV credit card acceptance, cash or credit based bill pay services and cash or credit based pre-paid top-up services for cellular operators. In addition, Tranxa has the ability to electronically transfer funds between locations of licensed network operators. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Closed loop financial payment solution operating on the gateway platform, intended to offer a secure and inexpensive solution for conducting electronic payment transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-to peer payments (OnePay TM ). &#160;

&#8226; Unattended kiosks providing electronic ticketing for transit systems (PaySpot TM ). &#160;

The Tranxa gateway platform operates in Colombia and also powers the Company&#8217;s services to the Colombian Post Office 4/72, providing bill payment and money transmission to its customers. The PaySpot unattended kiosk solution was recently launched for the Bogota Transit Authority. The IDSearch solution and credentialed card products were acquired in 2016 as part of the FIN Holdings Inc., or FIN acquisition and are being used by customers in the United States and South Africa, respectively.

&#160;

The Company is approximately 80% complete in its development of the ID Complete platform associated with secure out-of-band authentication and the development of the OnePay closed loop financial payment solution, by expansion of the MultiPay platform. These platforms leverage the technologies the Company acquired through its acquisitions of MultiPay S.A. in Colombia and FIN Holdings in the United States.

&#160;

In 2012, the Company was selected to provide over 33,000 handheld Voter Verification terminals for the Presidential Elections in Ghana Africa. This contract was successfully delivered in December 2012 and the related warranty period completed in December 2013. The Company believes that these hardware IP and designs can complement its software and platform solutions for government security solutions, national ID programs and payment processing. The funding required to go from the current stage of development on our HDR platform to a final product is estimated to be $275,000.

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

With the recent acquisitions, of MultiPay (2015) and FIN (2016), the Company has acquired not only innovative technology, but existing products, revenues and a customer base upon which the Company can build. We seek to extend our position and execute our business plan by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative security and payment services to our customers that help them achieve their operational or business goals. The execution of our strategy is subject to our obtaining sufficient additional working capital to finance the various initiatives discussed, whether through investment or otherwise. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.

&#160;

Focus on existing customer base 

&#160;

To ensure its current products and solutions are properly positioned in the market, the Company has established dedicated sales and marketing teams in the United States, Colombia and South Africa. These teams are focused on supporting the already existing indirect distribution channels in their respective regions as well as to identify and secure new partners and customers.

&#160;

Cross sell to existing customers 

&#160;

The Company is examining opportunities to offer its new platform capabilities and solutions to existing customers. For example, the opportunity exists to offer the OnePay solution to a customer that is using the MultiPay gateway for money transmission. Tokenization of transactions is also a secure processing methodology that has numerous applications across different customer use cases. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that combine our identity management technology with our payment processing capabilities, and thereby, have a more complete offering for customers that are ultimately using only one of those services.

&#160;

Add new customers 

&#160;

The Company plans to grow its core business through focused sales and marketing of its current products and solutions, as well as its newly developed platforms and solutions. The sales and marketing teams referenced above are also tasked with developing additional distribution channels and seeking out new customers.

&#160;

Enter new markets 

&#160; 

By virtue of the recent acquisitions the Company has already entered new markets in Colombia and South Africa. The Company believes that the solutions that are currently, being offered and developed in those countries will be suitable to be similarly offered in other emerging markets in the Latin American and African regions. Furthermore, the improvements to the Company&#8217;s platforms and the expansion of the sales teams are being undertaken with a view to being able to support transaction processing and customers across borders, without the need to establish and build new facilities in each new country, thereby reducing the costs of entry into each new market. There are no current plans to expand into new countries at this time.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Innovation 

&#160;

As the electronic and cybersecurity industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We also believe it will be critical to our growth for us to continue to enhance our platform capabilities. We believe the development of new services and solutions will be an important revenue source in the future, and enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities. A key offering recently launched is our unattended kiosk solution. Today we offer a low operating cost alternative for transportation providers to accept money and provide electronic ticketing for their services. The Company believes that our out-of-band authentication technology can be combined with unattended kiosks to offer similar low operating cost solutions for account enrollment in a variety of business verticals, without the need for physical presence. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that address some of today&#8217;s major global market challenges and opportunities surrounding identity management and by combining them with our payment processing capabilities, to facilitate financial inclusion for the un-banked.

&#160;

Select Acquisitions 

&#160;

As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology and capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.

&#160;

Strategic Partners and Suppliers 

&#160;

The Company believes that strategic partnerships will be a major component of the Company&#8217;s operating strategy and path to success. The Company intends to work with several strategic partners in important areas of its business and operations. Currently, the Company has several strategic partners (noted below) and plans to foster additional such relationships.

&#160;

A key supplier of the Company is Flextronics, an outsourced contract hardware manufacturer, that manufactured the HDR devices. Flextronics provided a turnkey managed solution, including full maintenance. Pursuant to the Company&#8217;s relationship with Flextronics, the Company expects it will be able to obtain assembly and manufacturing of parts and products via Flextronics&#8217; manufacturing capabilities.

&#160;

In 2014, the Company established a business relationship with a Kiosk manufacturer, Slabb Inc., for the production of a Multi-modal Biometric Enrolment and Verification Kiosks as well as for un-attended Transit Ticketing Kiosks. No formal agreement is in place, beyond a standard Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Company can utilize these services on an as needed basis. The Company purchased the first final production Multi-Modal Biometric Kiosk from this manufacturer in May 2014 and has received delivery of the unit in June 2014. In addition, the Company has purchased 80 un-attended Transit Ticketing kiosks from this manufacturer in September 2015 and received full delivery of all units in December 2015.

&#160;

The Company may from time to time make investments by way of a minority equity stake in businesses, which we consider will be complementary to the Company&#8217;s activities, with a view to expanding the market for the Company&#8217;s products and services and creating additional opportunities for cross-selling, or in businesses which have complementary technologies.

&#160;

Sales and Distribution Agreements 

&#160;

The Company has established business relationships with sales agents, distribution partners and others to promote and sell the Company&#8217;s products. The Company has sales and distribution agreements with companies in Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

The Company has conducted limited advertising and marketing to date. The Company has, however, given substantial attention to constructing the marketing strategy and plans that it will use in order to grow its business and expand its customers. The Company anticipates that it will eventually need a significant budget for marketing activities. The primary focus of marketing campaigns will be designed to help the Company find new customers and to increase awareness of the Company&#8217;s products and platform.

&#160;

The Company expects that its sales team will work closely with the marketing team to convert prospects into new customers. The sales team will be structured to align with target markets based on territory.

Revenue Model 

&#160;

Identity Solutions and Products 

&#160;

The biometric fingerprint solutions are priced based on an annual licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system. The Company expects to provide its new platform service for out-of-band authentication based on a subscription model, based on tiered fees per enrolled user, card or device. The Company&#8217;s HDR Intelligent Accessory products and the CardPlus plastic and credentials card products will be sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product. The biometric fingerprint solutions product has been commercialized and has generated revenues in 2015. The HDR technology products are in the client evaluation / commercialization phase and did not produce revenues in 2015. CardPlus did not produce revenues until 2016, in conjunction with the FIN acquisition described below.

&#160;

Payment Processing Solutions and Products 

&#160; 

The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction basis. The pricing for the Company&#8217;s new closed loop financial payment platform is expected to be based on a combination of transaction fee and percent of transaction value model. MultiPay currently uses this technology and, as a result, was able to generate revenue during 2015.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The identification management and payment processing industries are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. The Company will need to consistently develop and improve products in order to remain competitive in the technology industry.

&#160;

Several competitors exist for the Company&#8217;s current and planned products and platform services relating to identification management including MorphoTrak, Gemalto, SuperCom, SecureKey, Authy and other new entrants into the market. Each competitor has a unique and different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some provide out-of-band authentication; most only provide in-band authentication. We do not believe that there is any competitor which can offer both systems, in the manner that the Company intends. Some competitors are manufacturers who provide systems or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems. These system or platform solutions do allow the Company&#8217;s competitors to offer other products.

&#160;

The payment processing industry has a large number of competitors who provide gateway services, end-to-end, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. In Colombia we compete against those technology companies, as well as acquiring banks and payment processors offering payment solutions to online and brick and mortar merchants.

&#160;

While the Company will take steps to protect and maintain its intellectual property and competitive designs, there is no guarantee that such intellectual property protection and competitive designs can safeguard against the rapid technological changes and innovation that characterize the industries in which we operate.

&#160;

In addition, it is possible that other technology companies could develop competing technology and products. Many of our competitors are much larger organizations that typically have larger sales, marketing and R&#38;D budgets, more financial, technical customer support and other resources, greater brand recognition and the ability to hire talented personnel to more quickly develop and commercialize new products. There are no assurances the Company will ever be able to compete in its target markets.

&#160; 

Acquisitions 

&#160;

On April 6, 2015, the Company closed on a Share Purchase Agreement (the &#34;Purchase Agreement&#34;) with all of the shareholders (the &#34;MultiPay Shareholders&#34;) of MultiPay S.A., a Colombian corporation (&#34;MultiPay&#34;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MultiPay (the &#34;MultiPay Shares&#34;) from the MultiPay Shareholders on a fully diluted basis. In consideration for the MultiPay Shares, the Company will issue and sell to the MultiPay Shareholders an aggregate of 7,600,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company has issued approximately 6,100,000 shares of common stock to the MultiPay Shareholders upon closing of the transaction. Upon the MultiPay Shareholders paying certain liabilities in the approximate amount of US $370,000, the Company is required to deliver the balance of approximately 1,500,000 shares of common stock to the MultiPay Shareholders. In the event the MultiPay Shareholders do not pay the required amount by November 2016 (the extended due date), the Company will not be required to deliver the remaining shares of common stock. To date approximately $47,800 has been paid and a six month extension of the 1,500,000 share claw back been granted. Multipay, through the use of its own proprietary software platforms, is engaged in providing an array of value added payment gateway services as well as complimentary mobile wallet applications and services to various customers in Colombia and Peru. MultiPay was established in December of 2008 and has 14 full time employees based in Bogota, Colombia.

&#160;

On February10, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of FIN Holdings Inc. (&#34;FIN&#34;), a related party via common management and partial common ownership, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, ID Solutions Inc., a Delaware Corporation specializing in field proven, cutting-edge biometric fingerprint software technology and algorithms, as well as Cards Plus Pty Ltd, a South African company which provides unique secure credential products and solutions to government customers in Africa. The purchase price of $9,000,000, which was paid in the form of common stock of the Company, will result in the issuing 22,500,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to the FIN shareholders. The acquisition enhances the Company&#8217;s current Transaction Security and Financial Inclusion platforms with highly accurate, fully integrated biometric fingerprint verification and backend matching capabilities. Recently tested by the U.S. Government National Institute of Standards, ID Solutions' proprietary fingerprint technology performed in certain cases ahead of other leading fingerprint biometric companies from around the world. This biometric technology has also been successfully deployed by the U.S. government as a back office AFIS solution that is used to ensure the identity of transportation workers throughout the country, as well as in U.S. commercial markets and by other governments worldwide in order to verify identity and secure physical and digital access. With the addition of the CardsPlus portfolio of physical cards and card personalization solutions, the Company can now provide government and commercial customers with a complete solution for their identity programs and financial payment systems.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The Company licenses certain technology for use in its products and business. A key arrangement is the license of materials from Apple, Inc. The license, executed in October 2009, provides the Company with the ability to use certain Apple, Inc. materials in the Company&#8217;s own products.

&#160;

The Company also holds numerous patents and intellectual property as a result of an assignment of the same to the Company in November 2012 by Thomas Szoke, Daniel Fozzati and Andras Vago. Each of these individual assignors now beneficially own shares of common stock in the Company (as a result of the IIM Acquisition, since these individuals were formerly shareholders of Innovation in Motion). The Company has capitalized $1,627,555 of Intellectual Property, the breakdown of which can be seen in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

The following is a summary of the patents and patent applications as well as the trademarks that the Company has filed throughout the world:

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company&#8217;s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.

&#160;

Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company&#8217;s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company could become subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company&#8217;s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.
