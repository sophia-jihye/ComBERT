 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We deliver information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) and services to help healthcare organizations achieve better clinical, financial and operational results. Our solutions are sold to physicians, hospitals, governments, health systems, health plans, life-sciences companies, retail clinics, retail pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, employer wellness clinics, and post-acute organizations, such as home health and hospice agencies. We help our clients improve the quality and efficiency of health care by providing electronic health records (&#8220;EHRs&#8221;), connectivity, hosting, outsourcing, analytics, patient engagement, clinical decision support, and population health management solutions. We are also working to further deliver integrated, evidence-based, personalized treatment plans directly to the point of care and to identify optimal ways to maximize increasing volumes of associated genomic information in the care process.

Our solutions empower healthcare professionals with the data, insights, and connectivity to other caregivers needed to succeed in an industry that is rapidly changing from fee-for-service models to fee-for-value advanced payment models. We believe we offer some of the most comprehensive solutions in our industry today. Healthcare organizations can effectively manage patients and patient populations across all care settings using a combination of our physician, hospital, health system, post-acute care, and population health management products and services. We believe these solutions will help transform health care as the industry seeks new ways to manage risk, improve quality, and reduce costs.

Healthcare IT Industry 

The healthcare IT industry is facing significant opportunities and challenges due to ongoing regulations and changes in industry standards. These include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Provider Reimbursement : In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider payment models by the United States federal government, followed by commercial payers and state governments. There is increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and increase quality, replacing fee-for-service models in part by expanding advanced payment models, which could further encourage adoption of healthcare IT. The passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (&#8220;MACRA&#8221;) in 2015 codified the creation of new payment models that will significantly expand the number of ambulatory healthcare professionals delivering care under payment programs that are driven by quality measures currently under development. Based on the intensive regulatory work under way to implement MACRA, as well as other programs already in place, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) announced its intention to ensure that fifty percent (50%) of Medicare provider payments are sourced through alternative payment models by 2018, including likely expansion of programs such as Accountable Care Organizations (&#8220;ACOs&#8221;), which reward providers who contain costs and improve quality through care coordination and population health efforts. Another initiative that involves many of our clients is the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, which is working 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

toward similar goals by emphasizing the role of the primary care provider. Another important driver of healthcare IT adoption in the primary care space is the Patient Centered Medical Home program, a voluntary program in which many of our clients are participating and that has a strong emphasis on quality measurement and patient engagement. As a result of these programs, significant levels of reimbursements will require providers to ca pture, communicate, measure, and share outcomes through technology solutions such as ours. &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

ARRA/HITECH: In 2009, the United States federal government enacted the American Recovery &#38; Reinvestment Act (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;). HITECH authorized the EHR Incentive program (the &#8220;Meaningful Use&#8221; program). This law provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The Meaningful Use program is currently in a state of evolution, as it will be incorporated into and possibly changed by the MACRA regulations for ambulatory providers delivering care to Medicare patients; it will continue as already released in the regulations associated with Stage 3 and the 2017 certification edition for Medicaid ambulatory practices and for eligible hospitals.

&#160;

&#9679; 

ANSI-5010/ICD-10: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) implemented a new version of the standards for HIPAA-covered electronic transactions, including claims, remittance advices, and requests and responses for eligibility, which are called ANSI-5010. Additionally, HIPAA required entities to upgrade to the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems from the World Health Organization, also known as ICD-10, for use in reporting medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures by no later than October 1, 2015. These changes in coding standards required our clients to upgrade to more advanced versions of our solutions. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

PPACA: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the &#8220;PPACA&#8221;), which was signed into law in 2010, has impacted and will likely continue to impact us and our clients. Some PPACA provisions may have a positive effect by requiring the expanded use of products such as ours to participate in certain federal programs. Other provisions, such as those mandating reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers, may have a negative effect by reducing the resources available to our current and prospective clients to purchase our products. Ambiguity remains for the industry as a whole regarding the future of many programs initially authorized by the PPACA, as CMS and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation continue to pilot several new approaches to payment and delivery system reform.

We believe that these and other changes in laws and regulations, along with increasing pressure from private payers to move providers to quality-based payment programs and market opportunities to maximize the data that is increasingly being created and captured through the care process, will continue to drive adoption of healthcare IT products and services such as ours. For example, although many large physician groups have already purchased EHR technology, we expect those groups may choose to replace their older EHR technology to comply with future Meaningful Use program requirements and to add new features and functionality. We also seek replacement markets for health information exchanges (&#8220;HIE&#8221;) and patient portals, despite their recent deployment.

It addresses all major aspects of patient flow in a hospital, from bed management to transport and turnover. It can help improve care coordination and communication and help maximize use of resources. 

&#160;

&#160;

Population Health Management Solutions 

Population Health Management is a strategic imperative for many healthcare executives today as they seek to address care management, patient engagement, and analytics challenges. As healthcare providers and payers migrate from volume-based to value-based care delivery, they will need interoperable population health management solutions that are connected to the consumer marketplace. To maintain relevancy to provider organizations who are growing through acquisition, these solutions must be EHR-agnostic.

In 2015, Allscripts branded its population health management portfolio &#8220;CareInMotion.&#8221; CareInMotion offers healthcare providers comprehensive solutions to the population health challenges they most often face, which may include care transitions, care team management, and patient engagement.

We design our population health management solutions for hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, physician practices, clinically integrated networks, ACOs, and organizations undertaking value-based care. Our solutions enable such organizations to connect, transition, analyze, and coordinate care across the entire care community. Our primary population health management offerings are: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts dbMotion &#8482; Solution is a strategic community connectivity platform for care coordination, population health management, and analytics that integrates discrete patient data from diverse care settings, regardless of IT supplier, into a single patient record. Through dbMotion&#8482; Collaborate, dbMotion&#8482; EHR Agent, dbMotion&#8482; Clinical Analytics Gateway and other applications, the Allscripts dbMotion&#8482; Solution provides a longitudinal clinical data repository with semantically harmonized patient data, point-of-care workflow tools, a physician portal, population health support, and an analytics gateway, all of which help reduce the cost of care delivery and enable better caregiver-to-caregiver coordination. We obtained this platform through our acquisition of dbMotion, Ltd. (&#8220;dbMotion&#8221;) in 2013. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Fusion&#8482; , introduced in 2015, identifies clinical information residing outside the providers&#8217; Allscripts EHRs (Sunrise, TouchWorks, and Professional) and delivers it directly into the point-of-care workflow. This data was historically not available because it resides in disparate clinical systems and facilities throughout the broader community. Drawing from the dbMotion interoperability platform, Fusion automatically brings delta information from other systems and incorporates it into the patient record, with no action required on the provider&#8217;s part. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Analytics PHA is a real-time, point-of-care population health analytics solution used for early identification of chronic disease and population health management. The cloud-based or on-premise solution provides analytic insight for high-cost, high-priority chronic diseases, including diabetes, asthma, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, COPD, and hypertension. The Allscripts Analytics PHA platform uses our cloud-based rules engine to display an aggregated view of clinical data from multiple sources and claims data from multiple payers. Driving analytics to the point of care helps providers facilitate early intervention, address gaps in care, prevent disease progression, and reduce readmissions in today&#8217;s demanding, value-based healthcare environment.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts FollowMyHealth &#174; is a cloud-based patient engagement platform that is EHR-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with systems across the healthcare system. Patients have a single point of access regardless of the individual provider&#8217;s software, and discrete patient-generated data flows directly back to the EHR to automatically populate the medical record. FollowMyHealth can be &#8220;white labeled&#8221; to expand the organization&#8217;s brand footprint across an entire community, and its software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;)-delivery model ensures rapid deployment and places minimal demands on internal IT resources. Through FollowMyHealth &#174; Achieve and FollowMyHealth &#174; Telemedicine, providers can engage patients directly in their care and support remote diagnosis and treatment. We obtained FollowMyHealth through our acquisition of Jardogs LLC (&#8220;Jardogs&#8221;) in 2013. Allscripts supports users with Patient Engagement Consulting Services (support to help patients register for and begin using FollowMyHealth regularly) and Level 1 Support Services (ongoing assistance for patients who might need help navigating the patient portal).

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Care Management &#8482; is a fully-integrated, web-based solution that consolidates utilization management, discharge planning, documentation integrity, quality management, and risk management for hospitals and post-acute care facilities. This system is based on a SaaS-model designed to provide ease of use and minimal IT staff involvement. Using Allscripts Care Director &#8482; , providers can manage outpatient care across home care, physician practices, hospitals, post-acute care facilities, and community services, improving transitions of care, reducing potential readmissions, decreasing redundancies, and connecting all care settings. Patient information can be imported directly into Allscripts Care Director, or pulled from Sunrise Acute Care or certain other third-party EHR systems via Allscripts Care Management.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Referral Management &#8482; enables home health agencies, hospice agencies, and post-acute care facilities to track all patient referrals in a single system. Using this solution, organizations automatically receive and respond to referrals from hospitals, enter referrals from non-electronic sources, and collect marketing information. The Allscripts Referral Management platform currently reaches approximately 90,000 providers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscr ipts EPSi &#8482; delivers integrated financial and clinical data and operational intelligence for actionable insights that can help providers decrease costs, maximize revenues, and improve quality of care. In addition, EPSi&#8217;s flexible analytics data model offers complete capabilities for financial planning, budgeting, and cost accounting . &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Homecare &#8482; improves clinical quality of care, financial performance, and operational control for large, integrated home care organizations and small home care companies. With a strong mobile platform as well as business, clinical, and scheduling functionalities, it enables users across home health, hospice, and private duty organizations to support EHR capabilities specifically to these segments. 

During 2015, we further advanced our population health management capabilities by introducing additional innovative features, functionality, and enhancements to our solutions, particularly in the areas of connectivity, collaboration, and data analytics. For example, dbMotion&#8217;s platform is capable of harmonizing data from more than 370 clinical information systems such as EHR, radiology, and laboratory systems. As of the end of 2015, it was being used in approximately 640 hospitals and care settings globally. Also as of the end of 2015, more than 3,450 healthcare organizations were using FollowMyHealth, connecting more than 396,000 providers and caregivers, and more than 5.5 million registered users, which represents significant growth from the prior year end. These solutions contribute to our current success, and we expect them to remain one of the key drivers of our future growth, both domestically and globally.

Services 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Managed IT Services are modular, long-term outsourcing services that enhance productivity for healthcare professionals. Our services model uses skilled professionals, best practices, and proven technology to enable continuous improvement across the healthcare organization. These services assist clients who need experienced staff to augment IT projects or implementations. Alternatively, our clients can fully outsource their entire IT function to us, in which case we manage the day-to-day operations of their IT function, including related procurement and budgeting activities. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Allscripts Hosting Solutions help our clients manage their complex healthcare IT solutions infrastructure, which frees up physical space, resources, and costs associated with maintaining computer servers and deploying client-based applications on-site. We effectively manage our clients&#8217; hosted environment, including providing backup, recovery management, maintenance, and security services.

This solution provides the opportunity for physician practices to achieve optimization of best-practice business processes for improved financial results.

Payer and Life Sciences

A successful value-based care environment requires more efficient communication and collaboration among all stakeholders in the healthcare continuum. To effect holistic change in health care, we collaborate with payers, providers, life-sciences companies, pharmacy benefit managers, and other partners to develop new programs, processes and content to enhance clinical solutions and improve outcomes for patients. Programs include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Patient assistance and adherence programs provide financial assistance, patient education, and compliance reminders to improve outcomes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Electronic prior authorization and medical record abstract solutions decrease costs and staff burden for both providers and payers by providing the automated workflows that can help improve efficiency. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gaps-in-care programs provide evidence-based decision support to providers within their workflows, with no additional effort or cost to them due to the support of our life sciences partners. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Data offerings from our breadth of providers enable payers and life-sciences organizations access to a real-world resource for research, insight, and analysis. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Consumer payment capabilities, embedded in our FollowMyHealth patient engagement platform, make payment easier for patients and reduce the risk of revenue loss for providers. &#160;

Benefits of Using Our Products and Services 

We believe that our large base of clients, providers and patients as well as our solutions differentiate us from our competition. We also believe we can help lead the shift from fee-for-service care to value-based care, both domestically and globally. We offer a single platform of clinical, financial, connectivity, consumer, and information solutions, as well as stand-alone solutions in nearly every significant health information management category. Moreover, we are one of the few healthcare IT companies that can deliver high-quality solutions for every major healthcare setting, from solo physician practices to large academic medical groups, hospitals of every size and configuration, and post-acute organizations, such as skilled nursing facilities, home care, and hospice. A number of our solutions are cloud-based or web-based, which enables our clients to access our solutions via an Internet browser or, in some cases, via mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house. 

We champion and innovate Open healthcare IT solutions, which means most of our products can operate with existing installed systems. Our Open platform gives clients the freedom to work with multiple vendor systems at a lower cost. Our platform enables clients and third parties to natively build applications without requiring interfaces, which are a costly and common part of solutions that use closed and proprietary architectures. 

Our Strategy 

Given the breadth of our portfolio and global client installed base, we believe we are well positioned to connect physicians and caregivers to patients and payers to the caregivers across all healthcare settings. We continue to compete for new opportunities among physician offices, multi-group physician specialty practices, community hospitals and health systems that are looking to one IT supplier to provide an end-to-end solution across all points of care. We believe our leadership position in the ambulatory space, in particular, gives us a competitive advantage in this regard as hospitals and health systems increasingly seek referring relationships with independent physicians across the communities they serve.

To reduce costs while maintaining the highest quality of care, healthcare organizations globally need to address certain strategic imperatives. Our solutions address needs critical to the future of health care, including community connectivity, interoperability, data analytics, and consumer engagement.

&#160;

&#183; 

Community Connectivity &#8211; Our care coordination solutions improve safety and quality as a patient transitions from one care setting to another. We help build assessments, monitor results, track outcomes, and make modifications in a person&#8217;s care plan. Health care is a group effort, and having full visibility into a patient&#8217;s care plan is critical. Access to comprehensive patient information is key, and our community solutions help create an organized, longitudinal patient record spanning all points of care. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Interoperability &#8211; We employ a wide array of interoperability tools to support our clients&#8217; desire to connect to numerous stakeholders in the industry, including other healthcare providers, labs, imaging facilities, public health entities and patients, as well as other third-party technology providers. Options available to our clients include our dbMotion and FollowMyHealth solutions, direct messaging, product interfaces, connectivity to Health Information Systems Programs (&#8220;HISP&#8221;) and connectivity to public or private health information exchange organizations. Further, our unique Open platform is a proven, scalable and user-friendly technology that connects both clinical and financial data across every setting. Many third-party and client developers have successfully integrated their technology with our Open platform using our proprietary Unity application programming interfaces (&#8220;API&#8221;), and applications and devices connected with this platform have exchanged data or taken some action in the Allscripts product over one billion times since 2013. We have also begun work to offer APIs based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (&#8220;FHIR&#8221;). With this unique Open platform, clients can connect to any certified application or device, which saves time and money and gives clients full access to a variety of innovative solutions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Data Analytics &#8211; Healthcare organizations need to analyze dependencies, trends, and patterns. Data-driven decisions require real-time, clean data for better decisions at the point of care. Insights and analytics serve as the foundation for informed analysis and effective planning. They need information that produces true business and clinical intelligence to better manage patient populations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Consumer Engagement &#8211; Our patient engagement software helps healthcare organizations achieve better outcomes, reduce emergency room visits, and decrease hospitalizations. Our software also integrates with solutions across an organization, regardless of a provider&#8217;s software. With a patient engagement platform, individuals and their families have the opportunity to become active members of their care team, which improves results. 

&#160;

&#160;

These key strategic areas all help healthcare providers better manage populations of patients, especially those with costly chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, to help bring down the cost of care and improve patient outcomes. 

Finally, with a national focus on value-based care and recent advances in molecular science and computer technology, we are seeing opportunities for the delivery of precision medicine solutions, an emerging model that brings insights from an individual patient&#8217;s genome to care decisions and delivery. We believe these solutions will transform the coordination and delivery of health care, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Accordingly, in 2015 we formed a Precision Medicine business unit and entered into a strategic partnership with Nant Health, LLC (&#8220;NantHealth&#8221;), a cloud-based IT company providing comprehensive genomic and protein-based molecular diagnostics testing. Our Precision Medicine business unit intends to focus on aiding clinicians in making informed decisions by integrating complex data sets and delivering actionable insights at the point of care.

Business Organization

We primarily derive our revenues from sales of our proprietary software (either as a perpetual license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which also serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation services, and managed services solutions such as outsourcing, remote hosting, and revenue cycle management. 

We revised our reportable segments effective January 1, 2015. Prior to this change, we used three reportable segments: Clinical and Financial Solutions, Population Health, and Managed Services. We revised our reportable segments in order to better align our reporting structure with our management of resource allocation and performance assessment. These changes also completed our transition, which we initiated in 2013, from a functional organization to a strategic business unit model solely aligned with our key software products.

Under our new reporting structure, the revenue and related costs associated with providing outsourcing and remote hosting managed services are allocated to our other strategic business units based on the underlying software products to which these services relate. Outsourcing and remote hosting managed services were previously each deemed to be individual strategic business units and were aggregated into our former Managed Services reportable segment. After the finalization of the changes to our reporting structure, we identified five operating segments, which were aggregated into two reportable segments: (i) Clinical and Financial Solutions and (ii) Population Health.

Information regarding financial data by segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and in Note 13, &#8220;Business Segments,&#8221; in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Clients 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 180,000 physicians, 2,500 hospitals, and 17,000 post-acute facilities use our products and services. Our clients, including some of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals in the United States, often serve as a reference source for prospective clients who are interested in purchasing our solutions. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Research and Development 

Rapid innovation characterizes the healthcare IT industry. We believe our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the markets in which we operate. 

Because of this, we continue to invest heavily into our research and development efforts. These efforts are primarily focused on developing new solutions as well as new features and enhancements to our existing solutions, which we believe will ensure that our solutions comply with continually evolving regulatory requirements and create additional opportunities to connect our systems to the healthcare community.

&#160;

&#160;

Our total gross research and development spending was approximately $234.1 million, $233.5 million, and $241.8 million for the years ended December 3 1, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts consist of research and development expenses of $184.8 million, $192.8 million, and $199.8 million, and capitalized software development costs of $49.3 million, $40.7 million, and $42.0 million, for each of these periods respectively. We expense research and development expenses as incurred, and we capitalize software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility of the software is established, or when the preliminary project phase is completed in the case of internal use software, until the software is available for general release. Non-capitalizable research and development costs and other software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

Competition

The markets for our solutions and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and solution standards, as well as frequent introduction of new solutions and services. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. 

Additionally, many of our prospective clients have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate competing solutions to ours. As a consequence, they may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our solutions. Third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. 

We compete primarily with numerous types of organizations, including developers of revenue cycle and practice management solutions, large system integrators, electronic prescribing solutions, ambulatory and acute care EHR solutions, emergency department information systems, population health management technology, analytics systems, care management solutions, post-acute discharge management solutions, and homecare EHR solutions.

Backlog 

We had a contract backlog of $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of approximately $200 million or 6%. Contract backlog represents the value of bookings and support and maintenance contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Total contract backlog increased primarily due to an increase in bookings related to subscription-based agreements and managed services, such as outsourcing, remote hosting and revenue cycle management. We estimate that approximately 35% of our aggregate contract backlog as of December 31, 2015 will be recognized as revenue during 2016. 

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, and other third parties and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. 

Many of our products include intellectual property obtained from third parties. For example: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Many of our products are built on technology provided by Microsoft Corporation, such as the Microsoft SQL Server information platform, the Microsoft .NET Framework, and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We license content from companies such as OptumInsight, 3M Health Information Systems and Wolters Kluwer Health, which we incorporate or use in certain solutions. 

&#160;

&#160;

It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services. While we have generally been able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that we can obtain such licenses in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of continu ous healthcare IT innovation, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our solutions may unknowingly infringe upon an existing patent or other intellectual property rights o f others. Occasionally, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution any of these i nfringement notices will have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Geographic Information

Historically, the majority of our clients and revenue have been associated with North America, where we have clients in the United States and Canada. While we remain focused on the North American market, which we expect will continue to drive our revenue in the future, we believe that there are opportunities for us globally as other countries face similar challenges of controlling healthcare costs while improving the quality and efficiency of health care delivery. As a result, we have increased our efforts to selectively expand the sales of many of our solutions outside of North America, primarily in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, our domestic and international sales accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Note 15, &#8220;Geographic Information,&#8221; in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 6,900 employees worldwide. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
