Our Company

808 Renewable Energy Corporation (the "Company", "we", "our") was formed as a Nevada corporation in May 2009 for the purpose of acquiring, developing, owning and managing renewable and efficient energy projects throughout the United States. Before forming 808 Renewable Energy Corporation, we operated 808 Energy 3, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in January 2009 for the purpose of acquiring, re-commissioning and operating distributed generation ("DG") energy facilities, also known as combined heat and power ("CHP") plants. On August 20, 2010, 808 Renewable acquired all of the then-outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 3, LLC not then already owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 3, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of 808 Renewable. We also acquired 808 Energy 2, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in August 2008 to acquire the CHP plant located at Pacific Clay Products, Inc. in Lake Elsinore, California. Effective as of June 30, 2011, 808 Renewable acquired all of the then-outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 2, LLC not then already owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 2, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of 808 Renewable.

&#160;

Being wholly-owned subsidiaries of 808 Renewable immediately before such event, both 808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC were dissolved as of April 23, 2012, at which time all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of 808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC vested in 808 Renewable, and all debts, liabilities and duties of 808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC became the debts, liabilities and duties of 808 Renewable.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 2082 Michelson Drive, Ste. 301, Irvine California, 92612. Our telephone number is (714) 891 8282, and our website address is www.808RenewableEnergy.com.

808 Renewable Energy, or the Company, distributes, owns and operates clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat and cooling. Our business model includes ownership of the equipment that we install at customers' facilities and the sale of the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a long-term contractual basis. We also provide engineering and other professional services to clients who own their own on-site energy systems, but require assistance in their operation and maintenance.

&#160;

We offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and energy efficient. Our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator, while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for use at the site. We also distribute and operate water chiller systems for building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner, except that the engine's power drives a large air-conditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water. Cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water for the site to use as required. By simultaneously providing electricity, hot water and heat, cogeneration systems also have a significant, positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon or CO 2 produced by offsetting the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and conventional hot water boilers.

&#160;

Our customers pay us for energy produced on site at a rate that is a certain percentage below the rate at which the utility companies provide them electrical and natural gas services. We measure the actual amount of electrical and thermal energy produced and charge our customers accordingly. We agree to install, operate, maintain and repair our energy systems at our sole cost and expense. We also agree to obtain any necessary permits or regulatory approvals at our sole expense. Our agreements are generally for a term of up to 15 years, with renewable provisions upon the mutual agreement of the parties

&#160;

For the customers that want to own their CHP system, we offer our "turn-key" option whereby we provide equipment, systems engineering, installation, interconnect approvals, on-site labor and startup services needed to bring the complete CHP system on-line. For some customers, we are also paid a fee to operate the systems and charge for those systems on a negotiated basis.

&#160;

During 2014, the Company had seven revenue producing operational energy systems, one of which was operational, only, for the month of January 2014, but due to a change of ownership at that location, ceased to be revenue producing at January 31, 2014. During 2015 the Company had four revenue producing operational energy systems, one of which became operational in June 2015.
