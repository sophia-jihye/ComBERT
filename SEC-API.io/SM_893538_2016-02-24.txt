 ITEMS 1. and 2. BUSINESS and PROPERTIES 

General 

We are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (also respectively referred to as &#8220;oil,&#8221; &#8220;gas,&#8221; and &#8220;NGLs&#8221; throughout the document) in onshore North America. We were founded in 1908 and incorporated in Delaware in 1915. Our initial public offering of common stock was in December 1992. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;SM.&#8221; 

Our principal offices are located at 1775 Sherman Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80203, and our telephone number is (303) 861-8140. 

Strategy 

Our strategic objective is to profitably build our ownership and operatorship of North American oil, gas, and NGL producing assets that have high operating margins and significant opportunities for additional economic investment. We pursue growth opportunities through both exploration and acquisitions, and seek to maximize the value of our assets through industry-leading technology application and outstanding operational execution. We focus on achieving high full-cycle economic returns on our investments and maintaining a simple, strong balance sheet through a conservative approach to leverage. 

Significant Developments in 2015 &#32; 

&#8226; 

Production. &#32;&#32;We achieved record levels of production for 2015 . Our average daily production was composed of 52.7 &#32;MBbl of oil, 475.7 &#32;MMcf of gas, and 44.0 &#32;MBbl of NGLs, for an average equivalent production rate of 175.9 MBOE per day, which was an increase &#32;of 16 percent &#32;from an average of 151.1 &#32;MBOE per day in 2014 . Please refer to Core Operational Areas &#32;below for additional discussion. 

&#8226; 

Reserves and Capital Investment. Our estimated proved reserves decreased &#32; 14 percent &#32;to 471.3 &#32;MMBOE at December 31, 2015 , from 547.7 &#32;MMBOE at December 31, 2014 , of which 25.4 &#32;MMBOE related to the divestiture of proved reserves. We added 160.6 &#32;MMBOE through drilling activities during the year, led by our activities in the Eagle Ford shale and Bakken/Three Forks resource plays. Costs incurred for drilling and exploration activities, excluding acquisitions, decreased &#32; 34 percent &#32;to $1.4 billion &#32;in 2015 &#32;when compared to 2014 . We had strong reserve additions as a result of our success in reducing costs, optimizing completions, and generating better well results in our core development programs; however, these additions were offset by the impact of lower commodity prices. Our proved reserve life decreased &#32;to 7.3 &#32;years in 2015 &#32;compared to 9.9 &#32;years in 2014 . Please refer to Reserves and Core Operational Areas &#32;below for additional discussion. 

&#8226; 

Increased Liquidity . During 2015, we extended the maturity of a portion of our long-term debt by using the proceeds from our issuance of $500.0 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% &#32;Senior Notes due 2025 &#32;to redeem the $350.0 million principal amount of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2019. The earliest maturity for any of our Senior Notes occurs in 2021. Please refer to Overview of Liquidity 

and Capital Resources &#32;in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional discussion on our current and future liquidity. 

&#8226; 

Divestiture Activity . During 2015 , we divested a total of 25.4 &#32;MMBOE of proved reserves in multiple transactions for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $357.9 million . Our most significant divestiture activity was the sale of our Mid-Continent assets in the second quarter of 2015. 

&#8226; 

Sustained Low Commodity Prices . Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by the prices we receive for oil, gas, and NGLs, which can fluctuate dramatically. 

Oil prices continued to decline throughout 2015. The daily NYMEX spot price ranged from a high of $61.43 &#32;per Bbl in June &#32;to a low of $34.73 &#32;per Bbl in December . Oil prices declined further subsequent to year end 2015, dropping to a 12-year low of $26.21 &#32;per Bbl in February &#32; 2016 . The average NYMEX price decreased to $48.68 &#32;per Bbl in 2015 &#32;compared to $93.03 &#32;per Bbl in 2014 . 

Natural gas prices have been under downward pressure over the past several years due to high levels of supply and remained highly volatile during 2015 . The daily NYMEX spot price ranged from a high of $3.29 &#32;per MMBtu in January &#32;to a low of $1.53 &#32;per MMBtu in December . The average NYMEX price decreased in 2015 &#32;to $2.61 &#32;per MMBtu compared to $4.35 &#32;per MMBtu in 2014 . 

NGL prices continued to decrease in 2015 &#32;in line with oil price declines. The monthly OPIS NGL price ranged from a high of $22.57 &#32;per Bbl in February &#32;to a low of $17.07 &#32;per Bbl in December . NGL prices declined further subsequent to year end 2015 , dropping to a low of $14.73 &#32;per Bbl in January &#32; 2016 . The average OPIS price decreased in 2015 &#32;to $19.76 &#32;per Bbl compared to $38.93 &#32;per Bbl in 2014 . 

&#8226; 

Impairments. We recorded impairment of proved properties expense of $468.7 million , abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense of $78.6 million , and impairment of other property and equipment expense of $49.4 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . These impairments were largely due to commodity price declines, which impacted our Powder River Basin program and certain legacy and non-core assets, as well as our decision to reduce capital invested in the development of our east Texas exploration program in light of the sustained, low commodity price environment. 

Outlook for 2016 &#32; 

Our goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve liquidity in the current commodity price environment. We expect to incur capital expenditures below adjusted EBITDAX in order to minimize any impact to our total debt. We believe this focus on our liquidity will best preserve our balance sheet and will give us the flexibility to adapt as industry conditions change. 

Our capital program for 2016 will be approximately $705 million, of which, approximately 85 percent will be invested in drilling and completion activities, with the focus on our core development programs in the Bakken/Three Forks, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford shale. We plan to continue our focus on conducting safe operations even as we pursue cost saving measures throughout our business. Please refer to Outlook for 2016 &#32;under Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional discussion concerning our capital plans for 2016 . 

Core Operational Areas 

Our 2015 operations were concentrated in four onshore operating areas in the United States. We divested our Mid-Continent assets during the second quarter of 2015.

(4) 

Amounts do not sum to total costs incurred due to certain costs relating to our new venture projects being excluded from the regional table above. 

In general, we reduced our capital spending activity across all regions during 2015 in light of the low commodity price environment. We had strong proved reserve additions and positive performance revisions for the year ended December 31, 2015, especially in our Eagle Ford shale and Bakken/Three Forks resource plays; however, our total estimated proved reserves decreased from year-end 2014 due to the divestiture of our Mid-Continent assets, a significant negative price revision, and the removal of proved undeveloped reserves related to changes in our development plan. 

South Texas &#38; Gulf Coast Region. Operations in our South Texas &#38; Gulf Coast region are managed from our office in Houston, Texas. Within this region, we have both operated and non-operated Eagle Ford shale programs on approximately 197,000 net acres. Our operated program accounts for approximately 80 percent of our total Eagle Ford acreage and production. Our acreage position covers a significant portion of the western Eagle Ford shale play, including acreage in the oil/condensate, NGL-rich gas, and dry gas windows of the play. Our development program has shifted to utilizing longer laterals and completions with higher sand loadings, which is 

resulting in improved well performance as shown in our positive performance revision to our proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

A significant portion of our 2015 capital was deployed in our South Texas &#38; Gulf Coast region in our operated and outside-operated Eagle Ford shale programs. We incurred $765.3 million &#32;of costs to add approximately 119.3 &#32;MMBOE of estimated proved reserves through our drilling activities. As of December 31, 2015, we had 76 &#32;gross and net wells that had been drilled but not completed in our operated Eagle Ford shale program. Production for 2015 &#32;increased 21 percent &#32;over 2014 &#32;to 48.5 &#32;MMBOE. Estimated proved reserves decreased 13 percent &#32;at year-end 2015 &#32;to 342.4 &#32;MMBOE from 394.6 &#32;MMBOE at year-end 2014 . 

Rocky Mountain Region. Operations in our Rocky Mountain region are managed from our office in Billings, Montana. We have approximately 162,000 net acres being actively developed in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. During 2015, we focused on testing completion optimizations and down-spacing in Divide County, North Dakota. 

In the Powder River Basin, we have approximately 204,000 net acres, a large portion of which are prospective for the Frontier and Shannon intervals. Given the current commodity price environment, we have reduced our activity in the Powder River Basin. 

We incurred $538.5 million &#32;of costs to add approximately 34.6 &#32;MMBOE of estimated proved reserves in our Rocky Mountain region through our drilling activities. As of December 31, 2015, we had 48 &#32;gross ( 40 &#32;net) drilled but not completed wells in our operated Bakken/Three Forks program. Production for 2015 &#32;increased 30 percent &#32;over 2014 &#32;to 11.3 &#32;MMBOE. Estimated proved reserves slightly decreased to 108.1 &#32;MMBOE at year-end 2015 from 108.4 &#32;MMBOE at year-end 2014 . 

Permian Region. Operations in our Permian region are managed from our office in Midland, Texas. Our Permian region covers western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 23,000 net acres in our Permian region, a large portion of which is held by production. We began 2015 with one operated drilling rig and dropped this rig during the second quarter of 2015. 

Costs incurred in our Permian region decreased to $59.4 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;compared to $195.4 million &#32;in 2014 . Estimated proved reserves increased four percent &#32;to 20.8 &#32;MMBOE at year-end 2015 from 20.0 &#32;MMBOE at year-end 2014 . Production decreased three percent &#32;to 2.7 &#32;MMBOE in 2015 from 2.8 &#32;MMBOE in 2014 . 

Mid-Continent Region. During the second quarter of 2015, we divested our Mid-Continent assets located in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and Arklatex area of east Texas and northern Louisiana. We also closed our regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma in mid-2015. 

Reserves 

The table below presents summary information with respect to the estimates of our proved reserves for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 . We engaged Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (&#8220;Ryder Scott&#8221;) to audit at least 80 percent of our total calculated proved reserve PV-10 for each year presented. The prices used in the calculation of proved reserve estimates reflect the 12-month average of the first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) rules, and were $50.28 &#32;per Bbl for oil, $2.59 &#32;per MMBtu for natural gas, and $20.20 &#32;per Bbl for NGLs for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We then adjust these prices to reflect appropriate quality and location differentials over the period in estimating our proved reserves. 

Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates for new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than reserve estimates for producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as new information becomes available. PV-10 shown in the following table is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. The actual quantities and present value of our estimated proved reserves may be more or less than we have estimated. No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since the beginning of the last fiscal year. The following table should be read along with the section entitled Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Business below. 

Our ability to replace our production is critical to us. Please refer to the reserve replacement term in the Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms &#32;section of this report for information describing how this metric is calculated. 

The following table summarizes estimated proved reserves, PV-10, and standardized measure of discounted future cash flows as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 :

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period. As of December 31, 2015 , 2.8 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves have been on our books in excess of five years. These reserves are associated with three wells that were drilled in 2015 and are scheduled to be completed and producing in 2016. 

For locations that are more than one location removed from developed producing locations, we utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology to add approximately 76.4 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves in the more developed portions of our Eagle Ford shale position, 5.1 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves in the more developed portions of our Bakken/Three Forks shale position, and 0.4 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves in the more developed portion of our Wolfcamp shale position in the Permian Basin. We incorporated public and proprietary data from multiple sources to establish geologic continuity of each formation and their producing properties. This included seismic data and interpretations (3-D and micro seismic), open hole log information (both vertically and horizontally collected), and petrophysical analysis of the log data, mud logs, gas sample analysis, measurements of total organic content, thermal maturity, test production, fluid properties, and core data as well as significant statistical performance data yielding predictable and repeatable reserve estimates within certain analogous areas. These locations were limited to only those areas where both established geologic consistency and sufficient statistical performance data could be demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results. In all other areas, we restricted proved undeveloped locations to immediate offsets to producing wells. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 226.8 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves, which is a decrease &#32;of 34.1 &#32;MMBOE, or 13 percent , from 260.9 &#32;MMBOE at December 31, 2014 . The following table provides a reconciliation of our proved undeveloped reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015 :

____________________________________________ 

(1) 

Revisions of previous estimates primarily relate to a negative price revision of 57.0 MMBOE due to the decline in commodity prices during 2015. The negative price revision was partially offset by positive performance revisions totaling 21.6 &#32;MMBOE primarily in our Eagle Ford shale and Bakken/Three Forks resource plays due to improved performance related to enhanced completions and reductions in operating expenses, which extended the economic lives of the wells. 

(2) 

We added 98.6 &#32;MMBOE of infill proved undeveloped reserves primarily in our Eagle Ford shale and Bakken/Three Forks resource plays, as well as an additional 21.0 &#32;MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves through extensions and discoveries, primarily in our Eagle Ford shale play. 

(3) 

Proved undeveloped reserves were reduced by 79.4 &#32;MMBOE due to changes in our development plan, which caused these locations to be reclassified primarily to the probable reserves category due to the five-year rule. These locations were replaced by higher quality proved undeveloped reserves, which are classified as extensions or infills in the table above, and resulted from our testing and delineation programs implemented during 2015. 

(4) 

Conversions of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves were primarily in our Eagle Ford shale and Bakken/Three Forks resource plays. During 2015 , we incurred approximately $415 million &#32;on projects associated with reserves booked as proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2014 . Our 2015 track record and development pace were both below 20 percent. This was due to delineation and testing of an incremental landing zone in our Eagle Ford shale asset, delineation and testing of the Bakken interval, step-out drilling on acreage acquired late in 2014 in our Divide County, North Dakota position, and due to the large reserve volumes associated with drilled and uncompleted wells at year-end 2015. At December 31, 2015, drilled but uncompleted wells represent 59.2 MMBOE of total proved undeveloped reserves. Our multi-year historical track is in excess of 20 percent. 

As of December 31, 2015 , estimated future development costs relating to our proved undeveloped reserves are approximately $478 million , $344 million , and $465 million &#32;in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , respectively. 

Internal Controls Over Proved Reserves Estimates 

Our internal controls over the recording of proved reserves are structured to objectively and accurately estimate our reserve quantities and values in compliance with the SEC&#8217;s regulations. Our process for managing and monitoring our proved reserves is delegated to our corporate reserves group, which is managed by our Engineering Manager - Corporate Reserves, subject to the oversight of our management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, as discussed below. Our Engineering Manager - Corporate Reserves has over 15 years of experience in the energy industry, and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering with a Petroleum Certificate from the University of Alabama. She is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Technical, geological, and engineering reviews of our assets are performed throughout the year by our regional staff. This data, in conjunction with economic data and our ownership information, is used in making a determination of estimated proved reserve quantities. Our regional engineering technical staff do not report directly to our Engineering Manager - Corporate Reserves; they report to either their respective regional technical managers 

or directly to the regional manager. This design is intended to promote objective and independent analysis within our regions in the proved reserves estimation process. 

Third-party Reserves Audit 

Ryder Scott performed an independent audit using its own engineering assumptions, but with economic and ownership data we provided. Ryder Scott audits a minimum of 80 percent of our total calculated proved reserve PV-10. In the aggregate, the proved reserve amounts of our audited properties determined by Ryder Scott are required to be within 10 percent of our proved reserve amounts for the total company, as well as for each respective region. Ryder Scott is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum engineering consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. The technical person at Ryder Scott primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves audit is an Advising Senior Vice President who received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University in 1979 and a Master of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981. He is a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The Ryder Scott 2015 &#32;report concerning our reserves is included as Exhibit 99.1. 

In addition to a third party audit, our reserves are reviewed by our management with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Management, which includes our President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President - Operations, is responsible for reviewing and verifying that the estimate of proved reserves is reasonable, complete, and accurate. The Audit Committee reviews a summary of the final reserves estimate in conjunction with Ryder Scott&#8217;s results and also meets with Ryder Scott representatives from time to time to discuss processes and findings.

Amounts may not calculate due to rounding. 

Productive Wells 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had working interests in 1,459 gross (872 net) productive oil wells and 1,772 gross (653 net) productive gas wells. Productive wells are either wells producing in commercial quantities or wells mechanically capable of commercial production, but are temporarily shut-in. Multiple completions in the same wellbore are counted as one well. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based on the ratio of gas to oil when it first commenced production, but such designation may not be indicative of current production. 

Drilling and Completion Activity 

All of our drilling and completion activities are conducted by independent contractors. We do not own any drilling or completion equipment. The following table summarizes the number of operated and outside-operated wells drilled and completed or recompleted on our properties in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , excluding non-consented projects, active injector wells, salt water disposal wells, and any wells in which we own only a royalty interest:

A productive well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that is producing or capable of commercial production of oil, gas, and/or NGLs. A non-productive well, frequently referred to within the industry as a dry hole, is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing oil, gas, and/or NGLs in commercial quantities to justify completion, or upon completion, the economic operation of a well. 

As defined by the SEC, an exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of equipment for production of oil, gas, and/or NGLs, or in the case of a dry well, the reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been plugged and abandoned. 

In addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2015 &#32;(included in the table above), as of January 31, 2016, we were participating in the drilling of 33 gross wells. We operate 9 of these wells on a gross basis (7.5 on a net basis) and other companies operate the remaining 24 gross wells (4 on a net basis). With respect to completion activity, at such date, there were 364 gross wells in which we have an interest that were being completed or waiting on completion. We operate 143 of these wells on a gross basis (134 on a net basis) and were participating in 221 gross (38 on a net basis) outside-operated wells. 

Acreage 

The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and gas leasehold, fee properties, and mineral servitudes that we hold as of December 31, 2015 . Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests containing proved undeveloped reserves.

____________________________________________ 

(1) 

Developed acreage is acreage assigned to producing wells for the state approved spacing unit for the producing formation. Our developed acreage that includes multiple formations with different well spacing requirements may be considered undeveloped for certain formations, but has been included only as developed acreage in the presentation above. 

(2) 

Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil, gas, and/or NGLs regardless of whether such acreage contains estimated net proved reserves. 

(3) 

As of the filing date of this report, approximately 144,100 , 85,300 , and 26,700 net acres are scheduled to expire by December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , respectively, if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the applicable lease or leases. Our east Texas acreage, which has been impaired as of December 31, 2015, represents more than 50 percent of the net acres scheduled to expire over the next three years. 

Delivery Commitments 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had gathering, processing, and transportation throughput commitments with various parties that require us to deliver fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified time frames. We have an aggregate minimum commitment to deliver 2,277 &#32;Bcf of natural gas and 36 &#32;MMBbl of oil through 2028 , of which the first 1,059 &#32;Bcf of natural gas delivered under a certain agreement does not have a deficiency payment. We are required to make periodic deficiency payments for any shortfalls in delivering the minimum volume commitments. If a shortfall in the minimum volume commitment for natural gas is projected, we have rights under certain contracts to arrange for third party gas to be delivered, and such volume will count toward our minimum volume commitment. Our current production is insufficient to offset these aggregate contractual liabilities, but we expect to fulfill the delivery commitments with production from the future development of our proved undeveloped reserves and from the future development of resources not yet characterized as proved reserves or through arranging for the delivery of third party gas. In the event that no product is delivered in accordance with these agreements, the aggregate undiscounted deficiency payments would be approximately $864.0 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Subsequent to December 31, 2015 , we entered into amendments to oil and gas gathering agreements related to certain of our Eagle Ford shale assets, neither of which previously had a minimum volume commitment, in order to obtain more favorable rates and terms. Under these amendments, we are now committed to deliver 310 &#32;Bcf of natural gas and 41 &#32;MMBbl of oil through 2034. In the event that we deliver no product, the aggregate undiscounted deficiency payments under these amended agreements would be approximately $360.8 million . Subsequent to December 31, 2015 , we also entered into an amendment to a gas gathering agreement related to certain other Eagle Ford shale assets, which reduced our volume commitment amount as of December 31, 2015 , by 829 &#32;Bcf and the aggregate undiscounted deficiency payments by $118.2 million . As a result of these subsequent amendments, the aggregate undiscounted deficiency payments as of December 31, 2015, would have been approximately $1.1 billion. 

As of the filing date of this report, we do not expect any material shortfalls. 

Major Customers 

We do not believe the loss of any single purchaser of our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs would materially impact our operating results, as these are products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers are present in our operating regions. During 2015 &#32;and 2014, we had one &#32;major customer that represented approximately 21 percent &#32;and 19 percent , respectively, of our total production revenue, which is discussed in the next paragraph. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we also sold to four &#32;entities that are under common ownership. In aggregate, these four &#32;entities represented approximately 10 percent &#32;and 14 percent &#32;of our total production revenue in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively; however, none of these entities individually represented more than 10 percent &#32;of our production revenue. Additionally, in 2015 we sold to three &#32;entities that are under common ownership, which in aggregate represented 11 percent &#32;of our total production revenue; however, none of these entities individually represented more than 10 percent &#32;of our production revenue. During 2013 , we had three &#32;major customers that represented approximately 26 percent , 16 percent , and 12 percent , respectively, of our total production revenue. 

During the third quarter of 2013, we entered into various marketing agreements with a joint venture partner, whereby we are subject to certain gathering, transportation, and processing throughput commitments for up to 10 years pursuant to each contract. While our joint venture partner is the first purchaser under these contracts, representing 21 percent &#32;and 19 percent &#32;of our total production revenue in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, we also share with it the risk of non-performance by its counterparty purchasers and have included this joint venture partner as a major customer in the discussion above. Several of the joint venture partner&#8217;s counterparty purchasers under these contracts are also direct purchasers of our production from other areas. 

Employees and Office Space 

As of February 17, 2016 , we had 786 full-time employees. This is an approximate 12 percent decrease from the 896 reported full-time employees as of February 18, 2015. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

The following table summarizes the approximate square footage of office space leased by us, as of December 31, 2015 , including our corporate headquarters and regional offices:

During the third quarter of 2015, we vacated our office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We have subleased this space through 2019 &#32;and our lease expires in 2022. 

In addition to the leased office space in the table above, we own a total of 72,000 &#32;square feet of office space. 

Title to Properties 

Substantially all of our interests are held pursuant to oil and gas leases from third parties. A title opinion is usually obtained prior to the commencement of initial drilling operations. We have obtained title opinions or have conducted other title review on substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Most of our producing properties are subject to mortgages securing indebtedness under our credit facility, royalty and overriding royalty interests, liens for current taxes, and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the value of, such properties. We typically perform only minimal title investigation before acquiring undeveloped leasehold acreage. 

Seasonality 

Generally, but not always, the demand and price levels for natural gas increase during winter months and decrease during summer months. To lessen the impact of seasonal demand fluctuations, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies, and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and forward purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. However, increased summertime demand for electricity can divert gas that traditionally is placed into storage. This could reduce the typical seasonal price differential. Demand for oil and heating oil is also generally higher in the winter and the summer driving season, although oil prices are impacted more significantly by global supply and demand. Seasonal anomalies, such as mild winters, sometimes lessen these fluctuations. Recently, the impact of seasonality on oil has been somewhat muted by overall supply and demand economics attributable to worldwide production in excess of existing worldwide demand for oil. Certain of our drilling, completion, and other operations are also subject to seasonal limitations. Seasonal weather conditions, government regulations and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business below for additional discussion. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, particularly with respect to acquiring prospective oil and natural gas properties. We believe our acreage position provides a foundation for development activities that we expect to fuel our future growth. Our competitive position also depends on our geological, geophysical, and engineering expertise, as well as our financial resources. We believe the location of our acreage; our exploration, drilling, operational, and production expertise; available technologies; our financial resources and expertise; and the experience and knowledge of our management and technical teams enable us to compete in our core operating areas. However, we face intense competition from a substantial number of major and independent oil and gas companies, which in some cases have larger technical staffs and greater financial and operational resources than we do. Many of these companies not only engage in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas reserves, but also have gathering, processing or refining operations, market refined products, own drilling rigs or other equipment, or generate electricity. 

We also compete with other oil and gas companies in securing drilling rigs and other equipment and services necessary for the drilling, completion, and maintenance of wells, as well as for the gathering, transporting and processing of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Consequently, we may face shortages, delays or increased costs in securing these services from time to time. The oil and gas industry also faces competition from alternative fuel sources, including other fossil fuels such as coal and imported liquefied natural gas. Competitive conditions may be affected by future energy, climate-related, financial, or other policies, legislation, and regulations. 

In addition, we compete for people, including experienced geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals. Throughout the oil and gas industry, the need to attract and retain talented people has grown at a time when the availability of individuals with these skills is becoming more limited due to the evolving demographics of our industry. We are not insulated from the competition for quality people, and we must compete effectively in order to be successful. 

Government Regulations 

Our business is extensively controlled by numerous federal, state, and local laws and governmental regulations. These laws and regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions, or other developments, and our regulatory burden may increase in the future. Laws and regulations have the potential to increase our cost of doing business and consequently could affect our profitability. However, we do not believe that we are affected to a materially greater or lesser extent than others in our industry. 

Energy Regulations. Many of the states in which we conduct our operations have adopted laws and regulations governing the exploration for and production of oil, gas, and NGLs, including laws and regulations requiring permits for the drilling of wells, imposing bond requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and governing the timing of drilling and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various state conservation laws and regulations, including regulations governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area, the spacing of wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws sometimes establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit or prohibit the venting or flaring of gas, and may impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. 

Some of our operations are conducted on federal lands pursuant to oil and gas leases administered by the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;). These leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed regulations and orders that are subject to change. In addition to permits required from other regulatory agencies, lessees must obtain a permit from the BLM before drilling and must comply with regulations governing, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, the valuation of production and payment of royalties, the removal of facilities, and the posting of bonds 

to ensure that lessee obligations are met. Under certain circumstances, the BLM may suspend or terminate our operations on federal leases. 

Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of gas pipeline transportation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC&#8217;s current regulatory framework generally provides for a competitive and open access market for sales and transportation of natural gas. However, FERC regulations continue to affect the midstream and transportation segments of the industry, and thus can indirectly affect the sales prices we receive for natural gas production. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

&#160; 

General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment and worker health and safety as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things: 

&#8226; 

require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences; 

&#8226; 

restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production and saltwater disposal activities; 

&#8226; 

limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, including areas containing certain wildlife or threatened and endangered plant and animal species; and 

&#8226; 

require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as closing pits and plugging abandoned wells. 

&#160; 

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent permitting, waste handling, disposal, and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 

The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. 

Waste handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;), individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced water, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA&#8217;s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to 

be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, pay fines, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 

Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States and states. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or analogous state agencies. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) addresses prevention, containment and cleanup, and liability associated with oil pollution. OPA applies to vessels, offshore platforms, and onshore facilities. OPA subjects owners of such facilities to strict liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of oil spills into jurisdictional waters. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in governmental penalties and civil liability. 

Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 

Climate change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and gas. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs . In addition to the effects of regulation, the meteorological effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our operations, including physical damage risks associated with more frequent, more intensive storms and flooding, and could adversely affect the demand for our products. 

Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of our operations are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts on protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on these species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling, completion, and production activities could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could adversely affect our future production from those areas. 

National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment to determine the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay development of some of our oil and natural gas projects. 

OSHA and other laws and regulation. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards relating to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of OSHA and comparable laws. 

Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in most of our drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act&#8217;s (the &#8220;SDWA&#8221;) Underground Injection Control Program. The federal SDWA protects the quality of the nation&#8217;s public drinking water through the adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids, including saltwater disposal fluids, into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources. 

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques, which could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs, and delays, all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, which could result in additional permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. 

We believe it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will 

not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Initiatives. We are committed to conducting our business in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the public. We set annual goals for our environmental, health and safety program focused on reducing the number of safety related incidents that occur and the number and impact of spills of produced fluids. We also periodically conduct regulatory compliance audits of our operations to ensure our compliance with all regulations and provide appropriate training for our employees. Reducing air emissions as a result of leaks, venting, or flaring of natural gas during operations has become a major focus area for regulatory efforts and for our compliance efforts. While flaring is sometimes necessary, releases of natural gas to the environment and flaring is an economic waste and reducing these volumes is a priority for us. To avoid flaring where possible, we restrict testing periods and make every effort to ensure that our production is connected to gas pipeline infrastructure as quickly as possible after well completions. We have cooperated with other producers in North Dakota in the ongoing development of recommendations to reduce the amount of flaring that is occurring there as a result of area wide infrastructure limitations that are beyond our control. Another focus for our environmental effort has been reduction of water use through recycling of flowback water in south Texas for use as frac fluid. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital costs related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital budget and are not separately itemized.

Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms 

The oil and gas terms defined in this section are used throughout this report. The definitions of the terms developed reserves, exploratory well, field, proved reserves, and undeveloped reserves have been abbreviated from the respective definitions under SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X, as amended effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2009. The entire definitions of those terms under Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X can be located through the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. 

Ad valorem tax. A tax based on the value of real estate or personal property. 

Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in reference to oil, NGLs, or other liquid hydrocarbons.

BTU. &#32;&#32;One British thermal unit, the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a one-pound mass of water by one degree Fahrenheit. 

Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to productive wells or wells capable of production. &#32; 

Developed reserves. Reserves that can be expected to be recovered: (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 

Dry hole. A well found to be incapable of producing either oil, natural gas, and/or NGLs in commercial quantities. 

Exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir beyond its known horizon. 

Fee properties. The most extensive interest that can be owned in land, including surface and mineral (including oil and natural gas) rights. 

Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. 

Finding and development cost. Expressed in dollars per BOE. Finding and development cost metrics provide information as to the cost of adding proved reserves from various activities, and are widely utilized within the exploration and production industry, as well as by investors and analysts. The information used to calculate these metrics is included in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information &#32;section in Part II, Item 8 of this report. It should be noted that finding and development cost metrics have limitations. For example, exploration efforts related to a particular set of proved reserve additions may extend over several years. As a result, the exploration costs incurred in earlier periods are not included in the amount of exploration costs incurred during the period in which that set of proved reserves is added. In addition, consistent with industry practice, future capital costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves are not included in costs incurred. Since the additional development costs that will need to be 

incurred in the future before the proved undeveloped reserves are ultimately produced are not included in the amount of costs incurred during the period in which those reserves were added, those development costs in future periods will be reflected in the costs associated with adding a different set of reserves. 

Formation. A succession of sedimentary beds that were deposited under the same general geologic conditions. 

Frac spread. Hydraulic fracturing requires custom-designed and purpose-built equipment. A &#8220;frac spread&#8221; is the equipment necessary to carry out a fracturing job. 

Gross acre. An acre in which a working interest is owned. 

Gross well. A well in which a working interest is owned. 

Horizontal wells. Wells that are drilled at angles greater than 70 degrees from vertical.

NYMEX WTI. New York Mercantile Exchange West Texas Intermediate, a common industry benchmark price for crude oil. 

NYMEX Henry Hub . New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub, a common industry benchmark price for natural gas. 

OPIS . Oil Price Information Service, a common industry benchmark for NGL pricing at Mont Belvieu, Texas. 

PV-10 (Non-GAAP). The present value of estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of estimated net proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, based on prices used in estimating the proved reserves and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and 

administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax expenses, or depreciation, depletion, and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 percent. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the Company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period. This is a non-GAAP measure. 

Productive well. A well that is producing crude oil, natural gas, and/or NGLs or that is capable of commercial production of those products. 

Proved reserves. Those quantities of oil, gas, and NGLs which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible &#8211; from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations &#8211; prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined, and the price to be used is the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

Recompletion. The completion of an existing wellbore in a formation other than that in which the well has previously been completed. 

Reserve life. Expressed in years, represents the estimated net proved reserves at a specified date divided by actual production for the preceding 12-month period. 

Reserve replacement. &#32;&#32;Reserve replacement metrics are used as indicators of a company&#8217;s ability to replenish annual production volumes and grow its reserves, and provide information related to how successful a company is at growing its proved reserve base. These are believed to be useful non-GAAP measures that are widely utilized within the exploration and production industry, as well as by investors and analysts. They are easily calculable metrics, and the information used to calculate these metrics is included in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information &#32;section of Part II, Item 8 of this report. It should be noted that reserve replacement metrics have limitations. They are limited because they typically vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisitions. Their predictive and comparative value is also limited for the same reasons. In addition, because the metrics do not embed the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, they cannot be used as a measure of value creation. 

Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil, natural gas, and/or associated liquid resources that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

Resource play. A term used to describe an accumulation of crude oil, natural gas, and/or associated liquid resources known to exist over a large areal expanse, which when compared to a conventional play typically has lower expected geological risk. 

Royalty. The amount or fee paid to the owner of mineral rights, expressed as a percentage or fraction of gross income from crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs produced and sold unencumbered by expenses relating to the drilling, completing, and operating of the affected well. 

Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and natural gas property entitling the owner to shares of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production free of costs of exploration, development, and production operations. 

Seismic. The &#32; sending of energy waves or sound waves into the earth and analyzing the wave reflections to infer the type, size, shape, and depth of subsurface rock formations. 

Shale. Fine-grained sedimentary rock composed mostly of consolidated clay or mud. Shale is the most frequently occurring sedimentary rock. 

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves based on prices used in estimating the reserves, year-end costs, and statutory tax rates, and a 10 percent annual discount rate. The information for this calculation is included in Supplemental Oil and Gas Information &#32;located in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids regardless of whether such acreage contains estimated net proved reserves. 

Undeveloped reserves. Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The applicable SEC definition of undeveloped reserves provides that undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. 

Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce, and conduct operating activities on the property and to share in the production, sales, and costs.
