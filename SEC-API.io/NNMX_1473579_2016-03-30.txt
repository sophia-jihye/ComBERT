 Item 1. Business.

1. &#160; GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 

Boston Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 24, 2009, under the name Avanyx Therapeutics, Inc. On November 10, 2010, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Boston Therapeutics, Inc., a New Hampshire corporation (&#8220;BTI&#8221;) providing for the merger of BTI into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), the issuance by the Company of 4,000,000 shares of common stock to the stockholders of BTI in exchange for 100% of the outstanding common stock of BTI, and the change of the Company&#8217;s name to Boston Therapeutics, Inc. David Platt, the Company&#8217;s former Chief Executive Officer, is a founder of BTI and was a director and minority stockholder of BTI at the time of the Merger. Dr. Platt received 400,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in connection with the Merger. Kenneth A. Tassey, Jr., who became the Company&#8217;s President shortly after the Merger, was the Chief Executive Officer, President and principal stockholder of BTI at the time of the Merger. Mr. Tassey received 3,200,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. Boston Therapeutics, headquartered in Newton, MA, (OTC: BTHE) is a leader in the field of complex carbohydrate chemistry. The Company's initial product pipeline is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic molecules for diabetes: BTI-320, a non-systemic, non-toxic, therapeutic compound designed to reduce post-meal glucose elevation, SUGARDOWN &#174;, a dietary supplement designed to reduce post-meal sugar spikes and IPOXYN, a fluid therapy intravenous drug for the prevention of necrosis and treatment of ischemia, with an initial target indication of lower limb ischemia often associated with diabetes.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited resources and operating history. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $14.5 million and $40,995 cash on hand as of December 31, 2015. We raised $1,732,000 in gross proceeds in private placements during the year ended December 31, 2015. Through March 2016, the Company has raised $402,000, from ongoing funding through a fixed price convertible note from a related party and significant shareholder. Management anticipates that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second quarter of 2016. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in raising capital or if it is successful, that such capital will be on acceptable terms. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities.

Management is currently seeking additional capital through private placements and public offerings of its common stock. In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. Without such additional capital, the Company may be required to cease operations.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue operations.

Overview

&#160;

We are a pre-clinical and clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development, outsourced contract manufacture and commercialization of carbohydrate-based therapeutic drugs and dietary supplements designed to address blood sugar management and inflammatory diseases in a safe and efficient manner.

&#160;

Currently, our lead pharmaceutical drug candidates are:

&#160;

&#183; BTI-320 , a non-systemic, carbohydrate-based compound designed to reduce post-meal elevation of blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetic patients, pre diabetic patients; and 

&#160;

&#183; I POXYN , a carbohydrate-based, injectable drug intended to prevent necrosis, or cell death, and to treat hypoxic conditions, such as diabetic foot ulcers and other vascular complications. 

&#160;

Following Phase II clinical trial results reported in 2013 and the recent Phase IIb clinical trial concluded in October 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) accepted the Investigational New Drug Application (or IND) we filed for BTI-320 to treat Type 2 diabetes and weight management. Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston will serve as the lead clinic for the multi-center, multi-country trial expected to commence in 2016 subject to our ability to raise funding. The trial is expected to enroll up to 360 patients in the 24 week study which is being designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind international multi-center study with two treatment arms. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline at 24 weeks and may be conducted at a number of international centers located in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. Development of IPOXYN is in the pre-clinical planning stage and no work has been done to date due to lack of financial resources.

&#160;

In addition, we currently sell SUGARDOWN &#174; , a non-systemic, carbohydrate-based dietary supplement designed to support healthy blood glucose levels, over the Internet and by purchase order.

We were formed on August 24, 2009 as a Delaware corporation under the name of Avanyx Therapeutics, Inc. Initially, we focused on our IPOXYN drug candidate, but halted activity on November 10, 2010, when we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Boston Therapeutics, Inc., a New Hampshire corporation, which added our BTI-320 drug candidate to our pipeline. The transaction provided for (i) the merger of the New Hampshire entity into our company, with our company being the surviving entity, (ii) the issuance by us of 4,000,000 shares of common stock to the stockholders of the New Hampshire entity as consideration for 100% of the outstanding common stock of the New Hampshire entity, and (iii) the change of our corporate name to Boston Therapeutics, Inc.

Novelty of Complex Carbohydrate Science

Carbohydrate molecules, which are essential to the transmission and recognition of cellular information, have been shown to play an important role in major diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, inflammatory disease and viral infections. We believe this offers a largely untapped area for treatment by utilizing:

&#183; in the case of BTI-320 &#160; and SUGARDOWN&#174;, modified mannan (a polymer found in plants) to lower the rise in post-prandial blood glucose (PPG, or post-meal blood sugar); and 

&#160;

&#183; in the case of IPOXYN, hemoglobin as modified by carbohydrate chemistry to deliver oxygen to cells in hypoxic condition. 

&#160;

We use naturally occurring, readily-available plant materials as starting material to create proprietary complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights and other pharmaceutical properties. These complex carbohydrate molecules are then formulated into acceptable pharmaceutical formulations. Using these novel carbohydrate-based candidate compounds that largely bind and inhibit enzymes, we are undertaking the focused pursuit of developing therapies for metabolic diseases like diabetes and other serious diseases in which enzymes have a demonstrated role in causing the disease.

Our management team, including most notably our Board Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer David Platt, Ph.D., has played a leading role in the development of complex carbohydrate science and a pipeline of carbohydrate-based therapeutics to address a variety of unmet medical needs. We believe this expertise is particularly valuable as we progress the clinical development of our products and work to expand market awareness and sales of SUGARDOWN&#174;.

BTI-320 and SUGARDOWN&#174; Mechanisms of Action

Diabetes is a chronic disease in which a patient&#8217;s inability to produce the hormone insulin in sufficient amounts or at all leads to high levels of glucose in the blood stream, which in turn can cause complications such as heart, kidney and retina disease. The modified mannan in BTI-320 tablets works to lower the rise in post-meal blood glucose in several ways. First, it binds to long-chain starch polysaccharides in food and to the digestive enzymes that cleave these large sugars into glucose. Second, it temporarily coats the inside of the small intestine to slow the absorption of glucose. Together, these mechanisms have been shown to lower the rate of absorption of glucose from the small intestine into the blood.

BTI-320 is intended to reduce the amount of glucose available for absorption into the bloodstream. Most anti-diabetes drugs, also called hypoglycemic drugs, force blood sugar levels down systemically by targeting organs such as the pancreas and the body&#8217;s cells, increasing the risk of side effects as has been evidenced in recent FDA findings. In contrast, BTI-320 targets enzymes in the mouth and small intestine to reduce the uptake of glucose during the digestion of carbohydrate foods. We believe this preemptive, non-systemic approach to blood sugar management provides for a broader safety profile. The BTI-320 profile is enhanced due to its GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) classification. SUGARDOWN&#174; has a similar mechanism of action.

In February 2013, we reported positive results from a Phase II clinical study conducted at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center that evaluated the safety and efficacy of BTI-320. The study evaluated BTI-320 in 24 patients with Type 2 diabetes between the ages of 18 and 75 with a body mass index (BMI) of 25-40 kg/m2 and with a HbA1c (a lab test that shows the average level of blood glucose over the previous three months) of less than or equal to 9 percent. The primary endpoint of this study was to demonstrate a reduction of incremental area under the curve (AUC) of post-meal blood glucose by 20%.

In this study, forty-five percent (45%) of patients responded positively with a forty percent (40%) reduction of post-meal glucose in the blood compared to baseline in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, results showed the effect of BTI-320 does not correlate with duration of diabetes, and worked regardless of concurrent diabetes medications. There was no severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar episodes), gastrointestinal side effects were mild and satiety (fullness) was observed. In the article published in the July/August 2013 issue of the peer reviewed journal, Endocrine Practice , there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) from the data analysis of the open-label dose escalation crossover trial on patients with Type 2 diabetes.

In 2012, we conducted a clinical study at the University of Sydney in Australia that showed the post-meal incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose and insulin were significantly lower following consumption of SUGARDOWN&#174; prior to a high carbohydrate meal of rice in a dose-dependent manner. This resulted in a reduction of up to 61 percent in post-meal elevation of blood glucose compared with the rice consumed alone. On average, there was a 32 percent reduction in the post-meal iAUC for glucose and a 24 percent reduction in post-meal insulin response for the volunteers in the study. No severe adverse effects were reported or observed during the study. SUGARDOWN&#174; was tested in healthy, but overweight, adults with a mean body mass index (BMI) value of 27.3 kg/m2. This clinical study indicated that SUGARDOWN&#174; can maintain healthy glucose levels even after meals, when sugar tends to spike.

In October 2014, we reported results from a Phase IIb study of BTI-320 in patients with Type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. by Accumed Research Associates. The trial enrolled 23 patients with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed for at least one year and who were on a stable daily dose of Metformin for at least three months. The patients were administered BTI-320 and Metformin using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, three-way cross-over study design. Of the 23 patients that completed the trial, 15 patients did not demonstrate a measurable response by a significant reduction from normal to the rice test meal. The remaining eight patients responded to BTI-320 with up to a 34% reduction in post meal blood glucose levels. Patients were given one to two BTI-320 tablets, half of the dose of the Dartmouth study and one third the dose of the University of Sydney trial. The results of the trial showed BTI-320 as safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported and provided information on different patient populations to be used to design the appropriate designed protocols for future clinical trials.

&#160;

IPOXYN and OXYFEX

IPOXYN &#160; is a carbohydrate-based, injectible intravenous solution that can potentially prevent hypoxic condition and cell death, and treat these hypoxic conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers and other vascular complications of diabetes. IPOXYN, a blood substitute, has a very broad range of potential applications, including but not limited to, tissue death prevention, wound healing, traumatic blood loss, traumatic brain injury, stroke, cancer, surgery, transplant and anemia. In addition, since donated human blood needs refrigeration and has a shelf life of less than one month, IPOXYN can serve as an adjunct to or replacement for donated blood in trauma and surgery cases when there are human blood supply deficiencies.

Hypoxia is a condition in which cells lack sufficient oxygen supply to support metabolic function. As evidenced by the well-established record of data relating to similar products, the IPOXYN carbohydrate molecule contains oxygen rechargeable iron which picks up oxygen in the lungs, is 5,000 times smaller than a red blood cell (or RBC), and can reach hypoxic tissue more effectively than RBCs. IPOXYN is stable at room temperature, has a three year shelf life and requires no blood type matching. We plan to introduce this product in clinical trials for hypoxic medical conditions.

Our pharmaceutical agents are intended for intravenous administration into the circulatory system to target acute and late stage diseases that, we believe, have a great unmet medical need. Acute hypoxic conditions, which we intend to treat with IPOXYN, result from a lack of oxygen supply to living cells. Hypoxia will lead to ischemia, inflammation and the death of living cells. Ischemia is a restriction in blood supply, generally due to factors in the blood vessels, with resultant damage or dysfunction of tissue. Diabetic foot ulcer, which occurs in 15% of patients with diabetes and precedes more than 80% of all lower leg amputations, is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus. Two major risk factors that cause diabetic foot ulcer are diabetic neuropathy and micro/macro ischemia. Increases in mortality among diabetic patients observed over the past 20 years are considered to be due to the development of macro and micro vascular complications including the failure of the wound healing process. A failure of effective treatment of wounds in this population can often lead to infection, tissue death and amputation of the lower leg and foot as the only treatment option. We believe that IPOXYN represents a potentially effective treatment for lower limb complications of diabetes.

We are also developing OXYFEX, a veterinary analog to IPOXYN. We are unaware of any drug currently on the market for animals that can deliver oxygen, and there is only limited &#8220;blood banking&#8221; for animals despite a constant need. OXYFEX&#8482; can serve as the only available oxygen delivery mechanism for animals suffering ischemia or traumatic and surgical blood loss events.

IPOXYN and OXYFEX consist of a stabilized glycoprotein composition containing oxygen-rechargeable iron, targeting both human and animal tissues and organ systems deprived of oxygen and in need of metabolic support. We have not conducted any clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of, or filed any applications with the FDA with respect to, IPOXYN. We are in the process of developing IPOXYN for pre-clinical studies, in order to conduct clinical trials and to file applications with the FDA as applicable. We expect to file an IND application with the FDA in 2017, provided we obtain adequate funding. We expect to have access to the pilot-scale manufacturing facility of a third party with adequate capacity to produce &#160; IPOXYN for clinical trials and market introduction.

We have access, subject to adequate funding, to both sufficient raw materials at commodity pricing and processing facilities to produce sufficient quantities of IPOXYN to complete pre-clinical pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy studies in support of an investigative new drug (IND) filing in the United States in 2017. The primary raw material for IPOXYN is extracted from controlled sourced bovine blood which can be obtained from multiple sources at commodity prices under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). There are numerous facilities capable of processing source verified red blood cell extract. We expect to put in place agreements for obtaining and processing these materials upon funding.

Drug Development Status

&#160;

BTI-320 is our lead product candidate and is currently in Phase II clinical development. We have not initiated any trials or filed any applications with the United States Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) for IPOXYN. Following Phase II clinical trial results reported in 2013 and the Phase IIb clinical trial concluded in October 2014, the FDA accepted the Investigational New Drug Application (or IND) We proposed for BTI-320 to treat Type 2 diabetes and weight management. Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston will serve as the lead clinic for the multi-center, multi-country trial that may commence in 2016 subject to use receiving adequate funding. The trial may enroll up to 360 patients in the 24 week study which is being designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind international multi-center study with two treatment arms. One of the primary endpoints of efficacy of the trial is the mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline at 24 weeks. This is anticipated to be conducted at a number of international centers located in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. Development of IPOXYN is in the pre-clinical planning stage and further development is on hold pending the securing of adequate funding.

&#160;

BTI-320

&#160;

In March 2014, following the successful results of the Dartmouth study, we received and additional Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to initiate a clinical study of BTI-320 in the United States. In October 2014, we completed a Phase II trial in the United States and we are currently delaying any additional Phase II trial efforts in France due to enrollment performance issues and lack of resources to support the effort.. These trials were designed to add CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) and better define PPG effects that support the results from our Dartmouth study for BTI-320. In the Dartmouth study, BTI-320 was well tolerated in patients taking various anti-diabetic agents, including Metformin. The recent additional clinical trial in the U.S. showed BTI-320 was safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. The FDA has accepted an IND which was filed for BTI-320 to treat Type 2 Diabetes and weight management. Subject to adequate funding, we tentatively are planning to commence additional clinical trials in 2016 for BTI-320. 

&#160;

IPOXYN

We believe IPOXYN is a safe and effective intervention for reversing acute hypoxia, fulfilling an unmet clinical need; and that IPOXYN can alleviate acute deficiency of oxygen and avert further life threatening complications and muscle and tissue death which can result from a sustained deficiency of oxygen. Our belief about the safety and efficacy of IPOXYN is based on preliminary good laboratory practices (GLP) testing of a material that is bio-similar to IPOXYN, where it was found that such bio-similar formulation had no material toxicity on a small group of animals. We understand that this testing of GLP produced bio-similar materials or, for that matter, pre-clinical testing, will not necessarily predict levels of toxicity and efficacy in humans. However, if clinical trials ultimately support this belief, in many clinical situations IPOXYN could become a significant new management tool to moderate the inconsistencies of RBC transfusion.

In addition to the expansive and broad application development in the field of human medical management, we envision a sizable market in the veterinary field and expect to make a registration filing for this market as soon as we can complete pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies. Clinical safety and efficacy studies under Good Manufacturing Practices have not yet been initiated.

&#160;

Preliminary data from animal testing conducted by third parties suggests successful use of OXYFEX in hypoxia and critical anemic situations, where hypoxic conditions were critical to animal survival. Early experiments with dogs suggest intervention with OXYFEX will significantly improve survival in induced canine anemia models. This veterinary treatment of signs and symptom of canine anemia will be our first target for seeking early regulatory approval in the European Union. As there is substantial commonality between the metabolic functions of humans and other mammals, animal testing becomes a starting point for many clinical development programs that can directly translate into clinical development programs for humans. The third party testing described here was conducted by a company that developed a bio-similar product to OXTFEX. Testing included repeated intravenous infusions of the product in dogs that was reported in well documented literature and regulatory filings, and the testing did not result in reported mortality/morbidity of the subject animals. Reports concerning anemic dogs infused with the bio-similar product showed increased plasma hemoglobin levels resulting in an increase of the oxygen carrying capacity of the treated animals. We have no agreements with the third party that conducted these toxicity tests, or its successors. No further development work has been conducted on IPOXYN pending securing adequate funding and finalizing strategy as to the best development plan.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

Diabetes

According to the International Diabetes Federation, in 2013, 382 million people worldwide are living with diabetes and that number is projected to increase to 592 million by 2035. In the United States alone, the Center for Disease Control estimated that there were 26 million people living with diabetes and an estimated 79 million people who were pre-diabetic in 2011. Standard therapies for diabetes include physician recommended diet and exercise, oral hypoglycemic drugs such as Metformin for Type 2 diabetes and insulin injection regimens for people with Type 1 diabetes. The objective of each is to maintain a daily blood glucose level range recommended by a physician. Each of the current therapies alone has its limitations including numerous side effects.

According to Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, the diabetes drug market is estimated to be $35 billion and is on pace to grow to more than $58 billion by 2018. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigating new approaches to treating diabetes and market value has been maintained in the industry due to the introduction of these new products. We believe that BTI-320 represents a near-term commercial opportunity in a large and growing diabetes market. BTI-320 is pharmacologically differentiated from commercially available PPG drugs.

We believe that many patients with diabetes have suboptimal relief with the use of the above therapies alone or in combination with each other. In addition, other types of PPGs are only effective by themselves in the early stages of impaired glucose tolerance. Our BTI-320 oral formulation is a new class of drug for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Human testing to date has shown that it is safe and non-systemic with a benign side effect profile that will be used for the treatment of diabetes. We believe BTI-320 has the potential to be an adjunctive therapy when combined with Metformin, the most prescribed diabetes drug in the U.S. with 50 million prescriptions annually.

Hypoxia

Development of IPOXYN is in the pre-clinical stage and no work has been done to date due to the lack of funding. Our injectable drug candidate, IPOXYN, will potentially compete with existing therapies for the treatment of hypoxia or anti-necrosis that according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. has a global market opportunity of $1 billion. Hypoxia is a condition in which cells lack sufficient oxygen supply to support metabolic function. The standard therapy for acute anemia resulting from blood loss is infusion of RBCs mainly from supplies of donated blood. For prophylactic or long-term treatment of anticipated or chronic anemia, medications that stimulate the creation of new RBCs are frequently used.

Presently, there is no substitute for human red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the body; and transfusions involve certain risks and limitations. The standard therapy for reversing hypoxia is blood infusion, RBCs or hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric medicine or hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical term for using oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. The HBOT treatment can only be done at a medical facility and each session can cost from $200 to more than $1,000. For decades, oxygen carriers have been developed for perfusion and oxygenation of ischemic tissue; none have yet succeeded in becoming an artificial blood component or blood substitute. These products were either blood-derived elements, synthetic perfluorocarbons, or red blood cell modifiers. According to a Brown University study, there is a global shortage of transfusion suitable blood of 110 million units, and the need for blood is rising 6-7% annually. IPOXYN, a blood substitute, has a broad range of potential applications, including but not limited to, tissue death prevention, wound healing, traumatic blood loss, traumatic brain injury, stroke, cancer, surgery, transplant and anemia.

Veterinary Market

Development of OXYFEX&#8482; is in the pre-clinical stage and no work has been done to date due to the lack of funding. We plan to commence marketing OXYFEX&#8482; for veterinary applications, which we view as a potentially lucrative market, once we receive the necessary approvals in the U.S. and globally. As of now, no development work has been conducted on OXYFEX pending securing adequate funding and finalizing strategy as to the development plan. We estimate that there are at least 15,000 small animal veterinary practices in the United States, another 4,000 mixed animal practices treating small and large animals in the United States and approximately 22,000 small animal practices in Europe. We believe that the average veterinary practice treats only a small percentage of canine anemia cases with red blood cell transfusion. The remaining animals receive either cage rest or treatment such as fluid administration, iron supplements, dietary supplements or inspired oxygen.

&#160;

Our Product Candidates

&#160;

Our primary business is the development, manufacture and commercialization of therapeutic drugs with a focus on complex carbohydrate chemistry to address diabetes and inflammatory diseases. We are currently focusing on drug candidates. BTI-320, a non-systemic, non-toxic, drug candidate taken before carbohydrate meals, is designed to improve post-meal blood sugar control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

&#160;

Currently we are not developing IPOXYN pending securing adequate financing and finalizing strategy as to the best development plan. We may also develop IPOXYN, an injectable drug candidate for prevention of necrosis and treatment of hypoxia. IPOXYN is a polysaccharide based therapeutic agent using proprietary processes and patented technology. Our IPOXYN drug consists of a stabilized polysaccharide composition containing oxygen-rechargeable iron, targeting both human and animal tissues and organ systems deprived of oxygen and in need of metabolic support.

According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market opportunity for anti-hypoxia or anti-necrosis technology is $1 billion. Early entry global markets include the following:

&#183; Military 

&#183; Asia (replace Hepatitis C contaminated blood products) 

&#183; Africa (AIDS contaminated blood) 

&#183; Newborns 

&#183; Trauma 

&#183; Lower Limb Ischemia and other vascular complications of diabetes 

BTI-320

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

BTI-320 is our lead product candidate and is currently in Phase II clinical development. Subject to us obtaining adequate funding, we expect to begin additional clinical trials in 2016.

BTI-320 is a Carbohydrate Hydrolyzing Enzyme Inhibitors (CHEI) for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. BTI-320 initially targets improved management of post-meal blood sugar in patients currently taking Metformin and potentially other anti-diabetic agents.

BTI-320, a non-systemic, non-toxic, drug candidate taken before carbohydrate meals, is designed to improve post-meal blood glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. BTI-320 acts non-systemically in the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit the enzymes that cleave complex carbohydrates from foods into simple sugars, reducing available glucose during the period following a meal. BTI-320 initially targets improved management of post-meal blood sugar in patients currently taking Metformin and potentially other anti-diabetic agents.

&#160;

According to the International Diabetes Federations 2011 report, Guideline for Management of Post-meal Glucose in Diabetes, addressing both post-meal plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose is an important strategy for achieving optimal glucose control, and that evidence points to a relationship between an acute increase in blood sugar, particularly after a meal, and cardiovascular disease. We completed a BTI-320 Phase II clinical trial in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

Status of Development of BTI-320

&#160;

BTI-320 is fully developed as a drug candidate. In October 2011, we announced the initiation of our clinical trial at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BTI-320 when added to oral agents or insulin regimen in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. In July 2012, we announced the completion of patient enrollment. In February 2013, we announced that BTI-320 reduced the elevation of post-meal blood sugar by forty percent with no serious adverse events. The study evaluated BTI-320 in 24 patients with Type 2 diabetes between the ages of 18 and 75 with a body mass index (BMI) of 25-40 kg/m2 and with HbA1c of less than or equal to nine percent. HbA1c is a lab test that indicates the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous three months.

&#160;

Forty-five percent of patients responded with an average forty percent reduction of post-meal glucose in the blood compared to baseline in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, results showed the effect of BTI-320 does not correlate with duration of diabetes and works regardless of concurrent diabetes medications. There was no severe hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal side effects were mild. Satiety was also observed. There were no serious adverse events from the data analysis of the open-label dose escalation crossover trial on Type 2 diabetic patients.

&#160;

The full article for the clinical study was published in the July/August 2013 issue of Endocrine Practice , a peer-reviewed journal.

In October 2014, we reported results from a Phase IIb study of BTI-320 in patients with Type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. by Accumed Research Associates. The trial enrolled 23 patients with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed for at least one year and who were on a stable daily dose of Metformin for at least three months. The patients were administered BTI-320 and Metformin using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, three-way cross-over study design. Of the 23 patients that completed the trial, 15 patients did not yield measurement differences from normal to the rice test meal. The remaining eight patients responded to BTI-320 with up to a 34% reduction in post meal blood glucose levels. Patients were given one to two BTI-320 tablets, half of the dose of the Dartmouth study and one third the dose of the University of Sydney trial. The results of the trial showed BTI-320 as safe and well tolerated, with no servious adverse events reported and provided information on different patient populations to be used to design the proper protocols for future clinical trials.

&#160;

Products Competitive with BTI-320

&#160;

Anti-diabetic drugs. Anti-diabetic drugs treat diabetes mellitus by lowering glucose levels in the blood. With the exceptions of insulin, insulin analogues and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Agonists, all are administered orally and are thus also called oral hypoglycemic agents or oral anti-hyperglycemic agents. There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs, and their selection depends on the nature of the diabetes, age and situation of the person, as well as other factors. BTI-320 is the first compound in a new class of therapies called Carbohydrate-Hydrolyzing Enzyme Inhibitor (CHEI) for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. BTI-320 acts non-systematically in the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit the enzymes that cleave complex carbohydrates from foods into simple sugars, reducing postprandial glucose excursion (post-meal blood sugar elevation).

Secretagogues. Secretagogues, which include Sulfonylureas and Meglitinides, help enhance insulin secretion. Sulfonylureas were the first widely used oral hypoglycemic medications. They are insulin secretagogues , triggering insulin release by direct action on the KATP channel of the pancreatic beta cells . Glipizide (Glucotrol&#174;) falls into this category with side effects including GI discomfort, diarrhea and hypoglycemia.

Sensitizers. Insulin sensitizers address the core problem in Type 2 diabetes&#8212;insulin resistance&#8212;and include Biguanides and Thiazolidinediones. Among oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin sensitizers are the largest category. Biguanides &#160; reduce hepatic glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery, including skeletal muscle. Although it must be used with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, metformin, a biguanide, has become the most commonly used agent for Type 2 diabetes in children and teenagers. Amongst common diabetic drugs, Metformin is the only widely used oral drug that does not cause weight gain. Metformin is the most prescribed drug in this category whose side effects may be hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

&#160;

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also known as &#8220;glitazones,&#8221; bind to PPAR&#947;, a type of nuclear regulatory protein involved in transcription of genes reg ulating glucose and fat metabolism. Rosiglitazone (Avandia&#174;) and Pioglitazone (Actos&#174;) fall into this category of anti-diabetic agent. 

&#160;

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors &#160; are &#8220;diabetes pills&#8221; but not technically hypoglycemic agents because they do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity. These agents slow the digestion of starch in the small intestine, so that glucose from the starch of a meal enters the bloodstream more slowly, and can be matched more effectively by an impaired insulin response or sensitivity. These agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of impaired glucose tolerance, but can be helpful in combination with other agents in Type 2 diabetes. Acarbose, marketed as Prandase&#174; and Glucobay&#174; is an Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitor.

IPOXYN and OXYFEX&#8482;

&#160;

Development of IPOXYN is in the pre-clinical stage and no work has been done to date due to the lack of funding. IPOXYN is designed for delivery as an intravenous solution, with the expectation that it can replenish an inadequate supply of oxygen and support various metabolic functions in the body in a manner and with effects similar to those resulting from the infusion of available RBCs - and without the limitations of compatibility, availability, short shelf life, volume and logistical challenges commonly associated with transfusions of whole blood and packed red blood cells. Other intravenous fluids commonly used in emergency trauma to restore blood volume, such as Ringer&#8217;s lactate or saline, are not designed to and do not effectively carry oxygen. We have not conducted any clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of, or filed any applications with the FDA with respect to, IPOXYN. IPOXYN will not be ready for commercialization until these steps are completed. Preclinical animal study results for IPOXYN were presented at the XIII International Symposium on Blood Substitutes and Oxygen Therapeutics in July 2011.

&#160;

Upon securing adequate funding, we plan to introduce this investigational product in clinical trials for hypoxic medical conditions. Hypoxia promotes resistance to conventional treatments, as well as treatments for other diseases. IPOXYN has the potential to greatly improve survival of patients in multiple indications in which hypoxia is a factor. Hypoxia is a condition in which cells lack sufficient oxygen supply to support normal metabolic functions. It is widely known through research that lack of oxygen will result in a cascade of biochemical reactions which promote resistance to many helpful therapeutic substances and which interfere with the body&#8217;s own repair mechanisms. Antibiotics for the treatment of infection are less effective when hypoxic conditions are involved. Similarly, hypoxic cancer cells are resistant to chemotherapy treatments; most chemotherapy drugs rely on rapid cell division which requires normal oxygenation of cells, but in a hypoxic condition, cells proliferate by other pathways and therefore resist many chemotherapy treatments.

&#160;

Another unmet clinical need is in various acute ischemic conditions, where hypoxia can develop from a local restriction of constrained blood vessels, or poor and compromised flow which leads to insufficient supply of oxygen by otherwise well-oxygenated and distributed RBCs, e.g. cerebral ischemia, ischemic heart disease and intrauterine hypoxia which is an unchallenged cause of perinatal death. In these cases IPOXYN, as a rechargeable soluble oxygen delivery agent, may not be restrained whereas well-oxygenated RBCs may be prevented due to size from free flow and distribution and thus the delivery of oxygen. RBCs are large biological structures compared to the size of IPOXYN, which is a modified single-protein function oxygen carrier. In ischemic and hypoxic conditions, RBCs may not be able to penetrate the small vessels which have lost their ability to permit RBC distribution and thus oxygen delivery. Due to its small molecular size, IPOXYN can carry and distribute oxygen widely without risk of clot formation and flow stoppage.

&#160;

In veterinary medicine applications, OXYFEX&#8482; will be used as an oxygen delivery agent similar to a blood substitute for ischemia and trauma, as well as for blood loss during surgery.

&#160;

Status of development of IPOXYN

&#160;

We are in the process of developing IPOXYN for pre-clinical studies, in order to conduct clinical trials and to file applications with the FDA as applicable.

Products Competitive with IPOXYN

&#160;

Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new technologies for the treatment of hypoxia and other diseases. The standard therapy for reversing hypoxia due to acute blood loss may be blood infusion, RBCs or hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric medicine, also known as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), is the medical terminology for using oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. There are many conditions being treated using this approach including acute blood loss (Hart GB, Lennon PA, Strauss MB. (1987) &#8220;Hyperbaric oxygen in exceptional acute blood-loss anemia,&#8221; J. Hyperbaric Med 2 (4): 205&#8211;210). In the United States, HBOT is recognized as a reimbursable treatment for 14 &#8220;approved&#8221; conditions and an HBOT session can cost anywhere from $200 in private clinics, to over $1,000 in hospitals. The most common intervention in hypoxic patients is RBC transfusion. The need for intervention to reduce hypoxia can also be affected by medical conditions such as ischemia or cardiopulmonary failure, claudication (cramping caused by blocked arteries in the leg), poor perfusion and other indications, where a combination of below optimal flow and capacity are compromising oxygen delivery.

When compared to RBC transfusion, we believe IPOXYN will have the following advantages:

&#183; Availability: readily available, with at least two year shelf-life (much longer than the five week plus shelf life for RBCs) and easier to perfuse. 

&#183; Stability: stored at room temperature for years while maintaining its full capacity for oxygen delivery and release and logistical convenience. 

&#160;

&#183; Sterile: when manufactured and processed consistently through good manufacturing practices, free of infectious agents and unnecessary elements. 

&#160;

&#183; Compatibility: safe for all blood types in a wide range of conditions and does not require pre-infusion typing or testing for compatibility. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Critical care : IPOXYN can be safely applied outside the hospital to treat or prevent ischemic conditions in cases like shock and trauma, heart attack or stroke where low flow or suspended local flow are disrupted. A readily available infusion package makes it a straightforward tool for emergency medical teams to use on site in order to save a patient&#8217;s life, when time is of the essence for survival. 

&#160;

&#183; Molecular structure : Chemically, IPOXYN features a small molecular size compared to RBCs, so it possesses better flow characteristics and circumvents constricted and partially occluded vessels that restrict flow of RBCs and thus the supply of oxygen to tissues and organs. 

&#160;

&#183; Oxygenation : Due to its high solubility, it has high capacity and faster exchange of oxygen in tissues, as well as facilitating the release of oxygen from RBCs for overall unparalled efficiency. 

&#160;

For chronic anemia situations, erythropoietin-based formulations are available from two suppliers. Erythropoietin stimulates the erythropoietic system in the bone marrow to produce its own RBCs. These products are slow acting, and only administered in anticipation of blood loss during surgery, and are not effective for temporary use or in emergency situations when acute blood loss requires RBC infusion to deliver oxygen.

The fields of treatment of oxygen-deprived states have been approached in many ways. These include such techniques as high oxygen concentration, hyperbaric chambers, as well as the more mechanical approaches of vessel dilation and blood thinning. All have met with minor measures of improvement. In the early 1980&#8217;s a number of companies focused on creating specific oxygen carriers that were either (a) blood derived elements, (b) synthetics consisting of Perfluoro chemicals or (c) elements created using recombinant and molecular engineering approaches (red cell modifiers). Companies including Baxter, Abbot, and Biopure and OPK Biotech, for example, used the blood derived approach; Green Cross, Alliance Pharmaceuticals and Synthetic blood focused on synthetics, and Somatogen and Allos Therapeutics tried recombinant and molecular engineering. All of these approaches were early attempts to meet a need whose main focus has been on a &#8220;blood substitute&#8221;. &#160; Our approach is fundamentally different. Instead of a blood substitute, we are offering a new chemical entity that will deliver oxygen to hypoxic cells.

&#160;

We are aware of other companies researching the use of hemoglobin as a therapeutic, including programs in China and Japan. We expect IPOXYN to compete with traditional therapies and with other oxygen delivery pharmaceuticals. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial and other resources to develop, manufacture and market their products. We believe the most immediate competition comes from companies currently conducting clinical trials of investigational hemoglobin solutions.

&#160;

We believe that these programs are in the preclinical stage of development. We believe that our use of bovine red blood cells for the production of IPOXYN is an advantage over products made from donated human red blood cells stored for a long period of time and other competitive approaches because of the availability, abundance, ability to control source, cost and relative safety of bovine red blood cells.

SUGARDOWN&#174;

We have developed and currently produce and sell SUGARDOWN&#174;, a non-systemic complex carbohydrate-based dietary food supplement to support healthy post-meal blood glucose using proprietary processes and technology. We have unrestricted access to both sufficient raw materials at commodity pricing and processing facilities to produce sufficient supply of SUGARDOWN&#174; to support product distribution across multiple sales channels as a dietary supplement. Our SUGARDOWN&#174; dietary supplement consists of a complex carbohydrate composition.

Status of Development of SUGARDOWN&#174;

We completed development of SUGARDOWN &#174; as an over the counter (OTC) dietary supplement. We filed a structure and function claim application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to SUGARDOWN &#174;, which describes the proposed mechanism of action of SUGARDOWN &#174; in reducing post-meal elevation of glucose in the blood. We have submitted thirty structural and functional claims with the FDA. We currently have strategically filed national stage patent applications pending that are directed to the Composition of purified mannanns, which are utilized in the formulation of SUGARDOWN &#174;. We have also received a registered mark for SUGARDOWN &#174; . General Product Liability Insurance for SUGARDOWN &#174; has been in effect since April 2010. On January 24, 2012, we announced the clinical test results in healthy volunteers performed at the Sydney University Glycemic Institute for Research with SUGARDOWN &#174; . On January 28, 2013, we announced the final results of the study conducted at the University of Sydney that showed the post- meal incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose and insulin were significantly lower following consumption of SUGARDOWN &#174; tablets prior to a high carbohydrate meal of rice in a dose-dependent manner. This resulted in a reduction of up to 61% in post-meal elevation of blood glucose compared with the rice consumed alone. On average, there was a 25.5% reduction in the post-meal iAUC for glucose and a 20% reduction in post-meal insulin response for the 10 volunteers in the study. No severe adverse effects were reported or observed during the study.

Licensing Agreement with Advance Pharmaceutical Company

&#160;

On June 24, 2011, we entered into a definitive Licensing and Manufacturing Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Advance Pharmaceutical Company (&#8220;Advance Pharmaceutical&#8221;), a Hong Kong-based, privately-held company and a significant stockholder of ours.

&#160;

Under terms of the Agreement, we will manufacture and supply product in bulk for Advance Pharmaceutical. Advance Pharmaceutical may be responsible for the packaging, marketing and distribution of SUGARDOWN&#8482; in Hong Kong, China and Macau. In November 2014, we agreed to expand their marketing agreement to include 12 additional countries: Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Brunei and Cambodia. In March 2015, we agreed to expand their marketing agreement to include Japan. Advance Pharmaceutical will also have rights to develop and manufacture SUGARDOWN&#8482; for commercial sale in these countries, subject to establishment of quality assurance and quality control standards set forth by us. The Agreement provides that Advance Pharmaceutical will pay royalties to us for SUGARDOWN&#8482; and related products developed by us and a reduced royalty rate for products based on our intellectual property and developed by Advance Pharmaceutical. Revenue generated through this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $70,000 and $182,000, respectively. 

&#160;

Marketing SUGARDOWN&#174;

&#160;

We believe SUGARDOWN&#174; is a safe and effective dietary supplement that can help support healthy after-meal blood sugar and support a weight management plan by helping to curb appetite if taken before meals. The product is ready for limited market release and is currently available for distribution in some Asian markets and is available for sale in the U.S. through our product website, www.sugardown.com .

To date, our marketing plan for SUGARDOWN &#174; has been to out-license marketing rights to strategic partners in their jurisdictions of expertise. In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Advance Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., our Hong Kong-based strategic partner that is also a significant stockholder of ours, to develop markets for SUGARDOWN &#174; in Hong Kong, China and Macau. (See licensing partnership above) 

On May 14, 2014, we entered into a definitive Marketing Agreement with Benchworks SD, LLC (Benchworks), a company engaged in the marketing, promotion and offering for distribution and sale of pharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Benchworks the exclusive right to promote, market, sell and distribute SUGARDOWN&#174; in North America for an initial term of one year, subject to extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Benchworks was responsible and bears the expense for marketing and commercializing SUGARDOWN&#174;, including the creation and payment for marketing, creative and promotional materials. The agreement defined certain minimum net sales levels that Benchworks was to achieve to maintain exclusivity. The agreement called for net sales splits with Benchworks receiving 65% of the first $10 million in net sales from the sale of SUGARDOWN&#174; in North America, with a declining share to 50% for net sales in excess of $40 million. This agreement was terminated in July 2015. We have initiated some limited new approaches to selling SUGARDOWN&#174; in North America and have begun a limited sales and marketing campaign in markets in the New England and Florida areas. We have begun radio advertising in these markets as well as defined enhancements with our social media outlets.

Overview of Diabetes

Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus, known simply as diabetes, is a chronic metabolic disorder in which a person has abnormally high levels of glucose in the circulating blood. This condition is caused by a failure of the pancreas to produce insulin and/or an inability of the body to respond adequately to circulating insulin. When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, it can lead to diabetes complications, which include limb Ischemia and neuropathy, retinopathy, kidney, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes affected approximately 26 million people in the United States in 2011. The estimated cost of diabetes in the United States alone is $245 billion, according to a study commissioned by the American Diabetes Association entitled, Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. in 2012. 

&#160;

Pre-Diabetes

&#160;

Pre-diabetes is the state in which a person has higher than normal blood glucose level, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. While in this range between normal and diabetic, patients are at risk for not only developing Type 2 diabetes, but also for cardiovascular complications. According to the CDC, pre-diabetes affected an estimated 79 million Americans in 2010.

&#160;

Diabetes Mellitus is categorized into three general areas:

&#160;

Type 1 diabetes: results from the body&#8217;s failure to produce insulin, and presently requires the person to inject insulin. Only 5-10% of people with diabetes have this form of the disease. It is considered an auto-immune disease, since the body&#8217;s immune system attacks and destroys insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas.

&#160;

Type 2 diabetes: results from insulin resistance by the body&#8217;s cells, deficient insulin production by the Pancreas or a combination of both. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the cells in the body ignore or have become desensitized to insulin.

&#160;

Gestational diabetes: is determined when pregnant women, who have never had diabetes before, have a high blood glucose level during pregnancy. It may precede development of Type 2 diabetes and affects approximately 4% of all pregnant women.

&#160;

People with Type 2 and Type 1 diabetes generally manage their blood glucose level on a meal-to-meal basis. High levels of glucose in the bloodstream for prolonged periods can lead to complications of diabetes caused by reduced oxygen supply and nerve tissue damage to eyes, kidney, brain, heart and limbs.

&#160;

Standard therapies for diabetes include physician-recommended exercise and diet, oral hypoglycemic drugs such as Metformin for Type 2 diabetics, and insulin injection regimens for Type 1 diabetics. The objective of each is to maintain a daily blood glucose level range recommended by a physician.

Overview of Hypoxia

&#160;

Hypoxic conditions are detrimental to maintaining normal functionality in all living tissues. In mammals, red blood cells (RBCs) deliver oxygen throughout the body using red blood cell contained (RBC) hemoglobin, a protein responsible for carrying and releasing oxygen to the body&#8217;s tissues. Under normal conditions, approximately 98% of oxygen is delivered by hemoglobin in the RBCs, while less than two percent is dissolved in the plasma, the fluid part of the blood.

&#160;

As the heart pumps blood, RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs and carry it to various parts of the body. Blood travels through progressively smaller blood vessels to the capillaries, some of which are so narrow that RBCs can only pass through them in single file. Most of the oxygen release occurs in the capillaries. Oxygen depleted RBCs return to the lungs to be reloaded. Adequate blood flow, pressure and RBC counts are crucial to this process. Hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, even for several minutes, can result in cell damage, organ dysfunction and, if prolonged, death.

&#160;

The causes of inadequate tissue oxygenation generally can be classified into three major categories:

Ischemia : inadequate RBC flow for tissue oxygenation. Ischemia may be caused by obstructed or constricted blood vessels and can lead to stroke, heart attack or other organ or tissue dysfunction.

&#160;

Cardiopulmonary failure : impaired function of the heart or lungs. Cardiopulmonary failure may be caused by the inability of the heart to pump sufficient quantities of blood to meet the needs of the tissues or the failure of the lungs to oxygenate blood adequately.

Anemia: insufficient RBCs in circulation. This condition can be caused by chronic disorders affecting RBCs functionality or production like chemotherapy and radiation for treatment of cancer, or blood borne diseases like bone marrow diseases. Anemia may be also caused by acute blood loss from accidental injury or surgery.

&#160;

&#160;

The standard therapy for acute anemia resulting from blood loss is infusion of RBCs mainly from supplies of donated blood. For prophylactic or long-term treatment of anticipated or chronic anemia, medications that stimulate the creation of new RBCs are frequently used.

&#160;

Presently, there is no substitute for human blood to deliver oxygen to the body; and transfusions involve certain risks and limitations. Despite the effort by blood banks around the world to screen the blood supply for HIV, hepatitis and other blood borne diseases, there is a continuing risk of an unsafe blood supply in many parts of the world; donated blood continues to carry the risk of disease transmission.

&#160;

Blood compatibility and handling and storage requirements and limitations limit the use of RBCs transfusions to hospital environment only. Shortages of certain types of blood thus occur due to seasonal factors or disasters. Since RBCs&#8217; oxygen-delivering capacity breaks down with storage (approximately 75% capacity remains after eight days of storage) their shelf-life is less than 42 days, limiting the ability for significant stockpiles of RBCs. In addition, for ischemic conditions due to constricted blood vessels where normal passage of RBCs is restricted or due to impaired heart or lung function, RBC transfusions are generally not effective.

&#160;

Business Strategy

Our business strategy primarily consists of the following:

&#183; to advance our leading clinical stage drug candidates, BTI-320 and IPOXYN, through staged regulatory approvals in the United States and the European Union and, if successful, to commercialize BTI-320 and IPOXYN either on our own or with one or more strategic partners in the U.S. and/or outside of the U.S.; and 

&#160;

&#183; to drive brand awareness and increase sales of SUGARDOWN&#174; in North America and globally in 2016 and beyond and to further study the potential beneficial characteristics of SUGARDOWN&#174;. 

We intend to continue to establish and implement clinical development programs that add value to our business in the shortest period of time possible and to seek strategic partners when a program becomes advanced and requires additional resources. We intend to continue focusing our expertise and resources to develop novel formulations, and to leverage development partnerships to apply our complex carbohydrate chemistry design in other medical indications. We may seek to enter into licensing, co-marketing, or co-development agreements across different geographic regions, in order to avail ourselves of the marketing expertise of one or more seasoned marketing and/or pharmaceutical companies. Our strategy is to leverage considerable industry experience, expertise in complex carbohydrate chemistry and clinical development experience to continue to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates with strong market potential that can fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory diseases. We plan to further develop new and proprietary drug candidates to provide improved efficacy and safety by using novel development pathways specific to each candidate.

&#160;

A core part of our strategy relies upon creating safe and efficacious drug formulations that can be administered as standalone therapies or in combination with existing medications. We believe we utilize a novel approach that is expected to create safe and efficacious drug formulations that can be combined with existing therapies and potentially deliver valuable products in areas of high unmet medical needs. In 2014, we assembled a scientific advisory board consisting of scientists with both academic and corporate research and development experience that will provide leadership and counsel in the scientific, technological and regulatory aspects of our current and future projects. In addition, we have assembled a medical advisory board consisting of leading physicians and key opinion leaders who have participated in relevant clinical studies and who will guide us through ongoing clinical trial programs. Our scientific and medical advisory boards consist of some of the leading scientists, medical doctors and professionals in the carbohydrate and diabetes fields.

&#160;

We believe that our highly experienced drug development leadership provides us with a significant competitive advantage in designing highly efficient clinical programs to deliver valuable products in areas of high unmet medical needs. 

&#160;

Key Strengths

&#160;

We believe that our key differentiating elements include:

&#183; Focus on novel therapeutic opportunities provided by carbohydrates: We are focused on development of carbohydrate-based compounds to better manage blood glucose and anti-necrosis or hypoxia therapeutics. As a result of its structural complexity, carbohydrates have not received as much scientific attention as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbohydrate-based therapeutics have proven to be efficacious and safe, while elimination many common side effects from other types of drugs. 

&#160;

&#183; Experienced management: Our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, &#160; David Platt, Ph.D., is a chemical engineer, a pioneer in designing drugs made from carbohydrates, and has more than 30 years of experience in the development of therapeutic drugs. He is the inventor or co-inventor on a number of patents. He has been involved in the FDA approval process for several drugs, and we anticipate that his expertise will be critical as we develop our product candidates through clinical trials and FDA approval process. We are the third company founded by Dr. Platt. The first two are International Gene Group, which later became Prospect Therapeutics, and is now known as LaJolla Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: LJPC), and Pro-Pharmaceuticals (now Galectin Therapeutics) (Nasdaq: GALT). LJPC is applying its carbohydrate-based technologies in cancer and chronic kidney disease and GALT is focused on liver fibrosis and cancer. Their core technologies were either developed or co-developed by Dr. Platt. Our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, David Platt, has been a leading pioneer in the area of complex carbohydrates for over 30 years and has significant experience developing pharmaceutical drug candidates. Furthermore, we assembled a scientific advisory board consisting of scientists with both academic and corporate research and development experience that will provide leadership and counsel in the scientific, technological and regulatory aspects of our current and future projects. In addition, we have assembled a medical advisory board consisting of leading physicians and key opinion leaders who have participated in relevant clinical studies and who will guide us through ongoing clinical trial programs. Our scientific and medical advisory boards consist of some of the leading scientists, medical doctors and professionals in the carbohydrate and diabetes fields. While Dr. Platt resigned as our Chief Executive Officer in March 2016, he remains our Board Chairman and is active with the Company. 

&#183; Products are differentiated and address significant unmet needs: Both of our lead product candidates, BTI-320 and IPOXYN, are well-differentiated diabetes-related formulations that address significant unmet medical needs. Diabetes management, including sugar management and treatment of inflammatory diseases, remains a critical area of unmet need. Increasingly, patients, physicians and the media are highlighting the deficiencies of current diabetes-related therapies and the growing population of affected individuals. 

&#183; A multiple product portfolio with a balanced risk reward profile: We have two lead product candidates and a dietary supplement product currently generating revenue with what we believe are significant growth prospects. We have also begun to develop a pipeline of additional carbohydrate-based therapeutics. Accordingly, we believe that the revenues we generate from our advanced products and drug candidates will offset costs related to developing our existing and future pipeline. 

&#183; Efficient development strategy: We believe that the FDA&#8217;s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for IPOXYN and its veterinary analog, OXYFEX, lowers the risk of drug development of these drug candidates. Our strategy of combining these drugs, once approved, with novel delivery methods and pharmaceutical compositions is expected to significantly reduce clinical development time and costs and lowers regulatory risks, while delivering valuable products in areas of high unmet need to the market place. 

Subsidiaries

We currently have no subsidiaries.

Employees

&#160;

The Company laid off its remaining employees on September 1, 2015, except for Dr. David Platt who remained in an unpaid position as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Platt resigned his positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer on March 16, 2016 and was replaced by Conroy Chi-Heng Cheng who is also a member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. Mr. Cheng is unpaid. No current employees have written employment agreement with the Company.

&#160;

Facilities

&#160;

We lease office space at 233 Needham Street, Newton MA 02464 under a 6 month lease that expires March 31, 2016. The lease was to automatically renew for an additional 6 months if not cancelled at least 60 days prior to its expiration. We agreed with the landlord to extend the lease for an additional 4 months through July 31, 2016. At that point, the lease will end with no further obligation. We also leased an office located at 1750 Elm Street, Suite 103, Manchester, NH 03104. The Company abandoned the Manchester NH lease in October of 2015 and did not make any payments under the lease since August 2015. In March 2016, the Company and the landlord agreed to settle the remaining lease obligation for a one-time payment of $152,000, which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company has no future obligation under the lease.

Manufacturing

&#160;

We currently contract with a third-party to manufacture BTI-320 and SUGARDOWN&#174; in the United States at a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliant facility. We are evaluating whether to gain access to a pilot-scale manufacturing facility with adequate capacity to produce &#160; IPOXYN for clinical trials and market introduction following FDA/European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) approval, but no agreement for such access is currently in place. We intend to only utilize manufacturing facilities that we believe are fully compliant with GMP as required by the regulatory authorities in Europe or the United States.

&#160;

Environmental Regulation

&#160;

Pharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies must comply with laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We do not anticipate building in-house research, development or manufacturing facilities, and, accordingly, do not expect to have to comply directly with environmental regulation. However, our contractors and others conducting research, development or manufacturing activities for us may be required to incur significant compliance cost, and this could in turn could increase our expense or delay our completion of research or manufacturing programs.

&#160;

Lack of Major Customers

To date we have had limited sales of our products and have one significant customer, Advance Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., a Hong Kong-based pharmaceutical company, a significant stockholder of ours, for distribution of SUGARDOWN &#174; in Hong Kong, China and Macau. These authorized territories were recently expanded to include Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia and Japan. One of our directors and interim CEO and CFO, Conroy Chi-Heng Cheng, is also a director of Advance Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. In May 2014, we entered into a strategic marketing agreement with Benchworks SD, LLC, a leading branding and marketing agency, aimed at driving brand awareness and growing sales of SUGARDOWN&#174; among the large pre-diabetic population in North America. There were no significant sales generated through the Benchworks agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015. This agreement was terminated in July 2015.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

Patents, trademarks, trade secrets, technological know-how and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our patent portfolio is directed to three main areas, mannans, hemoglobin composition and methods of use, and taste masking in chewable tablets. The active ingredient in BTI-320 is a mannan, and BTI-320 is a proprietary fractionated mannan. Mannans are a group of plant-derived complex carbohydrates, or polysaccharides, which consist mainly of polymers of the sugar mannose. Some of the plants from which mannans are derived are guar, locust bean, fenugreek, barley and konjac. Published studies on mannans have shown that they possess significant biological activity ranging from inhibition of cholesterol absorption to promoting wound healing and inhibiting tumor growth. Studies have also shown that consuming mannans before a meal may lessen the rise in blood glucose after the meal. Therefore, supplementation with mannans may be beneficial in the management of diabetes by supporting healthy blood sugar levels. We seek to strengthen our patent portfolio and increase market exclusivity as we progress in our clinical development process. During the clinical development and commercial scale up of our products, we anticipate additional intellectual property may be realized from the creation of novel therapeutic formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of use and novel quality control assays for each of our products. Our intellectual property estate directed to our technology and products consists of a provisional patent application and three international patent applications and their related national stage applications entitled: Composition of Purified Soluble Mannans for Dietary Supplements and Methods of Use Thereof (W02012/061675); Hemoglobin Compositions and Methods of Use (WO2012/78850); Encapsulation of Pharmaceuticals for Taste Masking in Chewable Tablets (PCT/US14/27243); and Compositions for Inhibiting Amylase Mediated Hydrolysis of Alpha (1-4) Linked Glucose Polymers (61/991,814).

The international patent application entitled Hemoglobin Compositions and Methods of Use and its related national stage filings, which were assigned to us by Dr. Platt, are directed to our IPOXYN and OXYFEX technologies.

&#160;

The international patent application entitled Composition of Purified Soluble Mannans for Dietary Supplements and Methods of Use Thereof and its related national stage filings, which were assigned to us by Dr. Platt, are directed to our BTI-320 and SUGARDOWN &#174; technologies.

&#160;

Dr. Platt also has assigned the trademarks IPOXYN (U.S. Trademark Application No. 77754473) and Avanyx Therapeutics&#8482; (U.S. Trademark Application No. 77806120) to us. Dr. Platt and our former President Mr. Tassey have assigned the trademark SUGARDOWN&#174; (U.S. Trademark Reg. No. 3,955,414, registered May 3, 2011) to us.

It is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products, product components, manufacturing processes or the intended uses for our products infringe the patent rights of others. It is likely that, from time to time, we will receive notices from others of claims or potential claims of intellectual property infringement or we may be called upon to defend a customer, vendee or licensee against such third-party claims. Responding to these kinds of claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable time, result in costly litigation or cause delays, all of which could harm our business.

&#160;

Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties claiming infringement. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.

Government Regulation

New drug approval for clinical use requires extensive research, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical studies, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, export and marketing, among other things. Both BTI-320 and IPOXYN will be subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. As a therapeutic product administered by intravenous infusion IPOXYN will be regulated as a drug and will require extensive safety and efficacy studies for regulatory approval before it may be commercialized.

&#160;

Drug Approval Process

&#160;

In the United States, IPOXYN is a new chemical entity and will require FDA approval. BTI-320, as a drug candidate, will also require FDA approval. Before final approval for marketing for either IPOXYN or BTI-320 could occur, the following steps must be completed: preclinical safety animal studies, GMP manufacturing, submission of Investigational New Drug, or IND application for extensive clinical trials to show proof of concept to significant health benefit.

&#160;

After approval and during clinical studies the FDA can put the drug on "clinical hold." In such case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the use of the drug can proceed. The FDA may stop marketing, or clinical trials, or particular types of trials, by imposing a clinical hold because of safety concerns and potential risk to patients.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational products to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator consistent with an informed consent. Each clinical protocol is submitted, reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or Ethical Committee (EC) at a participating hospital or clinical site, at which the study will be conducted. The IRB/EC will consider, among other things; ethical factors, safety to human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.

&#160;

Clinical trials required for FDA approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety or adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.

&#160;

Phase II clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

&#160;

Phase III clinical trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety within an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical sites.

&#160;

After FDA approval, Phase IV clinical trials may be conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase IV clinical trial requirement. These clinical trials are often referred to as Phase III/IV post-approval clinical trials.

&#160;

The results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the application requesting approval to market the product. The FDA may delay approval of any product submitted by the Company. The FDA may limit the indicated uses for which an approval is given.

New Drug Approval for Veterinary Use

&#160;

The use of new drugs for companion animals requires the filing of a New Animal Drug Application, or NADA, with and approval by the FDA. The requirements for approval are similar to those for new human drugs, exclusive of human trials. Obtaining NADA approval often requires safety and efficacy clinical field trials in the applicable species and disease, after submission of an Investigational New Animal Drug Application, or INADA, which for non-food animals becomes effective upon acceptance for filing.

Dietary Supplements

&#160;

We currently offer SUGARDOWN &#174; as a dietary supplement. We are not required to obtain FDA approval in order to offer SUGARDOWN &#174; in this manner. We are required to either comply with certain FDA guidelines with respect to certain marketing claims for SUGARDOWN &#174; , or to file those claims with the FDA. We believe that we comply with those guidelines and have voluntarily filed structural and functional claims with the FDA. 

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation

&#160;

Any FDA approvals that may be granted will be subject to continual review, and newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may result in withdrawal of products from marketing. Moreover, if and when such approval is obtained, the manufacture and marketing of our products remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements administered by the regulatory bodies, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, serious adverse event reporting requirements and the FDA's general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses.

&#160;

We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA for compliance with these regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory approvals and termination of marketing. Any such enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements, state and local work and environmental laws or the adoption of new requirements could also have a material adverse effect on us.

Foreign Regulation

&#160;

We will be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products in the United States and outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in any country.

&#160;

The approval process varies from country to country and can be complicated and time consuming; the time needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. For example, the European Union requires approval of a Marketing Authorization Application by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. These applications require the completion of extensive preclinical studies, clinical studies and manufacturing and controls information.

Reimbursement

&#160;

Our ability to successfully commercialize our human products also may depend on the extent to which reimbursement of the cost of such products and related treatment will be approved by the government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other health providers&#8217; organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. As third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products, there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement of the cost will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on its investment.

Recently the public and the federal government have focused significant attention on reforming the health care system in the United States. A number of health care reform measures have been suggested, including price controls on therapeutics. Public discussion of such measures is likely to continue, and concerns about the potential effects of different possible proposals have been reflected in the volatility of the stock prices of companies in the health care and related industries.
