 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 

Our Company 

Antero Resources Corporation (&#8220;Antero&#8221;) is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development, and acquisition of natural gas, NGLs, and oil properties located in the Appalachian Basin. We focus on unconventional reservoirs, which can generally be characterized as fractured shale formations. As of December 31, 2015 , we held approximatel y 569,000 net acres of oil and gas properties located in the Appalachian Basin in West Virginia, Ohio , and Pennsylvania. Our corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado. 

The following table provides a summary of selected data for our Appalachian Basin natural gas, NGLs, and oil assets as of the date and for the period indicated.

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for risks and uncertainties related to developing our potential well locations. 

Our management team has worked together for many years and has a successful track record of reserve and production growth as well as significant expertise in unconventional resource plays. Our strategy is to leverage our team&#8217;s experience delineating and developing natural gas resource plays to profitably grow our reserves and production, primarily on our existing multi &#8209;year project inventory. 

We have assembled a portfolio of long &#8209;lived properties that are characterized by what we believe to be low geologic risk and repeatability. Our drilling opportunities are focused in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale of the Appalachian Basin. From 2008 through December 31, 2015, our drilling operations in the Appalachian Basin have had a 100% success rate. We have approximately &#160; 3,719 potential horizontal well locations on our existing leasehold acreage, both proven and unproven. 

We have secured sufficient long &#8209;term firm takeaway capacity on major pipelines that are in existence or currently under construction in each of our core operating areas to accommodate our current development plans. 

&#160;

We operate in the following industry segments: (i) the exploration, development, and production of natural gas, NGLs, and oil, (ii) gathering and compression, (iii) water handling and treatment, and (iv) marketing of excess firm transportation capacity. All of our operations are conducted in the United States. Financial information for our industry segment operations is located under &#8220;Note 15: Segment Information.&#8221; 

2015 Developments and Highlights 

Energy Industry Environment 

In late 2014, global energy commodity prices declined precipitously as a result of several factors, including an increase in worldwide commodity supplies, a stronger U.S. dollar, relatively mild weather in large portions of the U.S. during winter months, and strong competition among oil producing countries for market share. These events continued into 2015 and early 2016 and, along with slower economic growth in China, have led to the further suppression of commodity prices. Spot prices for WTI declined from approximately $106.00 per Bbl in June 2014 to less than $50.00 per Bbl in January 2015, and declined further to less tha n $30.00 per Bbl in January 2016. Spot prices for Henry Hub natural gas declined from approximately $4.40 per MMBtu in January 2014 to $3.00 per MMBtu in January 2015, and declined further to less than $1.80 per MMBtu for a brief period in December 2015. Spot prices for propane, which is the largest source of our NGLs sales revenue, declined from approximately $1.55 per gallon in January 2014 to less than $0.50 per gallon in January 2015, and declined further to less than $0.35 per gallon in January 2016. 

In response to these market conditions and concerns about access to capital markets, many U.S. exploration and development companies significantly reduced their capital spending in 2015. Our capital spending for drilling, completions, and land for 2015 was $1.8 billion, a 44% reduction from our 2014 capital expenditures. In conjunction with the reduction in our capital expenditures during 2015, we deferred the completion of 50 wells. 

Our capital budget for drilling, completions, and land for 2016 is $1.4 billion (excluding the capital budget for our consolidated subsidiary, Antero Midstream LP, or &#8220;Antero Midstream&#8221;), a 24% reduction from our 2015 capital expenditures. We plan to operate an average of 7 drilling rigs in 2016 as compared to an average of 14 rigs in 2015, and we plan to complete 115 horizontal wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in 2016 as compared to 130 in 2015. We believe that our 2016 capital budget will be fully funded through operating cash flow and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or capital market transactions. We will continue to monitor commodity prices and may revise the capital budget if conditions warrant. Additionally, given the current commodity price environment, we have evaluated the carrying value of our proved properties. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; for a discussion of such evaluation. 

Reserves, Production, and Financial Results 

As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated proved reserves were 13.2 Tcfe, consisting of 9.5 Tcf of natural gas, 587 MMBbl of NGLs and 26 MMBbl of oil. As of December 31, 2015 , 72% of our estimated proved reserves by volume were natural gas, 27% were NGLs, and 1% was oil. Proved developed reserves were 5.8 Tcfe, or 44% of total proved reserves. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our production totaled 545 Bcfe, or 1,493 MMcfe per day, a 48% increase over 2014 levels. The average price received for 2015 production before the effects of gains on settled derivatives was $2.52 per Mcfe compared to $4.73 in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in energy commodity prices that began in 2014 and continued into 2015. The average realized price after the effects of gains on settled derivatives was $4.10 per Mcfe for 2015 as compared to $5.10 per Mcfe for 2014. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we generated cash flow from operations of $1.01 b illion, net income of $941 m illion, and Adjusted EBITDAX of $1.22 billion. Net income in 2015 included (i) gains on unsettled derivatives of $1.52 billion ( i i) a noncash charge of $ 98 million for equity-based compensation, (iii) a noncash charge of $104 million for impairments of unproved properties, &#160; and (i v ) a noncash tax expense of $576 million . See &#8220;Item 6. Selected Financial Data&#8221; for a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX (a non &#8209;GAAP measure) and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to net income (loss). 

Dropdown of Water Handling and Treatment Assets 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2015, we contributed (i) all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Antero Water LLC (&#8220;Antero Water&#8221;) to Antero Midstream and (ii) all of the assets, contracts, rights, permits and properties owned or leased by us and 

&#160;

used primarily in connection with the construction, ownership, operation, use or maintenance of our advanced wastewater treatment complex to be constructed in Doddridge County, West Virginia, to Antero Treatment LLC (&#8220;Antero Treatment&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antero Midstream (collectively, (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as the &#8220;Contributed Assets&#8221;) . 

&#160; 

In consideration for the Contributed Assets, Antero Midstream (i) paid us a cash distribution equal to $552.5 million, less $171 million of assumed debt, (ii) issued to us 10,988,421 common units representing limited partner interests in Antero Midstream, (iii) distributed to us proceeds of approximately $241 million from a private placement of Antero Midstream common units, and (iv) has agreed to pay us (a) $125 million in cash if Antero Midstream delivers 176,295,000 barrels or more of fresh water during the period between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019 and (b) an additional $125 million in cash if Antero Midstream delivers 219,200,000 barrels or more of fresh water during the period between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Antero Midstream borrowed $525 million on its bank credit facility in connection with this transaction. 

2015 Capital Spending and 2016 Capital Budget 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our total capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion, including drilling and completion costs of $1.7 billion, gathering and compression project costs by Antero Midstream of $360 million, water handling and treatment costs of $131 million (a portion of which were expenditures by Antero Midstream) , $199 million of leasehold costs, and other capital expenditures of $7 milli on. Our capital budget for drilling, completions, and land for 2016 is $ 1.4 billion , excluding the capital budget for Antero Midstream, and includes: $1.3 billion for drilling and completion and $100 million for core leasehold acreage acquisitions. We do not budget for acquisitions. Approximately 75% of the drilling and completion budget is allocated to the Marcellus Shale and the remaining 25% is allocated to the Utica Shale. During 2016, we plan to operate an average of 5 drilling rigs in the Marcellus Shale and 2 drilling rigs in the Utica Shale. Additionally, the capital budget for Antero Midstream for 2016 is approximately $435 million. We periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our budget and its allocation based on liquidity, drilling results, leasehold acquisition opportunities, and commodity prices. 

Hedge Position 

At December 31, 2015 , we had entered into fixed price hedging contracts for January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2022 for 3 . 365 Tcf of our projected natural gas production at a weighted average index price of $3.80 per MMBtu and 1.036 billion gallons of propane at a weighted average price of $0.51 per gallon. These hedging contracts include contracts for the year ending December 31, 2016 of 590.2 Bcf of natural gas at a weighted average index price of $3.92 per MMBtu and 461.2 million gallons of propane at a weighted average price of $0.59 per gallon. We believe this hedge position provides protection to cash flows supporting our future operations and capital spending plans for 2016 through 2022. As of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts was approximately $3.1 billion. 

Credit Facilities 

The current borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is $4. 5 billion and lender commitments are $ 4 .0 billion. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is redetermined semi &#8209;annually and is based on the estimated future cash flows from our proved reserves and our commodity hedge positions. The next redetermination is scheduled to occur in April 2016 . At December 31, 2015 , we had $ 707 million of borrowings and $ 702 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility matures in May 2019. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Debt Agreements and Contractual Obligations&#8212;Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility&#8221; for a description of our revolving credit facility. 

Our consolidated subsidiary, Antero Midstream, has a revolving credit facility agreement that provides for lender commitments of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2015, Antero Midstream had $620 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The facility will mature in November 2019. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Debt Agreements and Contractual Obligations&#8212;Midstream Credit Facility&#8221; for a description of this revolving credit facility. 

Issuance of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2022 

&#160; 

On March 17, 2015, we issued $750 million of 5.625% senior notes due June 1, 2023 at par. The proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 

&#160; 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had four series of senior notes outstanding totaling $3.375 billion in aggregate principal amount. The notes bear interest at rates ranging from 5.125% to 6.00% and have maturity dates ranging from December 1, 2020 to June 1, 2023. 

&#160; 

Issuance of Common Stock 

&#160; 

On March 10, 2015, we completed an offering of 13,100,000 shares of our common stock. In connection with the offering, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase a maximum of 1,900,000 additional shares of our common stock at the offering price. On March 31, 2015, the underwriter exercised its option and purchased 1,600,000 shares. After deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses related to the offering, we received total net proceeds of approximately $538 million. The proceeds from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Our Properties and Operations 

Estimated Proved Reserves 

The information with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Reserves Presentation 

The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves, related standardized measure, and PV &#8209;10 at December 31, 2013 , 2014 and 2015 . Our estimated proved reserves are based on evaluations prepared by our internal reserve engineers, which have been audited by our independent engineers, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (&#8220;D&#38;M&#8221;). We refer to D&#38;M as our independent engineers. A copy of the summary report of D&#38;M with respect to our reserves at December 31, 2015 is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. Within D&#38;M, the technical person primarily responsible for reviewing our reserves estimates was Gregory K. Graves, P.E. Mr. Graves is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 70734), is a member of both the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, and has in excess of 31 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. Mr. Graves graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Reserves at December 31, 2013 and 2014 were prepared assuming ethane rejection. Reserves at December 31, 2015 were prepared assuming recovery of approximately 11,500 gross barrels of ethane per day, and rejection of the remaining ethane. When ethane is rejected at the processing plant, it is left in the gas stream and sold with the methane gas.

Pre-tax PV &#8209;10 was prepared using average yearly prices computed using SEC rules, discounted at 10% per annum, without giving effect to taxes. Pre-tax PV &#8209;10 is a non &#8209;GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of pre-tax PV &#8209;10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of future net cash flows, or after tax amount, 

&#160;

because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, pre-tax PV &#8209;10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, pre-tax PV &#8209;10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the pre-tax PV &#8209;10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. For more information about the calculation of standardized measure, see footnote 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. 

The following sets forth the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves (without giving effect to our commodity hedges), the present value of those net cash flows before income tax (PV &#8209;10), the present value of those net cash flows after income tax (s tandardized measure) and the prices used in projecting future net cash flows at December 31, 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 :

12 &#8209;month average prices used at December 31, 2013 were $3.65 per MMBtu for natural gas, $47.13 per Bbl for NGLs, and $87.00 per Bbl for oil for the Appalachian Basin based on a $97.17 WTI reference price. 

(2) 

12 &#8209;month average prices used at December 31, 2014 were $4.07 per MMBtu for natural gas, $45.89 per Bbl for NGLs, and $81.48 per Bbl for oil for the Appalachian Basin based on a $94.42 WTI reference price. 

(3) 

12 &#8209;month average prices used at December 31, 2015 were $2.56 per MMBtu for natural gas, $14.19 per Bbl for NGLs, and $40.06 per Bbl for oil for the Appalachian Basin based on a $50.13 WTI reference price. 

Future net cash flows represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Prices for 2013 , 2014 and 2015 were based on 12 &#8209;month unweighted average of the first &#8209;day &#8209;of &#8209;the &#8209;month pricing, without escalation. Costs are based on costs in effect for the applicable year without escalation. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced as estimated or that the prices and costs will remain constant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information, and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. 

Changes in Proved Reserves During 2015

Proved reserves, December 31, 2015 

13,215 

&#160; 

Extensions, discoveries, and other additions of 2,878 Bcfe resulted from delineation and development drilling in both the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Upward revisions of 1,091 Bcfe due to partial ethane recovery is a result of changing from ethane rejection at December 31, 2014 to partial ethane recovery in 2015. In 2015, we began ethane recovery and changed our underlying production assumptions to the recovery of approximately 11,500 gross barrels per day of ethane at December 31, 2015. Negative performance revisions of 358 Bcfe resulted from the revised statistical analysis of reserves based on actual production results. Negative revisions of 2,332 Bcfe were due to the SEC 5-year development rule because we no longer expect certain locations in the eastern portion of our Marcellus acreage containing primarily dry gas to be developed within five years. Negative revisions of 202 

&#160;

Bcfe were due to the decreases in prices for natural gas, NGLs, and oil. Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 totaled approximately 13.2 Tcfe and increased by 4% over the prior year . 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

Proved undeveloped reserves are included in the previous table of total proved reserves. The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2015 (in Bcfe):

Proved undeveloped reserves, December 31, 2015 

7,377 

Extensions, discoveries, and other additions during 2015 of 2,355 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves resulted from delineation and developmental drilling in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Development drilling resulted in the reclassification of 986 Bcfe to proved developed reserves. Negative performance revisions of 445 Bcfe resulted from lower estimated ultimate recoveries from certain undeveloped wells. Negative revisions of 2,332 Bcfe were due to the SEC 5-year development rule because we no longer expect certain locations in the eastern portion of the Marcellus acreage containing primarily dry gas to be developed within five years. Negative revisions of 95 Bcfe were due to decreases in the prices for natural gas, NGLs, and oil. Proved undeveloped reserves include reserves that are expected to be drilled and developed within five years; wells that are not drilled within five years from booking are reclassified from proved reserves to probable reserves. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we converted approximately 986 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves at a total capital cost of approximately &#160; $ 577 million . Estimated future development costs relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 are approximately $5.1 billion over the next five years, which we expect to finance through cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other sources of capital financing. Our drilling programs to date have focused on proving our unproved leasehold acreage through delineation drilling. While we will continue to drill leasehold delineation wells and build on our current leasehold position, we will also continue drilling our proved undeveloped reserves. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed over the next five years. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.&#8221; 

Preparation of Reserve Estimates 

Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 included in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K were prepared by our internal reserve engineers in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation standards published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. Our internally prepared reserve estimates were audited by our independent reserve engineers. Our independent reserve engineers were selected for their historical experience and geographic expertise in engineering unconventional resources. The technical persons responsible for overseeing the audit of our reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 

Our internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to our independent reserve engineers in their reserve auditing process. Periodically, our technical team meets with the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used by us to prepare reserve estimates. Our internally prepared reserve estimates and related reports are reviewed and approved by our Senior Vice President of Reserves, Planning &#38; Midstream, Ward D. McNeilly. Mr. McNeilly has been with the Company since October 2010. Mr. McNeilly has 35 years of experience in oil and gas operations, reservoir management, and strategic planning. From 2007 to October 2010, Mr. McNeilly was the Operations Manager for BHP Billiton&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico operations. From 1996 through 2007, Mr. McNeilly served in various North Sea and Gulf of Mexico Deepwater operations and asset management positions with Amoco and then BP. From 1979 through 1996, Mr. McNeilly served in various domestic and 

&#160;

international operations and reservoir and asset management positions with Amoco. Mr. McNeilly holds a B.S. in Geological Engineering from the Mackay School of Mines at the University of Nevada. 

Our senior management also reviews our reserve estimates and related reports with Mr. McNeilly and other members of our technical staff. Additionally, our senior management reviews and approves any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. 

Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, we and the independent reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, micro &#8209;seismic data, and well &#8209;test data. Probable reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves which may potentially be recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques are, by nature, more uncertain than estimates of proved reserves and, accordingly, are subject to substantially greater risk of realization. Possible reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes, and other factors. 

Methodology Used to Apply Reserve Definitions 

In the Marcellus Shale, our estimated reserves are based on information from our large, operated proved developed producing reserve base, as well as information from other operators in the area, which can be used to confirm or supplement our internal estimates. Typically, proved undeveloped properties are booked based on applying the estimated lateral length to the average Bcf per 1,000 feet from our proved developed producing wells. 

We may attribute up to 11 proved undeveloped locations based on one proved developed producing well where analysis of geologic and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable. However, the ratio of proved undeveloped locations generated will be lower when multiple proved developed wells are drilled on a single pad. In addition, we have applied the concept of a statistical proven area to certain areas of our Marcellus Shale acreage whereby undeveloped properties are booked as proved reserves so long as well count is sufficient for statistical analysis and certain land, geologic, engineering and commercial criteria are met. 

Although our operating history in the Utica Shale is more limited than our Marcellus Shale operations, we expect to be able to apply a similar methodology once the well count is sufficient for statistical analysis. The primary differences between the two areas are that (i) we have not established a statistical proven area in the Utica Shale and (ii) each proved developed producing well in the Utica Shale only generates four direct offset well locations in the Utica Shale due to less relative maturity. 

Identification of Potential Well Locations 

Our identified potential well locations include locations to which proved, probable or possible reserves were attributable based on SEC pricing as of December 31, 2015 . We prepare internal estimates of probable and possible reserves but have not included disclosure of such reserves in this report. 

Production, Revenues, and Price History 

Because natural gas, NGLs, and oil are commodities, the price that we receive for our production is largely a function of market supply and demand. While demand for natural gas in the United States has increased materially since 2000, natural gas and NGLs supplies have also increased significantly as a result of horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation technologies which have been used to find and recover large amounts of oil and gas from various shale formations throughout the United States. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, weather, and other seasonal conditions. Over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. The significant commodity price declines in late 2014 through 2015 and into 2016 are the most recent example of such volatility. A 

&#160;

substantial or extended decline in gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of reserves that may be economically produced, and our ability to access capital markets. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Natural gas, NGLs, and oil prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.&#8221;

Productive Wells 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 708 gross (666 net) producing wells, averaging a 94% working interest, in the Marcellus Shale. This well count includes 437 gross (426 net) horizontal wells, and 271 gross (239 net) vertical wells that were primarily acquired in conjunction with leasehold acreage acquisitions. In the Utica Shale, we had 111 gross (95 net) producing horizontal wells at December 31, 2015 , averaging an 85% working interest. Our wells are gas wells, many of whi ch also produce oil, condensate, and NGLs. Additionally, at December 31, 2015 we had 118 gross horizontal wells ( 115 net) waiting on completion or in the process of being completed. 

Acreage 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the total developed and undeveloped acreage in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2015 . A majority of our developed acreage is subject to liens securing our revolving credit facility. 

&#160;

Approximately 52% of our Marcellus acreage and 28% of our Utica acreage is held by production. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty, and other similar interests is excluded from this table.

Delivery Commitments 

We have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell gas. We believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of such commitments, but may be required to purchase gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 , our firm sales commitments through 2020 included: 

&#160; 

Year Ending December 31,

As provided in the table above, we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver gas and NGLs under the majority of these firm sales contracts. We have firm transportation contracts that require us to deliver products to pipeline transporters or pay demand charges for shortfalls. The minimum demand fees are reflected in our table of contractual obligations. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Debt Agreements and Contractual Obligations.&#8221; If our production quantities are insufficient to meet such commitments, we may purchase third party products or market our excess firm transportation capacity to third parties. 

Gathering and Compression 

Our exploration and development activities are supported by the natural gas gathering and compression assets of our subsidiary, Antero Midstream, as well as by third &#8209;party gathering, compression, processing, and transportation arrangements. Unlike many producing basins in the United States, certain portions of the Appalachian Basin do not have sufficient midstream infrastructure to support the existing and expected increasing levels of production. Our relationship with Antero Midstream allows us to obtain the necessary gathering and compression capacity for our production . 

Prior to Antero Midstream&#8217;s initial public offering in November 2014 (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;), we committed to developing the necessary midstream infrastructure to support our drilling schedule and production growth. We accomplished this goal through a combination of internal asset developments and contractual relationships with third &#8209;party midstream service providers. 

As part of our internal developments, we invested a significant amount of capital in building low &#8209; and high &#8209;pressure gathering lines, and compressor stations. Since its IPO in November 2014, we have leveraged our relationship with Antero Midstream to support our growth. In 2015, Antero Midstream spent approximately $320 million on midstream gas and condensate gathering and compression infrastructure that services our production. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Antero Midstream, owned and operated 182 miles of gas gathering pipelines in the Marcellus Shale. We also have access to additional low &#8209;pressure and high &#8209;pressure pipelines owned and operated by Crestwood, Energy Transfer Partners L.P., and Summit Midstream. As of December 31, 2015 , Anter o Midstream owned and operated 8 compressor stations and we utilized 14 additional third &#8209;party compressor stations in the Marcellus Shale. The gathering, compression and dehydration services provided by third parties are contracted on a fixed &#8209;fee basis. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Antero Midstream owned and operated 110 miles of low &#8209;pressure, high &#8209;pressure , and condensate pipelines in the Utica Shale, and Antero owned and operated 8 miles of high-pressure pipelines. As of December 31, 2015 , Antero Midstream owned and operated 1 compressor station and we utilized 5 third &#8209;party compressor stations in the Utica Shale. 

Pursuant to our gathering and compression services agreement with Antero Midstream entered into in 2014, we dedicated substantially all of our current and future acreage for gathering and compression services for 20 years. All of our existing acreage is dedicated to Antero Midstream for gathering and compression services except for acreage attributable to third party commitments in effect prior to the Antero Midstream IPO, which includes 136,000 Marcellus Shale net leasehold acres characterized by dry gas and liquids rich reserves that have been previously dedicated to third party gatherers. In addition to our existing acreage dedication, the agreement provides that any acreage we acquire in the future will be dedicated to Antero Midstream for gathering and compression services unless such acreage is subject to a pre-existing dedication for such services. Antero Midstream also provides condensate gathering services to us under the gathering and compression agreement. 

&#160;

Natural Gas Processing 

Many of our wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shales allow us to produce liquids rich natural gas that contains a significant amount of NGLs. Natural gas containing significant amounts of NGLs must be processed, which involves the removal and separation of NGLs from the wellhead natural gas. 

NGLs are valuable commodities once removed from the natural gas stream and fractionated into their key components. Fractionation refers to the process by which a NGLs stream is separated into individual NGLs products such as ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline. Fractionation occurs by heating the mixed NGL stream to allow for the separation of the component parts based on the specific boiling points of each product. Each of the individual products have their own market price. 

The combination of infrastructure constraints in the Appalachian region and low ethane prices has resulted in many producers &#8220;rejecting&#8221; rather than &#8220;recovering&#8221; ethane. Ethane rejection occurs when ethane is left in the wellhead gas stream when the gas is processed, rather than being separated out and sold as a liquid after fractionation. When ethane is left in the gas stream, the Btu content of the residue gas at the tailgate of the processing plant is higher. Producers will elect to &#8220;reject&#8221; ethane when the price received for the ethane in the gas stream is greater than the net price received for the ethane being sold as a liquid after fractionation. When ethane is recovered, the Btu content of the residue gas is lower, but a producer is then able to recover the value of the ethane sold as a separate product. 

Given the existing commodity price environment and the current limited ethane market in the northeast, we are currently rejecting most of the ethane when processing our liquids &#8209;rich gas. However, we realize a pricing upgrade when selling the remaining NGL products stream at current prices. We may elect to recover more ethane when ethane prices result in a value for the ethane that is greater than the Btu equivalent residue gas and incremental recovery costs. In December 2015, we began recovering some ethane as the first de-ethanizer was placed on line at the Sherwood gas processing facility, and our first international ethane sales contract is expected to commence in 2017. 

Through third &#8209;party contractual relationships, we have obtained committed cryogenic processing capacity for our Marcellus and Utica Shale production. We have contracted with MarkWest Energy Partners L.P. to provide processing capacity as follows:

Transportation and Takeaway Capacity 

Our primary firm transportation commitments include the following: 

&#183; 

We have entered into firm transportation agreements with various pipelines that enable us to deliver natural gas to the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Eastern Regional, and Mid-Atlantic markets. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have several firm transportation contracts with pipelines that have capacity to deliver natural gas to the Chicago and 

&#160;

Michigan markets. The Chicago directed pipelines include the Rockies Express Pipeline (&#8220;REX&#8221;), the Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline (&#8220;MGT&#8221;), the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America pipeline (&#8220;NGPL&#8221;), and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline (&#8220;ANR&#8221;). 

&#160; 

o 

The firm transportation contract on REX provides firm capacity for 600,000 MMBtu per day and will deliver gas to downstream contracts on MGT, NGPL, and ANR. We have 165,000 MMBtu per day of firm transportation on MGT which will increase by an additional 125,000 MMBtu per day in March 2016. We have 235,000 MMBtu per day of firm transportation on NGPL which will increase by an additional 75,000 MMBtu per day in November 2016. Both of these contracts will deliver gas to the Chicago city gate area.In addition, we have 200,000 MMBtu per day of firm transportation on ANR-Chicago to deliver natural gas to Chicago in the summer and Michigan in the winter. The contracts expire at various dates from 2021 through 2034. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

To access the Gulf Coast market and Eastern Regional markets, we have firm transportation contracts with various pipelines. These contracts include firm capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline (&#8220;TCO&#8221;), Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline (&#8220;Columbia Gulf&#8221;), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company pipeline (&#8220;Tennessee&#8221;), ANR Pipeline Company pipeline (&#8220;ANR-Gulf&#8221;), Equitrans pipeline (&#8220;EQT&#8221;), and the M3 Appalachian Gathering System (&#8220;M3&#8221;). This diverse portfolio of firm capacity gives us the flexibility to move natural gas to the local Appalachia market or other preferred markets, thereby allowing the company to diversify its exposure to indices with less favorable pricing. 

&#160; 

o 

We have several firm transportation contracts on TCO for volumes that total to approximately 582,000 MMBtu per day. Of the 582,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on TCO, we have the ability to utilize 530,000 MMbtu per day of firm capacity on Columbia Gulf, which provides access to the Gulf Coast markets. These contracts expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025. 

&#160; 

o 

We have a firm transportation contract with Stonewall Gas Gathering for 1,100,000 MMBtu per day which will transport gas from various gathering system interconnection points and the MarkWest Sherwood Plant complex to the TCO WB System. We have a firm transportation contract with TCO to transport natural gas in the western and eastern direction on TCO&#8217;s WB system. The firm transportation contract on TCO&#8217;s WB system provides firm capacity in the western direction for volumes that increase from 590,000 MMBtu per day to 790,000 MMBtu per day in June 2018. This west directed firm capacity provides access to the local Appalachia market and the Gulf Coast market via the Columbia Gulf or Tennessee pipelines. The firm transportation contract on TCO&#8217;s WB system also provides firm capacity in the eastern direction, which delivers natural gas to the Cove Point LNG facility, for 330,000 MMBtu per day beginning in June 2018. These contracts expire at various dates from 2030 through 2037. 

&#160; 

o 

We have a firm transportation contract for 600,000 MMBtu per day on ANR-Gulf to deliver natural gas from Ohio to the Gulf Coast market. This contract expires in 2045. 

&#160; 

o 

We have a firm transportation contract for 800,000 MMBtu per day, estimated to be in-service in mid 2017, on the Energy Transfer Rover Pipeline which will connect the Marcellus and Utica Shale assets to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets, or for export to Canadian markets, via our existing firm transportation on ANR Chicago and ANR Gulf. This contract expires in 2033. 

&#160;

We have firm transportation contracts for 250,000 MMBtu per day on EQT to deliver Marcellus natural gas to other various delivery points. The contracts expire at various dates from 2021 through 2025. 

&#160; 

o 

We have firm transportation contracts for 375,000 MMBtu per day on the M3 Appalachian Gathering System to deliver Marcellus natural gas to TETCO M2 and other various local delivery points. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a firm transportation contract for 20,000 Bbl per day on the Enterprise Products Partners ATEX pipeline (&#8220;ATEX&#8221;), to take ethane from Appalachia to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The ATEX firm transportation commitment expires in 2028. 

&#183; 

We have a firm transportation contract for 11,500 Bbl per day on the Sunoco pipeline (or &#8220;Mariner East 2&#8221;) to take ethane from Houston, Pennsylvania to Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. We also have a firm transportation contract on Mariner East 2 to take 50,000 Bbl per day of propane or butane from Hopedale, Ohio to Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. 

&#160;

The expected in-service date of Mariner East 2 is early 2017. These contracts expire on the tenth anniversary from the in-service date. The Mariner East 2 provides access to international markets via trans-ocean cargo carriers. 

Under firm transportation contracts, we are obligated to deliver minimum daily volumes or pay fees for any deficiencies in deliveries. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Debt Agreements and Contractual Obligations&#8221; for information on our minimum fees for such contracts. Based on current projected 2016 annual production levels, we estimate that we could incur total annual net marketing costs of $95 million to $125 million in 2016 for unutilized transportation capacity depending on the amount of unutilized capacity that can be marketed to third parties or utilized to transport third party gas and capture positive basis differentials. Where permitted, we continue to actively market any excess capacity in order to offset minimum commitment fees. 

Water Handling and Treatment Operations 

On September 23, 2015, we contributed (i) all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Antero Water to Antero Midstream and (ii) all of the assets, contracts, rights, permits and properties owned or leased by us and used primarily in connection with the construction, ownership, operation, use or maintenance of our advanced wastewater treatment complex to be constructed in Doddridge County, West Virginia, to Antero Treatment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antero Midstream . Our relationship with Antero Midstream allows us to obtain the necessary fresh and recycled water for use in our drilling and completion operations, as well as services to dispose of waste water resulting from our operations. 

Antero Midstream owns two independent fresh water distribution systems that distribute fresh water from the Ohio River and several regional water sources for well completion operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. These systems consist of permanent buried pipelines, movable surface pipelines and fresh water storage facilitates, as well as pumping stations to transport the fresh water throughout the pipeline networks. To the extent necessary, the surface pipelines are moved to well pads for service completion operations in concert with our drilling program. As of December 31, 2015 , Antero Midstream had the a bility to store a total of 4.9 mil lion barrels of fresh water in 35 impoundments. 

Due to the extensive geographic distribution of Antero Midstream&#8217;s water pipeline systems in both West Virginia and Ohio, it has provided water delivery services to neighboring oil and gas producers within and adjacent to our operating area, and is able to provide water delivery services to other oil and gas producers in the area, subject to commercial arrangements, in an effort to further reduce water truck traffic. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Antero M idstream owned and operated 104 miles of buried fresh water pipelines and 80 miles of movable surface fresh water pipelines in the Marcellus Shale, as well as 22 centralized water storage facilities equipped with transfer pumps. As of December 31, 2015 , Antero Midstream owned and operated 49 miles of buried fresh water pipelines and 26 miles of movable surface fresh water pipelines in the Utica Shale, as well as 13 centralized water storage facilities equipped with transfer pumps. 

In August 2015 , we committed to developing an advanced wastewater treatment complex in Doddridge County, West Virginia. The complex was transferred to Antero Midstream in conjunction with the sale of our water handling systems. The wastewater treatment complex, once completed, will include a 60,000 barrel per day facility that will allow Antero Midstream to treat our flowback and produced water for subsequent use or sale for well completions. The treatment facility is expected to be in service near the end of 2017. Late in 2015, Antero Midstream began providing us with waste water services for our well completion operations, including waste water transportation, disposal, and treatment. 

Major Customers 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , three of our customers accounted for approximately 19%, 18%, and 13% of our total product revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, three of our customers accounted for 29%, 16%, and 12% of our total product revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, two of our customers accounted for 30% and 14% or our total product revenues, respectively. &#160; &#160; Although a substantial portion of our production is purchased by these major customers, we do not believe the loss of any one or several customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, as we believe other customers or markets would be accessible to us. 

&#160;

Title to Properties 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, often in the case of undeveloped properties, cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use, or affect the value of, the properties. Burdens on properties may include: 

&#183; 

customary royalty interests; 

&#183; 

liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes; 

&#183; 

obligations or duties under applicable laws; 

&#183; 

development obligations under natural gas leases; or 

&#183; 

net profits interests. 

Seasonality 

Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. Cold winters can significantly increase demand and price fluctuations. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also reduce seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations. 

Competition 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies in our industry that have greater resources than we do. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce natural gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit, and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing natural gas properties. 

Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

General 

Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, laws and regulations related to the production, transportation and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. We believe compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industries are regularly considered by Congress, federal agencies, the states, local governments, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers, and marketers with which we compete. 

&#160;

Regulation of Production of Natural Gas and Oil 

We own interests in properties located onshore in three U.S. states, and our production activities on these properties are subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. These statutes and regulations address requirements related to permits for drilling of wells, bonding to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, the plugging and abandonment of wells, venting or flaring of natural gas, and the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. In addition, all of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing environmental and conservation matters, including provisions for the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from natural gas and oil wells, and the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled. Some states also have the power to prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing or density. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and NGLs within its jurisdiction. 

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 

Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas 

The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or NGPA, and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non &#8209;discriminatory basis. Although FERC&#8217;s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. 

Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline&#8217;s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. The distinction between FERC &#8209;regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case &#8209;by &#8209;case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory &#8209;take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. 

Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. 

Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas, NGLs, and Oil 

The prices at which we sell natural gas, NGLs, and oil is not currently subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. FERC, however, regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to 

&#160;

market. FERC regulates the transportation of oil and liquids on interstate pipelines under the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and regulations issued under those statutes. Intrastate transportation of oil, NGLs, and other products, is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. In addition, while sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate, and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

With regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC as described below, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties as well as related third party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 

The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti &#8209;market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provided FERC with additional civil penalty authority. In Order No. 670, FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti &#8209;market manipulation provision of the EPAct of 2005, which make it unlawful to: (1) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti &#8209;market manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non &#8209;jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non &#8209;jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704 described below. Under the EPAct of 2005, FERC has the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation of the NGA and the NGPA. 

Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers and natural gas producers are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC&#8217;s policy statement on price reporting. 

The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity. In November 2009, the FTC issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per violation per day. Together with FERC, these agencies have imposed broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets and energy futures markets. 

Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. 

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local statutes and regulations governing occupational safety and health and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Violations of these laws can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activity commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas, require some form of remedial 

&#160;

action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 

Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In addition, despite the &#8220;petroleum exclusion&#8221; of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas, we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances based on their characteristics; however, we are unaware of any liabilities arising under CERCLA for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us. 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws, establish detailed requirements for the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. RCRA specifically excludes drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, or state agencies under RCRA&#8217;s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions, or under state laws or other federal laws. Moreover, it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils that may become regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics. Although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant, we do not believe that our costs in this regard are materially more burdensome than those for similarly situated companies. 

We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off &#8209; site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act or have acted as operator. The failure of a prior owner or operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us as current owners or operators under CERCLA. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, regardless of fault, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (the &#8220;CWA&#8221;), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a 

&#160;

permit issued by the EPA or a state equivalent agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA&#8217;s and the Corps&#8217; jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA&#8217;s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. Also, pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as &#8220;SPCC plans,&#8221; in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre &#8209;approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants, the costs of which could be significant. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. The EPA has also issued final rules under the Clean Air Act that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP, programs. These final rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound, or VOC, emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as &#8220;green completions.&#8221; These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Regulation of &#8220;Greenhouse Gas&#8221; Emissions 

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case &#8209;by &#8209;case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. These changes to EPA&#8217;s GHG emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule. 

In August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, known as NSPS Quad Oa. The EPA&#8217;s proposed rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well 

&#160;

completions. In addition, the rule package would extend existing VOC standards under the EPA&#8217;s Subpart OOOO of the NSPS, or NSPS Quad O, to include previously unregulated equipment within the oil and natural gas source category. More recently, in January 2016, Pennsylvania announced new rules that will require the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, or PADEP, to develop a new general permit for oil and gas exploration, development, and production facilities and liquids loading activities, requiring best available technology for equipment and processes, enhanced record-keeping, and quarterly monitoring inspections for the control of methane emissions. The PADEP also intends to issue similar methane rules for existing sources. In addition, the department has also proposed to establish Best Management Practices, including leak detection and repair, or LDAR, programs, to reduce fugitive methane emissions from production, gathering, processing, and transmission facilities. These rules have the potential to increase our compliance costs. 

We have been making efforts to reduce methane emissions since March 2005, when we engaged local community groups in Colorado regarding its activities in the Piceance Basin in discussions on how to minimize impacts from its operations. As noted above, in 2012, the EPA promulgated NSPS Quad O, which, among other actions, requires the use of reduced emission completions, or &#8220;green completions,&#8221; to control emissions of VOCs from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Green completions have the added benefit of reducing methane emissions from our operations. The green completions requirements of NSPS Quad O became effective in January 2015, but we have been performing green completions since before the EPA&#8217;s rules became effective. We were one of the first operators to implement green completions in Colorado back in July 2011, using equipment that our personnel helped design. After initial testing confirming the viability and effectiveness of the units, we implemented their use in the Appalachian Basin Marcellus shale play in 2012 and later in the Utica shale play. We believe we have a long history of managing methane emissions from our operations, as demonstrated by our longstanding use of green completions. 

When we permit a facility, we are required to install pollution control equipment at the wellsite in accordance with the requirements of the NSPS for New Stationary Sources. At wellpads, this consists of installing combustors with a control efficiency of 98% to control tank methane and VOC emissions. In addition to combustors, we also install Vapor Recovery Units, or VRUs, in order to capture methane and VOC emissions and direct them down the sales line, rather than flaring those emissions. Per applicable regulations, we also install low-bleed pneumatic controls at wellpads, which serve to reduce methane emissions. We may also install Vapor Recovery Towers, or VRTs, to further reduce methane and VOC flashing emissions from storage tanks when we have more than a nominal amount of oil production in order to produce sufficient gas to allow safe and proper running of the VRTs. At compressor stations, through the use of non-selective catalytic reduction, we reduce methane and VOC emissions from engines by at least 70%. Compressor Station tank and dehydration units are typically controlled by combustors or VRUs. We control our methane and VOC emissions consistent with available emission control technology as required by law and as applicable to our operations. 

Our methane and VOC control program consists of installing the emission controls described above, performing inspections, and conducting preventative maintenance and repairs to minimize emissions leakage. For example, we have implemented an LDAR program for our well pad and compressor station operations. During 2015, we added two fulltime staff members to manage the LDAR program. LDAR program inspections utilize a state of the art Forward Looking Infrared camera to identify equipment leaks. Our Operations group has a maintenance program in place, which includes cleaning, greasing and replacing thief hatch seals, and other measures as required to further minimize the potential for leaks, In 2015, we implemented new thief hatch designs with improved seals for our tanks. While the LDAR program is not mandatory in all areas of our operations, we have implemented it uniformly across all of our activities. We believe that our efforts to date have resulted in a declining volume of methane emissions based on the decreasing number of leaks detected as part of our LDAR program. In addition, since 2011 and in accordance with EPA regulations, we have monitored or calculated our GHG emissions, including emissions of methane, and reported them to the EPA on an annual basis. Our current report of GHG emissions from covered operations during 2015 will be submitted to the EPA by March 31, 2016. Overall, through the use of Green Completions we have seen significant decreases in GHG emissions from our operations. Furthermore, we believe that our efforts to comply with the 2012 NSPS Quad O have resulted in us being well positioned to comply with the EPA&#8217;s recently proposed NSPS Quad Oa regulations to reduce methane and VOC emissions from oil and natural gas operations. However, additional compliance measures and expenditures will most likely be required to comply with EPA&#8217;s proposal, if finalized. 

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs 

&#160;

to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Severe limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. 

Hydraulic Fracturing Activities 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure through a cased and cemented wellbore into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations, as does most of the domestic oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 regarding such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA proposed rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; however, to date, no further action has been taken on the proposal. The EPA also proposed in April 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. 

In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in January 2016, the PADEP issued new rules establishing stricter disposal requirements for wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing activities, which include, among other things, a prohibition on the use of centralized impoundments for the storage of drill cuttings and waste fluids. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 

Certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration &#8209;wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a final rule in March 2015 that would implement updated requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule pending a final decision on whether it may be implemented. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. 

Occupational Safety and Health Act 

We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. 

&#160;

Endangered Species Act 

The federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, provides for the protection of endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species&#8217; habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on natural gas and oil leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or the USFWS, may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas for natural gas and oil development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement, the USFWS is required to make a determination as to whether more than 250 species as endangered or threatened should be listed under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. For example, in April 2015, the USFWS listed the northern long-eared bat, whose habitat includes the areas in which we operate, as a threatened species under the ESA. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases. 

Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non &#8209;recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2015, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2016. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 480 full &#8209;time employees, including 57 in executive, finance , treasury and administration, 22 in geology, 1 86 in production and engineering, 9 0 in midstre am, 76 in land, and 49 in accounting. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain , and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
