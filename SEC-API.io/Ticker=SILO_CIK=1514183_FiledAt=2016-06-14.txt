 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Corporate Background 

&#160; 

Point Capital, Inc. was incorporated under its original name Gold Swap Inc. under the laws of the State of New York on July 13, 2010. On December 11, 2012, shareholders holding 25,519,700 (representing 83.3%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock executed and delivered to the Company their written consent to change the Company&#8217;s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware by the merger of Gold Swap with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Point Capital, Inc., and to change the name of the Company from &#8220;Gold Swap Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Point Capital, Inc.&#8221; The Definitive Information Statement pursuant to Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was mailed to shareholders on or about December 31, 2012. The merger was effective on January 24, 2013. 

&#160; 

We are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. For 2015 and 2014, we are treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;).

&#160; 

Investment Objective 

&#160; 

Our investment objective is to provide current income and capital appreciation. We intend to accomplish our objective by investing in the common stock, preferred stock, warrants and convertible notes of small and mid-cap companies. Our investments are made principally through direct investments in prospective portfolio companies. However, we may also purchase securities in private secondary transactions. The Company will also consider investing in private companies that meet its investment objectives. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

A large number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we target as part of our business strategy. We compete for such investments with a large number of venture capital funds, other equity and non-equity based investment funds, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may require less information than we do and/or have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company and, as a result, such companies may be more successful in completing their investments. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. 

&#160; 

Governance 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors monitors and performs an oversight role with respect to our business and affairs, including with respect to investment practices and performance, compliance with regulatory requirements and the services, expenses and performance of our service providers. Among other things, our Board of Directors approves the appointment of our officers, reviews and monitors the services and activities performed by our officers, approves the engagement, and reviews the performance of, our independent registered public accounting firm, and provides overall risk management oversight. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Section 56(a) of the 1940 Act requires that at least a majority of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors be composed of independent Directors. To be considered independent, a Director may not be (i) an officer or employee of the Company, (ii) a direct or indirect beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Company&#8217;s voting shares, (iii) an immediate family member of an affiliate of the Company, (iv) any interested person of an investment adviser or principal underwriter to the Company, (v) legal counsel to the Company (or acted as such at any time during the preceding two completed fiscal years) or (vi) a person that has had a material business relationship with the Company at any time during the last two fiscal years. Our current Board of Directors consists of four members, three of whom we consider independent. 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is composed of Van Parker, Committee Chairman, Joel Stone, and Leonard Schiller. The Audit Committee&#8217;s responsibilities include overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, our systems of internal controls over financial reporting, and audits of our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We do not own any intellectual property rights except for our internet websites at the following URLs: www.pointcapitalinc.com and www.hempfundinginc.com. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have no employees and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer provide service on a part-time basis. Our chief executive office is also a director. All functions including development, strategy, negotiations and administration are currently being provided by our executive officers or outsourced to service providers. Our officers and directors do not work exclusively for us and do not devote all of their time to our operations. Their other activities prevent them from devoting their full-time to our operations. 

&#160; 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

&#160; 

From incorporation through December 31, 2013, we were treated as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#34;Code&#34;). Effective January 1, 2014, we elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Code. As explained below, we have made no provision for income taxes as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our continued qualification as a RIC requires that we comply with certain requirements contained in Subchapter M of the Code that may affect our ability to pursue additional business opportunities or strategies that, if we were to determine we should pursue, could diminish the desirability of qualifying, or impede our ability to qualify, as a RIC. For example, a RIC must meet certain requirements, including source of income and asset diversification requirements (as described below) and distributing annually at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement&#8221;). The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. 

&#160; 

A RIC generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any investment company taxable income (which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses) or any realized net capital gains (which is generally net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) that we distribute to our stockholders. We will be subject to United States federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

In order to qualify and continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain the tax benefits accorded to a RIC, in addition to satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement, we must, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Have in effect at all times during each taxable year an election to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities and (ii) net income derived from an interest in a &#8220;qualified publicly traded limited partnership&#8221; (the &#8220;90% Income Test&#8221;); and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#160; 

&#160; &#9675; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9675; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of one issuer, (ii) securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or (iii) securities of one or more &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#8221; (the &#8220;Diversification Tests&#8221;). &#160; 

Provided that we satisfy the Diversification Tests as of the close of any quarter, we will not fail the Diversification Tests as of the close of a subsequent quarter as a consequence of a discrepancy between the value of our assets and the requirements of the Diversification Tests that is attributable solely to fluctuations in the value of our assets. Rather, we will fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of a subsequent quarter only if such a discrepancy existed immediately after our acquisition of any asset and was wholly or partly the result of that acquisition. In addition, if we fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a RIC if we eliminate the discrepancy within thirty days of the end of such quarter and, if we eliminate the discrepancy within that thirty-day period, we will be treated as having satisfied the Diversification Tests as of the end of such quarter. 

&#160; 

We satisfied the above RIC requirements during each of the taxable years since our election to be treated as a RIC for tax purposes. Since we did not generate investment company taxable income in any of these taxable years, we were not required to make any distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. We did not generate any realized net capital gains in 2015 and 2014 and, as a result, we were not required to make any distributions to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, as described below. As such, we have not made any provision for federal income or excise taxes as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

Assuming we continue to qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated to the extent that we distribute any investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains to our stockholders. However, we will pay corporate-level federal income tax on any amount of realized net capital gain that we elect to retain. In the event we retain some or all of our realized net capital gains, we may designate the retained amount as a deemed distribution to stockholders. In such case, among other consequences, we will pay corporate-level tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include its share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit or refund equal to its allocable share of the corporate-level tax we pay on the retained realized net capital gain. The amount of the deemed distribution (net of such tax credit or refund) will be added to each U.S. stockholder's cost basis for its common stock. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a &#8220;deemed distribution.&#8221; 

&#160; 

As a RIC, we are also subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending December 31 in that calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and realized net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years (the &#8220;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#8221;). We will not be subject to this excise tax on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income tax (such as retained realized net capital gains which we designate as &#34;undistributed capital gain&#34; or a deemed distribution). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions (including deemed distributions of retained realized net capital gains) each taxable year to avoid the payment of this excise tax. 

&#160; 

A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income (which is likely to occur since our operating expenses are expected to exceed the amount of interest or dividend income we receive on our current portfolio company investments), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. We may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, our stockholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions. 

&#160; 

If we are unable to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Such distributions would be taxable to our stockholders. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 

&#160; 

If we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements in order to requalify as a RIC and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that were recognized within the subsequent 10 years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC. If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Test described above, however, we may be able to avoid losing our status as a RIC by timely providing notice of such failure to the IRS, curing such failure and possibly paying an additional tax. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation as a BDC 

&#160; 

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than &#34;interested persons,&#34; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC without the approval of a &#34;majority of our outstanding voting securities,&#34; within the meaning of the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

&#160; 

We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office.
