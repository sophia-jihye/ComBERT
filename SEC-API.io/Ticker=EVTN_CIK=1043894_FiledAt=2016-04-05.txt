Our History

Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Idaho on October 19, 1964, under the name Idaho Silver, Inc. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc., a Florida corporation ("FPA"), was incorporated on February 26, 1993.

General

We believe we are emerging as a potential leader in the rapidly growing environmental and industrial separation industries. The Company has developed, patented and manufactures the Voraxial &#174; Separator ("Voraxial Separator" or "Voraxial"), a proprietary technology that efficiently separates large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities. Management believes this superior separation quality is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact, cost effective and energy efficient machine than any comparable product on the market today. Management believes the Voraxial fills a void in the market; specifically a real-time separation device that separates a large volume of liquids with a small footprint and without the need of a pressure drop. We believe the need for such a separation device overlaps many markets. These benefits result in significant cost savings to the customer, both acquisition and operating cost.

The Voraxial is capable of processing volumes as low as 3 gallons per minute as well as volumes over 5,000 gallons per minute with only one moving part. The Company believes that the Voraxial technology can help protect the environment and its natural resources while simultaneously making numerous industries more productive and cost effective.

The size and efficiency advantages provided by the Voraxial Separator to the end-user have provided us with a variety of market opportunities. We believe separation of contaminants from water is needed in virtually every industry, either in the manufacturing or production side of the business or in purifying the wastewater prior to discharge. Because of the advantages the Voraxial Separator offers the end user, the Voraxial can be used in many different markets. This allows the Company to pursue its core market, oil and gas exploration and production, while responding and selling product to customers in other markets, including, but not limited to, oil spill, mining, and municipal wastewater. The Company is focusing its sales activity in the oil &#38; gas exploration and production market, which also includes the tar sands, Frac water, oil refineries and production facilities, both offshore and onshore applications.

We have generated limited revenues to date partially due to the time required to educate the market of our separation technology, partially because of insufficient funds to adequately market our product; and the time needed to secure and complete initial projects. However, with the dissemination of the data from our initial projects, we believe demand and interest for the Voraxial continues to increase. We are in various stages of negotiations with multiple customers interested in our Voraxial Separators and Voraxial Separator Systems. While we cannot provide any reasonable assurances, we believe a percentage of these negotiations will ultimately be consummated. If we fail to consummate any of these transactions, we may be required to scale back or cease operations, sell or liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection.

We are receiving inquiries from customers in various industries. Even though customers from various industries can utilize the Voraxial, we are currently focused on developing market channels to penetrate the oil and gas exploration and production market and more specifically, the produced water market. The Company believes that revenues from this industry will continue to increase in 2016 and beyond. We have completed multiple projects and trials to date with the Voraxial Separators (both offshore platforms and onshore production facilities) including units to PDVSA, Occidental, Transocean, Tetra Technologies, ConocoPhillips, GE, Sinopec, and the US Navy. We are in dialogue with other companies to conduct similar projects in 2016.

We also believe that our technology could have a significant impact on oil spill recovery. Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico we were included in British Petroleum RAT (Rapid Attack Team) Pack program. The "RAT Pack" program is a fleet of local commercial, shallow draft, nimble and fast moving vessels operating under the Vessels of Opportunity program.

During 2010, we finalized the development of the Submersible Voraxial Separator for oil spill recovery, which enables the operator to separate oil from water in the ocean. By conducting the separation in the ocean, management believes that vessels can skim ten times more oil since the amount of water collected in a vessel's holding tank is reduced by up to 90%. The collected oil will be discharged into a holding tank while the clean water remains in the ocean. This differs substantially from the current methods of skimming large volumes of oil/water mixture and then conducting the separation on vessel. Implementing this new method enables the vessels to process significantly more volume of skimmed oil/water mixture, collect more oil, capture a higher concentration of oil and remain in operation longer. We filed three patents related to oil spill recovery.

We have also developed a turnkey system can be utilized in multiple niche applications in the oil industry including produced water, deck water drainage, slopwater, FPSO (floating, production, storage and offloading) and refinery markets. The system integrates the Voraxial Separator as a bulk separator, coalescers to increase the droplet size of the dispersed oil and filters for the secondary process for polishing. The system can also include other equipment such as flow meters, turbidity meters, oil monitors and chemical injection ports. We believe the turnkey system will provide the oil industry with a compact and effective separation system. The Voraxial's small footprint, low energy requirements and separation quality coupled with unique filtration equipment for secondary treatment provides the customer with a complete turnkey package that meets the most stringent discharge levels such as OSPAR (North Sea countries &#60;30mg/ltr) and United States 40 CFR435 (&#60;29 mg/ltr). We have shipped various models of this system.

Voraxial &#174; Separator

The Voraxial Separator is a continuous flow turbo machine that generates a strong centrifugal force, a vortex, capable of separating light and heavy liquids, such as oil and water, or any other combination of liquids and solids at extremely high flow rates. As the fluid passes through the machine, the Voraxial Separator accomplishes this separation through the creation of a vortex. In liquid/liquid and liquid/solid mixtures, this vortex causes the heavier compounds to gravitate to the outside of the flow and the lighter elements to move to the center where an inner core is formed. The liquid stream processed by the machine is divided into separate streams of heavier and lighter liquids and solids. As a result of this process, separation is achieved.

The benefits of the Voraxial include:

-

High volume / small footprint

-

No Pressure drop requirement

-

High G force

-

Treats a wide range of flows, even slugging flows

-

Handles fluctuation in flow rates without any adjustments

-

Handles fluctuation in contaminates without any adjustments

-

Separation of 2 or 3 components simultaneously

-

Non-clogging - open rotor assembly

-

Low maintenance with ease of operation and installation

-

Can operate dry

-

Since there is no pressure drop, there is very little wear caused by sand

The Voraxial Separator is a self-contained, non-clogging device that can be powered by an electric motor, diesel engine or by hydraulic power generation. Further, the Voraxial Separator's scalability allows it to be utilized in a variety of industries and to process various amounts of liquid. The following are the various sizes and the corresponding capacity range:

The Voraxial Separator can transfer various liquids in either direction by reversing the machine's rotation. We currently maintain an inventory of various models of the Voraxial Separator.

Management believes that our Voraxial Separator offers substantial applications on a cost-effective basis, including: oil exploration &#38; production, oil remediation services, municipal wastewater treatment, bilge water purification, food processing waste treatment and numerous other industrial production and environmental remediation processes. We also believe that the quality of the water separated from the contaminant is good enough to recycle back into the process stream (back into the plant) or discharge to the environment. As clean water becomes less available to the ever-increasing world population, this technology may become more valuable.

The Market

The need for effective and cost efficient wastewater treatment and separation technology is global in scale. Moreover, virtually every industry requires some type of separation process either during the manufacturing process, prior to treatment or discharge of wastewater into the environment, for general clean up, or emergency response capability. Separation processes, however, are largely unknown to the average consumer. These processes are deeply integrated in almost all industrial processes from oil to wastewater to manufacturing. Management believes that the Voraxial technology has applications in most, if not all major separation industries. The unique characteristics of the Voraxial allow it to be utilized either as a stand-alone unit or within an existing system to provide a more efficient and cost effective way to handle the separation needs of the customer. We believe the Voraxial Separator can result in a cost savings and other benefits to the customer. These benefits result in and include:

&#9679;

A reduction in water and energy usage,

&#9679;

Requires no pressure drop to perform separation,

&#9679;

Less space needed to implement the Voraxial Separator, the Voraxial Separator weights less than existing systems,

&#9679;

A reduction time to process and separate the fluids, allowing the customer to be more efficient,

&#9679;

Creation of more efficient and faster process to treat water to increase the overall productivity of the end-user,

&#9679;

Fewer employees needed to operate the system, and

&#9679;

Reduction of ongoing maintenance and servicing costs.

We believe that we are the only front-end solution for the separation industry that can offer increased productivity while reducing the physical space and energy required to operate the unit. These advantages translate into the potential for substantial operating cost efficiencies that would increase the profitability of the solution's end user. The Voraxial's unique characteristic to conduct separation without a pressure loss allows the unit to be installed in locations other technologies cannot. For instance another separation technology in the oil industry called a hydrocyclone requires a significant pressure loss to perform separation. We believe this characteristic gives our customers a more practical way to achieve separation.

If, as we expect, environmental regulations, both domestically and internationally, become more stringent, companies will be required to more effectively treat their wastewater prior to discharge. We believe this offers a great opportunity for the Company as the Voraxial Separator can be utilized in most separation applications to significantly increase the efficiency of the separation processes while simultaneously reduce the cost to the end-user.

Management believes that the oil industry, and more specifically the produced water market within this industry, represents a great opportunity for significant sales growth for the Voraxial Separator. The produced water market is worldwide and the need for effective produced water (oil/water) separation is a major issue for both offshore and land-based oil production facilities. The ability to efficiently separate produced water waste streams (oil and water) has enormous economical and environmental consequences for the oil production industry. Produced water comprises over 98% of the total waste volume generated by the oil and gas industry, making it the largest volume waste stream associated with oil and gas production.

Oil reservoirs frequently contain large volumes of water and as oil wells mature (the oil field becomes depleted), the amount of produced water increases. In the continental US, it is estimated that 7-10 barrels of water is produced for each barrel of recovered oil. According to the Argonne National Laboratory 2007 White Paper, "approximately 15 to 20 billion bbl (barrels; 1 bbl = 42 U.S. gallons) of produced water are generated each year in the United States. This is equivalent to a volume of 1.7 to 2.3 billion gallons per day." Worldwide, the total amount of produced water generated, excluding the United States, is approximately 50 billion barrels (approximately 6 billion gallons per day). Produced water volumes will continue to increase as oil wells mature. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The necessity to process and efficiently separate high volumes of liquids coupled with the more stringent environmental regulations worldwide is increasing the demand for the Voraxial Separator. The Voraxial Separator provides a cost effective way to separate large volumes of produced or re-injection water for both on-land and offshore production facilities. The Voraxial provides superior separation while decreasing the amount of space, energy and weight to conduct the separation. In addition to oil separation, the Voraxial can also perform solid (sand and grit) extraction, which prevents production damage by increasing the life of the well.
