 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle Financial Partners is the second-largest bank holding company headquartered in Tennessee, with $8.72 billion in assets as of December 31, 2015. Incorporated on February 28, 2000, the holding company is the parent company of Pinnacle Bank and owns 100% of the capital stock of Pinnacle Bank. The firm started operations on October 27, 2000, in Nashville, Tennessee, and has since grown to 44 offices, including 29 in eight Middle Tennessee counties. The firm also has five offices in Knoxville, five offices in Memphis and one in Chattanooga, as well as several offices in nearby communities. Prior to September 4, 2012, when it converted from a national bank to a state bank, Pinnacle Bank was known as Pinnacle National Bank.

The firm operates as a community bank primarily in the urban markets of Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis and Chattanooga, Tennessee and surrounding counties. As an urban community bank, Pinnacle provides the personalized service most often associated with small community banks, while offering the sophisticated products and services, such as investments and treasury management, more typically found at large regional and national banks. This approach has enabled Pinnacle to attract clients from the regional and national banks in the Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis and Chattanooga MSAs and surrounding markets. As a result, Pinnacle has grown to the fourth largest market share in the Nashville MSA and to the sixth largest market share in the Knoxville MSA, based on 2015 FDIC Summary of Deposits data including the impact of any mergers and acquisitions. 

&#160;

ACQUISITIONS

In February 2015, Pinnacle Bank acquired a 30% membership interest in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG), a company which makes term loans to healthcare professionals and practices, for $75 million in cash. On January 19, 2016, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank entered into an agreement to acquire, at the closing of the investment, 8.55% and 10.45%, respectively, of the outstanding membership interests in BHG for $114.0 million, payable in a mix of cash and stock consideration. The cash consideration is expected to equal $74,100,000 and the stock consideration is expected to consist of a number of shares equal to the quotient (in whole shares) of (i) $39,900,000 and (ii) the closing price of Pinnacle Financial's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the day prior to the closing date of the additional investment. The closing of the additional investment is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and Pinnacle Financial's election to become a financial holding company which became effective February 17, 2016. We currently expect the closing to occur in early March 2016.

At the closing, Pinnacle Financial, Pinnacle Bank and the other members of BHG will enter into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of BHG that is currently expected to provide for, among other things, the following terms: (i) the inability of any member of BHG to transfer its ownership interest in BHG without the consent of the other members of BHG for five years, other than transfers to family members, trusts or affiliates of the transferring member, in connection with the acquisition of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank or as a result of a change in applicable law that forces Pinnacle Financial and/or Pinnacle Bank to divest their ownership interests in BHG; (ii) the inability of the board of managers of BHG (of which Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank will have the right to designate two of the five members (the "Pinnacle Managers")) to approve a sale of BHG for four years without the consent of one of the Pinnacle Managers; (iii) co-sale rights for the Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank in the event the other members of BHG decide to sell all or a portion of their ownership interests after the above-described five-year limitation; and (iv) a right of first refusal for BHG and the other members of BHG in the event that the Pinnacle Financial and/or Pinnacle Bank decide to sell all or a portion of their ownership interests after the above-described five-year limitation, except in connection with a transfer of their ownership interests to an affiliate or in connection with the acquisition of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank.

In July 2015, we completed our acquisition of CapitalMark Bank &#38; Trust ("CapitalMark") for approximately $19.7 million in cash (including payments related to fractional shares) and 3,306,184 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock valued at approximately $175.5 million. All of CapitalMark's outstanding stock options vested upon consummation of the CapitalMark acquisition and were converted into options to purchase shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock at the common stock exchange rates. The fair market value of stock options assumed was approximately $30.4 million. The CapitalMark merger increased our presence in the Knoxville MSA and expanded our operations into the Chattanooga, Tennessee-Georgia MSA and surrounding counties.

In September 2015, we completed our acquisition of Magna Bank ("Magna Bank") for an aggregate of $19.5 million in cash (including payments related to fractional shares) and 1,371,717 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock valued at approximately $63.5 million. Additionally, at the time of the merger there were 139,417 unexercised stock options that were exchanged for cash equal to $14.32 less the respective exercise price. This consideration totaled approximately $847,000, including all applicable payroll taxes. The Magna merger increased our presence in the Memphis, Tennessee-Mississippi-Arkansas MSA.

On January 28, 2016, entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc. ("Avenue") will merge with and into Pinnacle Financial, with Pinnacle Financial continuing as the surviving corporation. The separate existence of Avenue shall cease to exist upon the effectiveness of the Avenue merger. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Pinnacle Bank and Avenue Bank, Avenue's wholly owned bank subsidiary, have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Avenue Bank will merge with and into Pinnacle Bank simultaneously with the consummation of the Avenue merger.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon consummation of the Avenue merger each holder of Avenue common stock issued and outstanding, subject to certain exceptions, will be eligible to receive 0.36 shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock and an amount in cash equal to $2.00 for each share of Avenue common stock owned by them at the effective time of the Avenue merger. The transaction is currently valued at approximately $201.4 million based on Pinnacle's 10-day average closing price through the date of the merger agreement, and consists in the aggregate of stock consideration of approximately 3.7 million shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock and approximately $23.2 million in cash.

Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the average closing price of Pinnacle Financial's common stock for the ten (10) trading days ending on the business day immediately preceding the closing date of the merger. Additionally, any outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock of Avenue that are not vested will be accelerated prior to, but conditioned on the occurrence of, the closing of the merger and all options that are not exercised prior to the closing shall be cancelled and the holders of any such options shall receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of $20.00 over the exercise price of each such option and (y) the number of shares of Avenue common stock subject to each such option. In addition, upon consummation of the Avenue merger, Pinnacle Financial will assume Avenue's obligations under its outstanding $20.0 million subordinated notes issued in December 2014 that mature in December 2024. These notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum until January 1, 2020 and may not be repaid prior to such date. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if not redeemed on such date, these notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 4.95%.

The proposed Avenue merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including obtaining approvals from applicable federal and state banking regulators and Avenue's shareholders; it is currently expected to close either late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Lending Services

We offer a full range of lending products, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans to individuals and small-to medium-sized businesses and professional entities. We compete for these loans with competitors who are also well established in our geographic markets.

Pinnacle Bank's loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. When the total amount of loans to a single borrower exceeds an individual officer's lending authority, officers with higher lending authority determine whether to approve any new loan requests or renewals of existing loans. Loans to insiders require approval of the board, and, certain extensions of credit, including loans above certain amounts and certain adversely classified loans, require approval of a committee of the board.

Pinnacle Bank's lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal and state law. Differing limits apply based on the type of loan or the nature of the borrower, including the borrower's relationship to Pinnacle Bank. In general, however, at December 31, 2015, we were able to loan any one borrower a maximum amount equal to approximately $105.6 million plus an additional $70.4 million, or a total of approximately $176.0 million, for loans that meet certain additional collateral guidelines. These legal limits will increase or decrease as Pinnacle Bank's capital increases or decreases as a result of its earnings or losses, the injection of additional capital, payments of dividends, acquisitions, or for other reasons. Pinnacle Bank's internal loan limit of $30 million is less than the legal lending limit, and Pinnacle Bank currently has three relationships in excess of the internal loan limit. These relationships range from $34.0 million to $40.0 million and were each approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. 

The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans that Pinnacle Bank expects to make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. General economic factors affecting a commercial or consumer borrower's ability to repay include interest, inflation and unemployment rates, as well as other factors affecting a borrower's assets, clients, suppliers and employees. Many of Pinnacle Bank's commercial loans are made to small- to medium-sized businesses that are sometimes less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. During periods of economic weakness these businesses may be more adversely affected than other enterprises and may cause increased levels of nonaccrual or other problem loans, loan charge-offs and higher provision for loan losses.

&#160;

Pinnacle Bank's commercial clients borrow for a variety of purposes. The terms of these loans (which include equipment loans and working capital loans) will vary by purpose and by type of any underlying collateral. Commercial loans may be unsecured or secured by accounts receivable or by other business assets. Pinnacle Bank also makes a variety of commercial real estate loans, including both investment properties and business loans secured by real estate.

Pinnacle Bank also makes a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family, investment and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans and lines of credit, residential first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.

Deposit Services

Pinnacle Bank seeks to establish a broad base of core deposits, including savings, checking, interest-bearing checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts. To attract deposits, Pinnacle Bank has employed a marketing plan in its current geographic markets primarily based on relationship banking and features a broad product line and competitive rates and services. The primary sources of deposits are individuals and businesses located in those geographic markets. Pinnacle Bank traditionally has obtained these deposits primarily through personal solicitation by its officers and directors, although its use of media advertising has increased in recent years, primarily due to its advertising and banking sponsorship with the Tennessee Titans NFL football team.

Pinnacle Bank also offers its targeted commercial clients a comprehensive array of treasury management services as well as remote deposit services, which allow electronic deposits to be made from the client's place of business.

Investment, Trust and Insurance Services

Pinnacle Bank contracts with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (RJFS), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, to offer and sell various securities and other financial products to the public from Pinnacle Bank's locations through Pinnacle Bank employees that are also RJFS employees. RJFS is a subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Pinnacle Bank offers, through RJFS, non-FDIC insured investment products in order to assist Pinnacle Bank's clients in achieving their financial objectives consistent with their risk tolerances. These financial products are offered by RJFS from Pinnacle Bank's main office and many of its other offices. Additionally, we believe that the brokerage and investment advisory program offered by RJFS complements Pinnacle Bank's general banking business, and further supports its business philosophy and strategy of delivering to our clients those products and services that meet their financial needs. Pursuant to its contract with us, RJFS is primarily responsible for the compliance monitoring of dual employees of RJFS and Pinnacle Bank. Additionally, Pinnacle Bank has developed its own compliance-monitoring program in an effort to further ensure that Pinnacle Bank personnel deliver these products in a manner consistent with the various regulations governing such activities. Pinnacle Bank receives a percentage of commission credits and fees generated by the program. Pinnacle Bank remains responsible for various expenses associated with the program, including promotional expenses, furnishings and equipment expenses and general personnel costs including commissions paid to licensed brokers.

Pinnacle Bank also maintains a trust department which provides fiduciary and investment management services for individual and commercial clients. Account types include personal trust, endowments, foundations, individual retirement accounts, pensions and custody. Pinnacle Advisory Services, Inc., a registered investment advisor, provides investment advisory services to its clients. Additionally, Miller Loughry Beach Insurance Services, Inc., an insurance agency subsidiary of Pinnacle Bank, provides insurance products, particularly in the property and casualty area, to its clients.

&#160;

M&#38;A Advisory and Securities Offering Services

In 2015, we formed PNFP Capital Markets, a registered broker dealer that will partner with our financial advisors to offer corporate clients merger &#38; acquisition advisory services, private debt, equity and mezzanine, interest rate derivatives and other selected middle-market advisory services.

&#160;

Other Banking Services

&#160;

Given client demand for being able to access banking and investment services easily, Pinnacle Bank also offers a broad array of convenience-centered products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, mobile banking, debit and credit cards, direct deposit, remote deposit and cash management services for small- to medium-sized businesses. Additionally, Pinnacle Bank is associated with a nationwide network of automated teller machines of other financial institutions that our clients are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, Pinnacle Bank reimburses its clients for any fees that may be charged to the client for using the nationwide ATM network, providing greater convenience as compared to regional competitors.

Competitive Conditions

The four markets in which we currently operate are very competitive. The Nashville MSA banking market consists of 63 financial institutions with over $48.3 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015, up from approximately $44.1 billion at June 30, 2014 according to FDIC data. As of June 30, 2000, approximately 62.8% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Nashville, consisting of the following: Regions Financial (headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama), Bank of America (headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina), and SunTrust (headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia). According to FDIC deposit information, the collective market share of deposits in the Nashville MSA of Regions Financial (including the acquired Union Planters National Bank and AmSouth Bank), Bank of America, and SunTrust (including the acquired National Bank of Commerce) declined from approximately 62.8% to 43.9% between June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2015. Pinnacle Bank, on the other hand, after thirteen years of operations, holds the No. 4 deposit market share position in the Nashville MSA at June 30, 2015 with 9.2% of the deposit market share, immediately behind the top three out-of-state banks.

The Knoxville MSA banking market consists of 51 financial institutions with over $15.1 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $14.7 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2007, approximately 53.2% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Knoxville, consisting of the following: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. According to FDIC deposit information, the collective market share of deposits in the Knoxville MSA of First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial declined from 53.2% to 48.4% between June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2015. A significant portion of the decline in market share for the top three competitors since June 30, 2007 has occurred since Pinnacle Bank established a presence in the Knoxville MSA in 2007. At June 30, 2015, Pinnacle Bank had approximately 4.9% of the deposit market share in the Knoxville MSA.

The Chattanooga MSA banking market consists of 28 financial institutions with over $9.0 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $8.5 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 56.6% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Chattanooga, consisting of the following: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. During the third quarter of 2015, Pinnacle Financial acquired CapitalMark Bank &#38; Trust (CapitalMark) and thus entered the Chattanooga MSA. At June 30, 2015, CapitalMark had approximately 6.6% of the deposit market share in the Chattanooga MSA.

The Memphis MSA banking market is comprised of 56 financial institutions with over $27.0 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $23.7 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 56.2% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks two of which are headquartered outside of Memphis, consisting of the following: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. During the third quarter of 2015, Pinnacle Financial acquired Magna Bank (Magna) and thus entered the Memphis MSA. At June 30, 2015, Magna had approximately 1.7% of the deposit market share in the Memphis MSA.

We believe that the most important criteria to our bank's targeted clients when selecting a bank is their desire to receive exceptional and personal customer service while being able to enjoy convenient access to a broad array of financial products. Additionally, when presented with a choice, we believe that many of our bank's targeted clients would prefer to deal with a locally-owned institution headquartered in Tennessee, like Pinnacle Bank, as opposed to a large, multi-state bank, where many important decisions regarding a client's financial affairs are made elsewhere.

&#160;

Employees

As of February 15, 2016, we employed 1,065 full-time equivalent associates. We believe these associates are Pinnacle's most important asset and have created a culture where associates are engaged and excited to come to work. This is supported by the fact that we were inducted into the Nashville Business Journal 's "Best Places to Work" Hall of Fame after winning the award for 10 consecutive years. Additionally, consulting firm Great Place to Work recognized us as one of the best workplaces in the United States on its 2013 and 2014 Best Small &#38; Medium Workplaces list published in FORTUNE magazine. American Banker also recognized Pinnacle Bank as one of the top three "Best Banks to Work For" in the country in 2013, 2014 and 2015. All of these awards place heavy emphasis on anonymous surveys of associates in the judging criteria. 

&#160;

OTHER INFORMATION

Investment Securities

In addition to loans, Pinnacle Bank has investments primarily in United States agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal securities. No investment in any of those instruments exceeds any applicable limitation imposed by law or regulation. The executive committee of the board of directors reviews the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the investments conform to Pinnacle Bank's asset liability management policy as set by the board of directors. 

Asset and Liability Management 

&#160;

Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), composed of senior managers of Pinnacle Bank, manages Pinnacle Bank's assets and liabilities and strives to provide a stable, optimized net interest income and margin, adequate liquidity and ultimately a suitable after-tax return on assets and return on equity. ALCO conducts these management functions within the framework of written policies that Pinnacle Bank's board of directors has adopted. ALCO works to maintain an acceptable position between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. The executive committee of the board of directors oversees the ALCO function on an ongoing basis.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and borrowers, not stockholders.

&#160;

Pinnacle Financial

Pinnacle Financial is a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a result, it is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.

Acquisition of Banks. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve's prior approval before:

&#8226; Acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank's voting shares; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Subject to certain exemptions, merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 

&#160;

Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, or result in or tend to create a monopoly, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned; the effectiveness of the company in combating money laundering; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the extent to which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risk to the United States banking or financial system.

&#160;

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, if well-capitalized and well managed, a bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee. In each case, however, state law restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for three years.

&#160;

Change in Bank Control. Subject to various exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control is refutably presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either:

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; The bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; No other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

Pinnacle Financial's common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The regulations provide a procedure for challenge of the rebuttable control presumption.

Permitted Activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 amended the Bank Holding Company Act and expanded the activities in which bank holding companies and affiliates of banks are permitted to engage. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial service providers, and provided that holding companies which elected to become financial holding companies could engage in activities that are:

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Financial in nature; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Incidental to a financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury); or 

&#160; &#160; &#8226; Complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as determined by the Federal Reserve). 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expressly lists the following activities as financial in nature:

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Lending, trust and other banking activities; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss or harm, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker for these purposes, in any state; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Providing financial, investment, or advisory services; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Activities permitted outside of the United States that the Federal Reserve has determined to be usual in connection with banking or other financial operations abroad; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Merchant banking through securities or insurance affiliates; and 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Insurance company portfolio investments. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, to determine activities in addition to those listed above that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. In determining whether a particular activity is financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity, the Federal Reserve must consider (1) the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, (2) changes or reasonably expected changes in the marketplace in which financial holding companies compete and in the technology for delivering financial services, and (3) whether the activity is necessary or appropriate to allow financial holding companies to effectively compete with other financial service providers and to efficiently deliver information and services. Pinnacle Financial became a financial holding company effective as of February 17, 2016.

&#160;

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be "well capitalized" and "well managed." A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be "well capitalized" if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned "Capital Adequacy" below. A depository institution subsidiary is considered "well managed" if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination. A financial holding company's status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as "well capitalized" and "well managed" under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve's regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company's depository institutions.

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the Bank Holding Company Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the Bank Holding Company Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act.

&#160;

Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company's continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any of its bank subsidiaries. 

&#160;

Support of Subsidiary Institutions. Pinnacle Financial is required to act as a source of financial strength for its bank subsidiary, Pinnacle Bank, and to commit resources to support Pinnacle Bank. This support can be required at times when it would not be in the best interest of Pinnacle Financial's stockholders or creditors to provide it. In the event of Pinnacle Financial's bankruptcy, any commitment by it to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Pinnacle Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Pinnacle Bank

Pinnacle Financial owns one bank - Pinnacle Bank. Pinnacle Bank is a state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Tennessee that is not a member of the Federal Reserve. As a result, it is subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements and the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (TDFI). The TDFI has the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the issuance of preferred stock and capital notes, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The TDFI regularly examines state banks like Pinnacle Bank and in connection with its examinations may identify matters necessary to improve a bank's operation in accordance with principles of safety and soundness. Any matters identified in such examinations are required to be appropriately addressed by the bank. Pinnacle Bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business, activities and operations.

Branching. While the TDFI has authority to approve branch applications, state banks are required by the State of Tennessee to adhere to branching laws applicable to state chartered banks in the states in which they are located. With prior regulatory approval, Tennessee law permits banks based in the state to either establish new or acquire existing branch offices throughout Tennessee. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Pinnacle Bank and any other national or state-chartered bank generally may branch across state lines to the same extent as banks chartered in the state of the branch.

FDIC Insurance. Deposits in Pinnacle Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 subject to applicable limitations. To offset the cost of this issuance, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted regulations that base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. After an institution's average assets exceed $10 billion over four quarters, the assessment rate increases compared to institutions at lower average asset levels.

&#160;

The FDIC may terminate its insurance of an institution's deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy

&#160;

The Federal Reserve has established a risk-based and a leverage measure of capital adequacy for bank holding companies. Pinnacle Bank is also subject to risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, which are substantially similar to those adopted by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance-sheet items, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items. Tennessee state banks are required to have the capital structure that the TDFI deems adequate, and the Commissioner of the TDFI may require a state bank to increase its capital structure to the point deemed adequate by the Commissioner before granting approval of a branch application, merger application or charter amendment.

Under Federal Reserve regulations for bank holding companies applicable prior to January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was 8%. Total capital consisted of two components, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets. The trust preferred securities previously issued by Pinnacle Financial qualified as Tier 1 capital, and as described below will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. Under Federal Reserve regulations, Tier 1 capital must equal at least 6% of risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital generally consists of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves. The total amount of Tier 2 capital is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital. For a holding company to be considered "well-capitalized," it was required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and not be subject to a written agreement, order or directive to maintain a specific capital level.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio regulations for bank holding companies. These regulations require a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, less goodwill, other intangible assets and other required deductions, of at least 4%. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve indicated that it will consider a bank holding company's Tier 1 capital leverage ratio, after deducting all intangibles, and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions dealing with capital adequacy of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, and for the most part these provisions have resulted in insured depository institutions and their holding companies being subject to more stringent capital requirements. Under the so-called Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators have established minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for, among other entities, banks and bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. These minimum requirements require that a bank holding company maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of not less than 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 8%. The Collins Amendment also excludes trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 from being included in Tier 1 capital unless the issuing company is a bank holding company with less than $500 million in total assets. Trust preferred securities issued prior to that date will continue to count as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets on that date. Pinnacle Financial's trust preferred securities will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital.

&#160;

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial, effective January 1, 2015. The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in "Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems" (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Under these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective as to Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank on January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Moreover, these rules refine the definition of what constitutes "capital" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% (to be phased in over three years) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. For the quarters ending in calendar year 2016, neither Pinnacle Financial nor Pinnacle Bank will be required to obtain regulatory approval for dividends, stock repurchases or payment of discretionary bonuses as long as its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio exceeds 5.125%, its Tier 1 capital ratio exceeds 6.625% and its total capital ratio exceeds 8.625%. These amounts will increase in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Under these new rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including, in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets on December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.

Common equity Tier 1 capital will generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions, including a portion of Pinnacle Bank's recorded investment in BHG (which as a minority interest in an unconsolidated financial institution is subject to specified deductions).

The final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank each opted out of this requirement.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations applicable to bank holding companies with assets over $10 billion that require such holding companies and banks to conduct annual stress tests and report the results to the applicable regulators and publicly disclose a summary of certain capital information and results including pro forma changes in regulatory capital ratios. For such companies, the board of directors and senior management is required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including but not limited to capital planning and an assessment of capital adequacy in accordance with management's policies. Pinnacle Financial anticipates that it will be required to file its first stress test results in the first quarter of 2018 if its total assets exceed $10 billion in 2016.

&#160;

Pinnacle Financial must qualify as "well capitalized," among other requirements, in order for it to engage in certain acquisitions or be eligible for expedited treatment of certain regulatory applications, including those related to mergers and acquisitions. For Pinnacle Financial to qualify as "well capitalized," it must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and not be subject to a written agreement, order or directive to maintain a specific capital level. 

&#160;

Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital requirements or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution by its regulators could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business.

&#160;

Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into one of which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator within a specified period for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category.

Under FDIC regulations, a state regulated bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve (a state nonmember bank) is "well capitalized" if it has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5% or better, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or better, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or better, a total risk based capital ratio of 10% or better, and is not subject to a regulatory agreement, order or directive to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. A state nonmember bank is considered "adequately capitalized" if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or better, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized bank. Lower levels of capital result in a bank being considered undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.

&#160;

State nonmember banks are required to be "well capitalized" in order to take advantage of expedited procedures on certain applications, such as those related to the opening of branches and mergers, and to accept and renew brokered deposits without further regulatory approval.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. In addition, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company's obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary's assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution into a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. As of December 31, 2014, Pinnacle Bank is considered "well-capitalized".

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, Pinnacle Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.0%, its total risk-based capital ratio was 10.6% and its leverage ratio was 8.8%, compared to 10.8%, 11.4%, 12.6% and 10.6% at December 31, 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015, Pinnacle Financial's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.6%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.6%, its total risk-based capital ratio was 11.2% and its leverage ratio was 9.4%, compared to 10.1%, 12.1%, 13.4% and 11.3% at December 31, 2014, respectively. More information concerning Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's regulatory ratios at December 31, 2015 is included in Note 22 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Payment of Dividends

Pinnacle Financial is a legal entity separate and distinct from Pinnacle Bank. The principal source of Pinnacle Financial's cash flow, including cash flow to pay interest to its holders of subordinated debentures, and any dividends payable to common stockholders, are dividends that Pinnacle Bank pays to Pinnacle Financial as its sole stockholder. Under Tennessee law, Pinnacle Financial is not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if it were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, Pinnacle Financial's board of directors must consider its and Pinnacle Bank's current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs.

In addition to state law limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends, the Federal Reserve imposes limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends. As noted above, effective January 1, 2016, Federal Reserve regulations limit dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if Pinnacle Financial's regulatory capital is below the level of regulatory minimums plus the applicable capital conservation buffer which will increase each year until January 1, 2019.

&#160;

Statutory and regulatory limitations also apply to Pinnacle Bank's payment of dividends to Pinnacle Financial. Pinnacle Bank is required by Tennessee law to obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI for payments of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (1) the total of Pinnacle Bank's net income for that year, plus (2) Pinnacle Bank's retained net income for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2015, Pinnacle Bank could pay dividends to us of up to $180.0 million. Generally, federal regulatory policy encourages holding company debt to be serviced by subsidiary bank dividends or additional equity rather than debt issuances. Pinnacle Financial currently has available cash balances which amounted to approximately $21.7 million at December 31, 2015.

The payment of dividends by Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above statutory and regulatory requirements imposed on Pinnacle Bank or Pinnacle Financial by their regulators. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured depository institutions should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings, and the new capital rules prohibit the payment of dividends when a holding company or insured depository institution is not in compliance with the capital conservation buffer described elsewhere in this report. See "Capital Adequacy" above.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Pinnacle Financial Partners initiated a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of $0.08 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Pinnacle Financial Partners paid $18.3 million in dividends to common shareholders. On January 19, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a $0.14 quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate $5.7 million in aggregate dividend payments that will paid on February 26, 2016 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 5, 2016. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to Board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us. 

&#160;

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates

&#160;

Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A places limits on the amount of:

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; A bank's loans or extensions of credit, including purchases of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, to or for the benefit of affiliates; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; A bank's investment in affiliates; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; The amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Transactions involving the borrowing or lending of securities and any derivative transaction that results in credit exposure to an affiliate; and 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; A bank's guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. 

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank's capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. Pinnacle Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets.

Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

Pinnacle Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC shall evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on Pinnacle Bank. Additionally, banks are required to publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. Pinnacle Bank received a "satisfactory" CRA rating from its primary federal regulator on its most recent regulatory examination.

Privacy

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions' own products and services. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers. Pinnacle Bank has established a privacy policy that it believes promotes compliance with these federal requirements.

Other Consumer Laws and Regulations

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Pinnacle Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. For example, under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, a lender is generally prohibited from charging an annual interest rate in excess of 6% on any obligations for which the borrower is a person on active duty with the United States military. Pinnacle Bank's loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in active military service; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing the federal laws.

Pinnacle Bank's deposit operations are subject to the:

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 

&#160; &#160; 

&#8226; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities (including with respect to the permissibility of overdraft charges) arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

&#160;

Pinnacle Bank's loan and deposit operations are both subject to the Bank Secrecy Act which governs how banks and other firms report certain currency transactions and maintain appropriate safeguards against "money laundering" activities.

&#160;

Anti-Terrorism Legislation

On October 26, 2001, the President of the United States signed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and "know your customer" standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers.

In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to adopt rules increasing the cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Any financial institution complying with these rules will not be deemed to have violated the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as discussed above. Pinnacle Bank currently has policies and procedures in place designed to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act.

Recent and Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action

New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which includes significant consumer protection provisions related to, among other things, residential mortgage loans that have increased, and are likely to further increase, our regulatory compliance costs. We expect that the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to have a negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, particularly as we approach a level of total assets in excess of $10 billion. Upon consummation of our proposed merger with Avenue, which we expect will cause us to exceed $10 billion in total assets, we will also need to comply with certain additional requirements created by the Dodd-Frank Act that apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $10 billion or more in total assets. Failure to comply with the new requirements would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our growth or expansion activities. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, such changes could be materially adverse to our investors. 

&#160;

Set out below are certain of the additional provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that will become applicable to Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank once our total assets exceed $10 billion.

Risk Committee . Publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets are required to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices. The committee must include at least one risk management expert with experience in managing risk exposures of large, complex firms. We will need to comply with this requirement beginning in 2017 if we, as we currently expect, surpass the $10 billion total asset threshold upon consummation of our proposed merger with Avenue.

Stress Testing . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, any banking organization, including whether a bank holding company or a depository institution, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and regulated by a federal financial regulatory agency is required to conduct annual stress tests to ensure it has sufficient capital during periods of economic downturn. The Federal Reserve and FDIC release stress-test scenarios on November 15 of each year, and banking organizations are required to submit the results of their tests to the appropriate regulator by March 31 of the following year. The results of each year's stress tests are publicly disclosed in June, following each banking organization's submission. A banking organization that crosses the $10 billion total consolidated assets threshold must conduct its first annual company-run stress test in the second calendar quarter for the first year after the year in which it crossed the $10 billion threshold. For example, if we pass the $10 billion threshold in 2016, as we expect will be the case if we complete our proposed merger with Avenue, our first annual stress test would occur in 2017 and would be submitted to the appropriate federal regulators in 2018. Almost all of our assets are held at Pinnacle Bank. If Pinnacle Financial's total assets pass the $10 billion threshold, it is very likely that Pinnacle Bank's total assets will also pass $10 billion, and we will be required to conduct stress tests at both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank.

Durbin Amendment . The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions (known as the "Durbin Amendment") which restrict interchange fees to those which are "reasonable and proportionate" for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing. The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. In the final rules, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate. The interchange fee restrictions contained in the Durbin Amendment, and the rules promulgated thereunder, only apply to debit card issuers with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which we expect we will reach after the completion of the Avenue merger. We anticipate that the implications of the Durbin Amendment will first become applicable to us beginning in the quarter after we complete our merger with Avenue.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), which took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, on July 21, 2011. Institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of Pinnacle Bank, the FDIC). Since we expect to exceed the $10 billion threshold upon the consummation of our proposed merger with Avenue, we will become subject to oversight by the CFPB in 2016.

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive, or abusive" acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer's ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer's (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer's interests. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction.

The rules issued by the CFPB will have a long-term impact on our business, including our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will increase our overall regulatory compliance costs.

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies

Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve's monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the Federal Reserve's statutory power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve, through its monetary and fiscal policies, affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
