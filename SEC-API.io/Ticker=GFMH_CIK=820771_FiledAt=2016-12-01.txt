 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Background. 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name &#8220;China Advanced Technology&#8221; as the successor by merger to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. (&#8220;Vitalcare&#8221;). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent a holding company reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding Corporation, and Vitalcare, together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding Corporation subsequently reincorporated in Nevada by merger into China Advanced. 

&#160; 

Vitalcare was in the business of administering medical clinics specializing in diabetes treatment. It was the successor to Network Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;Network&#8221;), which went public in an underwritten offering in 1987. Network was engaged in mortgage origination, and changed its name to Westmark Group Holdings (&#8220;Westmark&#8221;) in 1993 in connection with the acquisition of Westmark Mortgage from Primark Corporation. Westmark ceased operations at some time in 2006, and in 2006 ceased filing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The corporate entity was thereafter known as Viking Consolidated, Inc. (2006), Tailor Aquaponics World Wide, Inc. (2007) and Diversified Acquisitions (2007) until it entered the medical clinic business in early 2008. The Company has no information regarding any business activities from 2006 after the mortgage origination business closed, to early 2008. 

&#160; 

On October 25, 2011, Goliath Film and Media International, a California corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Goliath Film and Media International was acquired by China Advanced Technology. Prior to the acquisition, our principal operations consisted of internet marketing, and were conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary, Live Wise, Inc. Live Wise was disposed of on October 31, 2011 for cancellation of debt and shares described below. At the Closing Date, there were no assets or liabilities on China Advanced Technology&#8217;s balance sheets. 

&#160; 

The transaction closed on October 31, 2011 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;). On the Closing Date China Advanced Technology acquired Goliath Film and Media International by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares after giving effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology&#8217;s prior control person. Immediately following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name of China Advanced Technology was changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings. All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an eight-for-1 forward stock split affected as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on February 13, 2012. 

&#160; 

Overview. 

&#160; 

Goliath Film and Media Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Goliath Film and Media International and Goliath Movie Partners 1, LLC (collectively, &#8220;Goliath&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), develops, produces and licenses for distribution, domestically and internationally, quality digital content with an emphasis on &#8220;niche&#8221; markets of the feature motion picture and television content segments of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, faith-based, horror and socially responsible minority content. Goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any significant extent. 

&#160; 

In qualified cases, Goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production, but will be licensed for distribution through the Company. Also, in certain cases Goliath will produce content that is tied to working with an established distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed by the participating distributor. Goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally, through a wide distribution network which includes major international theatrical exhibitors, and other distributors and television networks. We plan to utilize corporate sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution. Further, we may augment our marketing efforts with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional &#8220;print&#8221; media with press releases targeted specifically toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an &#8220;as needed&#8221; basis as well as the inclusion of targeted &#8220;social media&#8221; campaigns. 

&#160; 

Goliath&#8217;s revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees. A limited number of its content properties include projects developed and produced by Goliath and those produced by an independent third party production entity.

Questions and Answers 

&#160; 

What is your business? 

&#160; 

We develop, produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content. At this time we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases of motion pictures, due to the high up- front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically. However, in some specific cases the company will consider theatrical releases based upon a &#8220;four wall, &#8220; limited release delivery that will be focused on targeted niche audiences.

Additionally, the Company will receive two on screen credits as Executive Producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising, publicity and packaging of the motion picture. The investment of $15,000 presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid, due to the fact that no revenues will be generated until this motion picture&#8217;s released. 

&#160; 

What is the timeline for your activities during the next 12 months? 

&#160; 

Over the next 90 days to one year, our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by them of at least three projects. 

&#160; 

What is this going to cost you? 

&#160; 

We expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately $150,000 per project, however licensing and distribution will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from 30 &#8211; 35% and the costs of advertising and marketing will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds. 

&#160; 

Why are these motion pictures not being distributed already? 

&#160; 

The motion pictures that are being produced by the Company and distributed by Mar Vista Entertainment, LLC take anywhere from six to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements. 

&#160; 

Generically, the main reason why good, quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity, and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills. Many people dream of making a movie; few aspire to distribute them. We estimate that there are in excess of 10,000 such motion pictures &#8220;gathering dust.&#8221; There also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many States and international Territories, so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects. A secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor. We think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content. Finally, many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films, because they see the market as limited. Goliath sees the problem to be, rather, there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches. Most participants in the motion picture industry are based in &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; and the major coastal metropolitan areas. Our &#8220;faith-based&#8221; films especially are targeted toward the &#8220;Bible Belt&#8221; and the &#8220;Flyover Country&#8221;: places that the industry has consistently overlooked. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

Why are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos? 

&#160; 

After attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years, our Staff has developed relationships with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath has also developed vital relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks. Many of the filmmakers have requested the Company&#8217;s assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators, distributors, networks and studios. 

&#160; 

So how are you different than Amazon, Netflix, Blockbuster and Hulu, to name a few? How can you compete with them? They have a lot of money and name recognition. Why wouldn&#8217;t they jump into your niches? 

&#160; 

As a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content. As an example, NETFLIX has such a high demand for programming content, they are spending $5 billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them. Therefore, as is mentioned, part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting in-house&#8221; and joint venture production of quality content. This content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level. 

&#160; 

There are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors, Goliath is moving toward becoming one of these content providers. We believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming is increasing almost exponentially. Irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumer/subscriber, the demand for quality content is continuing to expand. As an example there are currently, approximately 416 original scripted programs being aired in the entire television universe &#8211; a cancellation rate of 10% reflects a number that represents the entire programming universe in the late 1990&#8217;s and early 2000&#8217;s.. The upward trend is ongoing, which is where we see an opportunity for Goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market. 

&#160; 

Don&#8217;t cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like TBN (for faith based) and BET (Black Entertainment Television (for the African-American Community)? 

&#160; 

As mentioned above about NETFLIX, even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type, genre and format of the content that they are showing in order to remain viable, therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing and expanding.. 

&#160; 

What other niches are you looking at entering? 

&#160; 

We believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches. Many viewers have cable or satellite service with hundreds of channels, but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests. One significant type of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the United States. Other than Spanish speaking immigrants, coverage is scarce. The last official data (2004) from the US Census Bureau is that 34.2 million persons in the US are foreign born, with 54% from Latin America, 25% from Asia and 14% from Europe. Foreign-born immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries. 

&#160; 

There are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming. As an example in Hawaii and Southern California, for instance, Surfing is quite popular, and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest. 

&#160; 

What about ancillary markets? 

&#160; 

We plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible. 

&#160; 

What films do you have now in inventory? 

&#160; 

We presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures: , Seducing Spirits, The Perfect Argument, Marina Murders, Film Struggle, Divorce in America, A Wonderful Summer, The Truth About Layla, Living with Cancer, The Biggest Fan, Days of Redemption, On Borrowed Time, Tumbleweed, Virus X, Farewell, Buddies, and The Pit . Under the distribution agreements Goliath will receive 30% of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute. In general, our distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements; however, for the picture The Biggest Fan we obtained limited distribution rights. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

How do these distribution rights work? 

&#160; 

We enter into a Distribution Agreement for each motion picture. Terms may be perpetual or limited by years. The motion pictures that we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years. We will generally obtain a fee of 20% to 30% of gross revenues. Licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multi-year basis. Most markets, especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing. 

&#160; 

How many employees do you have? Do you have an office? 

&#160; 

We have just 3 employees and we believe that is sufficient during the development, production and &#8220;content aggregation&#8221; phase of our development. Our administrative office is in Marina del Rey, California. 

&#160; 

Do you have a website? 

&#160; 

Our website is www.goliathfilmandmediainternational.com. We have a mirror site at www.goliathfilmandmedia.com.
