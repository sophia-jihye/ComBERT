 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Pain Therapeutics, Inc. develops proprietary drugs that offer significant improvements to patients and healthcare professionals. We generally focus our drug development efforts on disorders of the nervous system, such as chronic pain. 

&#160; 

Our expertise consists of developing new drug candidates and guiding these through various regulatory and development pathways in preparation for their eventual commercialization. By necessity, the conduct of drug development is complex, lengthy, expensive and risky. The FDA has not yet established the safety or efficacy of our drug candidates. 

&#160; 

For over a decade, we have pioneered technology, tools and techniques that enable the development of Abuse-Deterrent Formulations, or ADFs. ADFs are intended to make opioid drugs difficult to abuse yet provide steady pain relief when used appropriately by patients. ADFs are intended to help in the fight against prescription drug abuse. 

&#160; 

Opioid drugs, such as oxycodone, are an important treatment option for patients with severe chronic pain. However, misuse, abuse and diversion of these prescription drugs remains a serious, persistent problem. Nearly 19,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014, according to the NIH&#8217;s National Institute on Drug Abuse. 

&#160; 

Our lead drug candidate is called REMOXY (oxycodone capsules CII). REMOXY is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent, oral formulation of oxycodone (CII). We developed REMOXY to make oxycodone difficult to abuse yet provide 12 hours of steady pain relief when used appropriately by patients. 

In particular, REMOXY&#8217;s thick, sticky, high viscosity formulation may deter unapproved routes of drug administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking. REMOXY targets the $2.5 billion marketplace for long-acting formulations of oxycodone. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to REMOXY. 

&#160; 

In March 2016, w e plan to submit to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for REMOXY. The REMOXY NDA has priority review status with the FDA. We expect a review cycle of about six months. This is a 505(b)(2) NDA resubmission for five dosage strengths of REMOXY (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 mg) . The drug&#8217;s proposed indication is &#8220; f o r &#160; the &#160; m anag e m ent &#160; of pain severe enough to require daily , &#160; arou n d-the-clock, long-term &#160; opioid trea t m ent and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate &#8221;. The safety and clinical efficacy of REMOXY is supported by multiple studies, including a successful Phase III efficacy program conducted under an FDA Special Protocol Assessment. REMOXY&#8217;s abuse-deterrence is supported by a body of clinical and non-clinical data, including data comparing REMOXY against currently marketed oxycodone products. The NDA will propose label claims that properly characterize REMOXY&#8217;s abuse-deterrent properties, including certain routes 

&#160;

of abuse that REMOXY may deter, such as injection, snorting or smoking. The NDA also includes stability data that we believe meet FDA guidance criteria in support of a 24-month shelf life. 

&#160; 

Use and Abuse of Opioid Drugs 

&#160; 

Opioid drugs are primarily used to relieve pain. They are among the world&#8217;s oldest known drugs. The term &#8216;opioid&#8217; refers to an entire class of analgesic substances that are derived from the opium poppy plant. Drugs that fall within this class include oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, heroin, morphine and many other related substances. 

&#160; 

In recent decades, oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opium derivative, has become a standard of care to treat severe chronic pain. Oxycodone is in Schedule II of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which means it has accepted medical use with severe restrictions, a high potential for abuse and regulations around its manufacture, possession, storage, use and distribution. 

&#160; 

Oxycodone can provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients in pain when used as prescribed. In recent years, patients with severe chronic pain have benefited from oxycodone in long-acting formulations. Long-acting formulations contain a very high dose of oxycodone that is intended to release evenly over 12 hours. Long-acting oxycodone offers the convenience of less-frequent dosing intervals and improved compliance, a potential win-win for prescribers and for patients with severe chronic pain. 

&#160; 

However, the emergence of long-acting oxycodone has also corresponded with a dramatic increase in opioid drug abuse. Drug abuse is the use of opioid drugs for reasons other than what the drug was prescribed for, and often via unapproved routes of administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking. Opioids such as oxycodone are primarily abused due to their ability to produce a strong, if fleeting, euphoric high. 

&#160; 

Drug abusers have learned effective ways to tamper with, and defeat, long-acting oxycodone formulations. Defeating the long-acting properties of an oxycodone formulation can be as easy as crushing or grinding tablets, then swallowing, injecting, snorting or smoking the crushed substance. This releases high levels of oxycodone faster than intended (called &#8220;dose-dumping&#8221;), resulting in an immediate and powerful euphoric high, as compared to swallowing an intact tablet as prescribed. 

&#160; 

Opioid abuse is dangerous. Opioid abuse can lead to drug-seeking behavior, tolerance and physical or psychological dependence. Even a single episode of opioid abuse can also lead to overdose, respiratory depression or death. 

&#160; 

The Role of Abuse-deterrent Formulations 

&#160; 

The FDA and other important policy makers have developed a multi-pronged approach aimed at combating opioid misuse, abuse and addiction. One targeted effort has been to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop ADFs. In April 2015, the FDA issued a final guidance to assist the pharmaceutical industry in developing ADF opioid drug products. 

&#160; 

ADFs attempt to raise the bar on opioid abuse by making it more difficult, longer or aversive to tamper with a long-acting formulation, while recognizing that no drug or drug formulation can be made abuse-proof. In particular, an ADF drug can still be misused and result in overdose simply by ingesting the drug in higher than recommended doses. ADFs are not designed to prevent opioid-induced euphoria. ADF technology aims to decrease the likelihood that a long-acting opioid formulation will dose-dump under conditions of abuse or accidental misuse. By mitigating dose-dumping, the likelihood of overdose and death associated may decrease. 

&#160; 

First-generation ADFs were introduced into the marketplace in 2010. However, the relative weakness of first generation ADFs means opioid abuse continues to be a serious public health issue. Nearly 19,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014 alone, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. According to the FDA, &#8220;for each death [due to narcotic pain relievers], there are an additional ten treatment admissions, 32 emergency department visits and 825 nonmedical users of these drugs.&#8221; (Source: FDA&#8217;s Efforts to Address the Misuse and Abuse of Opioids , 2/6/2013). 

&#160; 

As a pioneer in the design and development of ADFs, we believe a robust design for a novel ADF relies on four basic (and mostly incompatible) objectives: i) safety and clinical efficacy when used as prescribed; ii) abuse-deterrent when abused; (iii) ease of large scale manufacturing; and (iv) novel, non-infringing intellectual property. Many ADF programs may achieve 

&#160;

three of these four objectives but the practical reality is that few ADFs achieve all four. We believe this is reflected in the industry&#8217;s relatively high failure rate with regards to ADFs developments for long-acting opioid formulations. 

&#160; 

About REMOXY (oxycodone capsules CII) 

&#160; 

Our lead drug candidate is called REMOXY. REMOXY is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent, oral formulation of oxycodone (CII). We developed REMOXY to make oxycodone difficult to abuse yet provide 12 hours of steady pain relief when used appropriately by patients. 

&#160; 

REMOXY is intended to meet th e needs of healthcare professionals who appropriately prescribe opioid drugs and who seek to minimize the risks of drug diversion, abuse or accidental patient misuse. In particular, REMOXY&#8217;s thick, sticky, high viscosity formulation may deter unapproved routes of drug administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking. 

&#160; 

We initiated the development of REMOXY over a decade ago, before any formal guidance was in place with regards to regulatory pathways for ADFs. As a result of our pioneering efforts with REMOXY, we have developed a foundation of practical experience with regard to regulatory and development pathways for ADFs. 

&#160; 

The following is a top-line chronology of the development of REMOXY: 

&#160; 

" 

In 2003, we filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for REMOXY with the FDA. 

" 

In 2005, we and King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or King, entered into an exclusive agreement to develop and commercialize REMOXY. 

" 

In 2008, we filed an NDA for REMOXY with the FDA. Later that year, we received a Complete Response Letter over manufacturing issues (specifically, in vitro drug stability). However, the Complete Response Letter did not question REMOXY&#8217;s safety, clinical efficacy, abuse-deterrent properties or use of the reference listed drug. 

" 

In 2009, King assumed sole control and responsibility for REMOXY. 

" 

In 2010, King resubmitted the REMOXY NDA with the FDA. In early 2011, Pfizer acquired King. References to Pfizer include references to Pfizer&#8217;s subsidiary King. 

" 

In 2011, Pfizer received a Complete Response Letter on the REMOXY NDA filed by King. Once again, FDA cited manufacturing issues (specifically, in vitro drug stability). Once again, the Complete Response Letter did not question REMOXY&#8217;s safety, clinical efficacy, abuse-deterrent properties or use of the reference listed drug. 

" 

From 2011-2014, Pfizer conducted fundamental investigations of the REMOXY formulation and its manufacture. As a result, Pfizer modified the REMOXY formulation and conducted successful studies to establish bioequivalence of the current formulation to the original formulation of REMOXY, to generate additional abuse-deterrent data and to provide manufacturing stability. 

" 

In 2014, Pfizer provided us with written notice of termination of its development of REMOXY. We and Pfizer agreed on an orderly transfer of all rights, data, IP, etc. 

" 

In 2015, we and Pfizer concluded the transfer of the REMOXY program. We believe Pfizer has transferred to us its data, materials, capital equipment and other assets related to REMOXY. 

" 

In 2015, we generated additional abuse-deterrent data, continued an on-going stability study and made other preparations necessary to resubmit the NDA for REMOXY with the FDA. 

" 

In 2016, we plan to resubmit the NDA for REMOXY with the FDA. We expect a review cycle of about six months. 

&#160; 

We intend our NDA resubmission to generally follow the detailed REMOXY resubmission strategy that was previously agreed upon by Pfizer and the FDA. The safety and clinical efficacy of REMOXY is supported by multiple studies, including a successful Phase III efficacy program conducted under an FDA Special Protocol Assessment. REMOXY&#8217;s abuse-deterrence is supported by a body of clinical and non-clinical data, including data comparing REMOXY against currently marketed oxycodone products. Our abuse-deterrence studies generally examined the impact of common methods of abuse on the rate of release of oxycodone, especially in the first 0-2 hours of abuse, when abusers expect feelings of a strong euphoric high. The NDA will propose label claims that properly characterize REMOXY&#8217;s abuse-deterrent properties, including certain routes 

&#160;

of abuse that REMOXY may deter, such as injection, snorting or smoking. The NDA also includes stability data that we believe meet FDA guidance criteria in support of a 24-month shelf life. 

&#160; 

REMOXY Commercial Opportunity 

&#160; 

The global opioid market has been estimated by third-parties to be valued at nearly $35 billion in 2015. By geography, North America dominates the market, with about 65% market share, or about $22 billion. By drug, long-acting formulations of oxycodone was about a $2.5 billion market. REMOXY targets the $2.5 billion marketplace for long-acting oxycodone. Despite these impressive commercial figures, we believe opioid abuse remains a serious, persistent problem for physicians and patients alike. 

&#160; 

We own exclusive, worldwide rights to REMOXY. If approved and granted appropriate label claims, we believe REMOXY may have potential to distinguish itself from competitors with: 

&#160; 

&#252; 

best-in-class abuse-deterrent properties; 

&#252; 

true twice-daily dosing; 

&#252; 

minimal food effect; 

&#252; 

lack of generic drug substitution; and 

&#252; 

over 15 years of intellectual property protection. 

&#160; 

C urrently we have no capability to launch or to commercialize our drug products. We continue to review potential launch and commercialization strategies for REMOXY. Options include a potential strategic transaction around all of our drug candidates; a commercial collaboration for REMOXY; or establishing commercial capabilities in-house to launch REMOXY on our own. 

&#160; 

Abuse-deterrent Formulations of Hydromorphone and Oxymorphone 

&#160; 

We believe the technology used in REMOXY is a platform that can be applied to the development of ADFs of hydromorphone and oxymorphone, both Schedule II opioids . We have an IND for each of these two ADF drugs candidates in place with the FDA. We own exclusive, worldwide commercial rights with respect to these drug candidates. 

&#160; 

About FENROCK 

&#160; 

FENROCK is a trade name for our proprietary, &#160; abuse-deterrent pain patch. FENROCK&#8217;s active drug ingredient is fentanyl (CII), a highly addictive opioid drug that is up to 50 times more powerful than morphine. 

&#160; 

Currently marketed transdermal fentanyl patches are typically used to manage severe chronic pain, but are also easily abused and have been blamed for thousands of deaths across the U.S. Fentanyl abuse is dangerous. A single episode of fentanyl abuse can lead to overdose, respiratory depression or death. 

&#160; 

FENROCK is an early-stage drug candidate. Our goal with FENROCK is to make the fentanyl pain patch difficult to abuse yet provide 72 hours of steady pain relief when used appropriately by patients. We developed FENROCK in-house. We are currently working with outside collaborators on the development of a final formulation of FENROCK. We believe a final formulation will enable us to file an IND with the FDA. 

&#160; 

We own exclusive, worldwide rights to FENROCK without royalty or milestone obligations to any third &#160; party. 

&#160; 

About PTI-125 

&#160; 

This small molecule drug candidate offers a promising new approach to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease and other neurological disorders. PTI-125, an oral drug, was designed in-house and characterized by outside collaborators. The science that underlies PTI-125 was initially published in The Journal of Neuroscience (2012-32:9773-9784). 

&#160; 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded us a $1,725,000 innovation grant in September 2015 to further study this early-stage drug candidate. This grant was awarded to us following an in-depth evaluation of PTI-125 for scientific and technical merit by academic, clinical and industry experts in neurological disorders. The NIH grant award enables us to fund 

&#160;

and conduct pre-clinical studies around PTI-125 . We expect results of these on-going studies may enable us to file an IND with the FDA. &#160; 

&#160; 

We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125 without royalty or milestone obligations to any third &#160; party. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

We began developing ADFs over a decade ago. Since then our vision has remained the same: to develop novel ADF technology that can set a gold standard of abuse-deterrence for opioid drugs. We submitted our first IND for an ADF opioid drug candidate in 2003. At that time, the FDA had no formal guidelines for ADFs, the public was generally unaware of opioid abuse and many prescribing physicians underappreciated the abuse potential of opioid drugs. Today, there is widespread public awareness of opioid drug abuse and FDA has issued formal regulatory guidance for the development of ADFs. Consequently, we believe our original vision for REMOXY &#8211; to set a gold standard of abuse-deterrence &#8211; is now within reach. 

&#160; 

Our corporate strategy has changed little over the years: to spend carefully but to keep innovation at the top of our agenda. Elements of our corporate strategy include: 

&#160; 

Focus on Clinical Development Stage Products. We believe this focus will enable us to generate product revenues earlier than if we were focused on early-stage research and discovery activities. 

&#160; 

Retain Significant Rights to Our Drugs. We currently retain worldwide commercialization rights to all of our technology and drug candidates in all markets and indications, including REMOXY. In general, &#160; we intend to independently develop our drug candidates through late-stage clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Outsource Key Functions. We intend to continue to outsource preclinical studies, clinical trials and formulation and manufacturing activities. We believe outsourcing permits significant time savings and allows for more efficient deployment of our resources. 

&#160; 

Pursue In-licensing or Acquisition Opportunities. We intend to evaluate promising drug candidates or technologies to further expand our product pipeline. Our in-licensing strategy consists of evaluating clinical or preclinical stage opportunities in therapeutic areas that can benefit from our core expertise in drug development. Such in-licensing or acquisition opportunities may be in pain management or in other therapeutic areas outside of pain management. We believe this element of our corporate strategy could diversify some of the risks inherent in focusing on a single therapeutic area and could also increase our probability of commercial success. 

&#160; 

We also conduct basic research in collaboration with academic and other partners. Our research and development expenses were $4.9 million in 2013, $7.3 million in 2014 and $9.1 million in 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents covering our products and technology. We consider the overall protection of our patents and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. 

&#160; 

We seek to protect our technology by, among other methods, filing and prosecuting U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with respect to our technology and products and their uses. The focus of our patent strategy is to secure and maintain intellectual property rights to technology for the following categories of our business: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the technology that forms the basis of REMOXY and our other abuse-deterrent drug candidates; 

&#183; 

the technologies related to our pre-clinical product candidates; and 

&#183; 

the manufacture and use of our drug candidates. 

&#160; 

&#160;

However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. We protect our proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain of our contractors. 

&#160; 

We plan to prosecute and defend our patent applications, allowed patents, issued patents and proprietary information. Our competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in large part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property from challenges and to enforce our patent rights against potential infringements. 

Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of corresponding patent applications. Our patents and the patents we license from third parties include the following issued U.S. Patents: 8,168,217; 8,153,152; 8,147,870 ; 8,133,507 ; 8,354,124 ; 8,415,401; 8,420,120 ; 8,974,821; 8,945,614; 8,951,556; and 9,233,160. 

&#160; 

Our issued U.S. patent for REMOXY with the longest patent term extends to 2031. Outside the U.S., our granted patent with the longest patent term for REMOXY extends to 2028. Patents may have their term extended for various reasons including the grant of patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, or supplemental protection certificates, or may have their term shortened for various reasons including by terminal disclaimers. Certain U.S. patent applications and patent applications outside the U.S. are pending. 

&#160; 

In addition, we use a unique and complex process to manufacture REMOXY. We also protect as trade secrets the significant pharmaceutical know-how and detailed knowledge of a complex supply chain to manufacture REMOXY. 

&#160; 

REMOXY &#174; and FENROCK&#8482; are trademarks of Pain Therapeutics, Inc. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prior Agreements with Pfizer 

&#160; 

Between 2005 and 2014, Pfizer paid us a total of approximately $290 million. This includes $155 million in upfront fees, $30 million in milestone payments and $105 million to reimburse expenses we incurred under the Pfizer Agreements. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, Pfizer provided us with written notice of termination of the Pfizer Agreements. We believe Pfizer terminated its development of REMOXY, in part, to focus on its own ADF drug candidate called ALO-02. Pfizer filed an NDA for ALO-02 shortly after informing us of its intention to discontinue REMOXY. Pfizer&#8217;s NDA for ALO-02 is currently under review by the FDA. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we announced that we had resumed sole responsibility for REMOXY under the terms of a letter agreement with Pfizer. The letter agreement was entered into within the scope of the previously disclosed provisions of the Collaboration Agreement between us and Pfizer relating to the return of REMOXY. Pfizer has no further obligations to us. We have no further obligations to Pfizer, except that we will owe Pfizer a one-time payment of $200,000, payable at the time REMOXY is approved by the FDA, related to certain commercial manufacturing equipment we purchased from Pfizer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Formulation Agreement with Durect Corporation 

&#160; 

We have an exclusive, worldwide Development and License Agreement, or the Durect Agreement, with Durect to use a patented controlled-release technology that forms the basis for REMOXY and ADFs of oxymorphone and hydromorphone . In 2015, we returned to Durect rights related to ADFs of hydrocodone. 

&#160; 

We are solely responsible for the clinical development of opioid ADFs under the terms of the Durect Agreement. Durect is responsible for furnishing suitable laboratory facilities, equipment and personnel during pre-clinical phases of development. The performance of pre-clinical activities of a joint responsibility of us and Durect. 

Pursuant to the Durect Agreement, we reimburse Durect&#8217;s expenses and make milestone payments based on the achievement of certain clinical or regulatory milestones. We paid Durect approximately $38.4 million from the inception of the Durect Agreement to December 31, 2015. We could pay up to another $5.6 million under the Durect Agreement following achievement of certain milestones. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are obligated to pay Durect royalties on commercial sales of REMOXY, oxymorphone and hydromorphone . These royalties range from 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales, depending on the volume of sales of licensed products in a given calendar year. 

&#160; 

The Durect Agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed under such agreement or a certain number of years following first commercial sale in such country. Currently, the last to expire patent covered by such agreement expires by 2031. However, such date may be extended by the issuance of any additional patents pursuant to pending patent applications. We can terminate the Durect Agreement with notice to Durect, and we and Durect can terminate such agreement under certain circumstances, including material breach and insolvency. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We outsource formulation, manufacturing and related activities to third-parties. 

&#160; 

Our suppliers must comply with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP , enforced by the FDA and other government agencies such as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA . Our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspection by regulators, including pre-approval inspections by the FDA and the DEA, to ensure they are in strict compliance with government regulations and standards. Our suppliers may be forced to stop producing, storing, shipping or testing our drug products if they fall out of compliance with government regulations and standards. 

&#160; 

We have no control over our suppliers&#8217; compliance, or lack thereof, with the multitude of regulations and standards that affect our drug products. We cannot control decisions by our suppliers that affect their ability or willingness to continue to supply us on acceptable terms, or at all. &#160; 

&#160; 

We may not be able to replace a commercial supplier on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Replacing any of our commercial suppliers would be expensive and time consuming. Further, if REMOXY is approved, our commercial suppliers may encounter difficulties in achieving high volumes of production to satisfy commercial demands. Failure by any of our suppliers to perform as expected could delay or prevent commercialization of REMOXY or result in shortages, cost overruns, or other problems and would materially harm our business. 

&#160; 

Commercial supply of certain excipients from Durect 

&#160; 

We will rely on Durect as the sole source of certain excipients in REMOXY. Durect has limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products and maintaining GMP-compliant operations. A Pre-Approval Inspection, or PAI, by FDA officials is often integral to the FDA approval process. A PAI is an unannounced evaluation of a manufacturing or test site for readiness for commercial scale manufacturing, conformance with commitments made in an NDA and data integrity. We do not and cannot know whether Durect&#8217;s manufacturing or test facilities could pass a PAI inspection related to REMOXY. 

&#160; 

We rely on Durect to supply to us certain excipients for the REMOXY formulation. Under the Durect Agreement, these excipients are supplied to us at Durect&#8217;s cost, plus thirty (30) percent. We currently do not have a long-term commercial supply agreement in place with Durect. We expect that we and Durect will negotiate a supply agreement for these excipients. We may not be able to establish a commercial supply agreement on acceptable terms. Until a commercial supply agreement is in place with Durect, we expect to obtain excipients from Durect via individual purchase orders. 

&#160; 

If we receive marketing approval for REMOXY, Durect may need to materially expand its manufacturing capacity. Durect may not be able to increase its manufacturing capacity for REMOXY in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Moreover, significant scale up of manufacturing will require additional validation studies, which are subject to FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

C ommercial supply of oxycodone with Noramco 

&#160; 

We expect to rely on Noramco as the sole source of the oxycodone base used in REMOXY. We currently do not have a long-term commercial supply agreement in place with Noramco. We expect to negotiate with Noramco a commercial supply 

&#160;

agreement to supply us with oxycodone base. We may not be able to establish a commercial supply agreement on acceptable terms, or at all. Until we have a commercial supply agreement in place with Noramco, we expect to obtain oxycodone base from Noramco via individual purchase orders. 

&#160; 

C ommercial drug supply agreement with Mallinckrodt 

&#160; 

We expect to rely on Mallinckrodt as the sole-source drug product manufacturer of REMOXY pursuant to an Amended and Restated Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Mallinckrodt Agreement. Pfizer and Mallinckrodt established the Mallinckrodt Agreement when Pfizer was responsible for commercialization of REMOXY. Pfizer assigned the Mallinckrodt Agreement to us in connection with the termination of the Pfizer Agreements. &#160; In addition to drug product manufacturing, Mallinckrodt is responsible for sourcing excipients in REMOXY other than those provided by the Durect Agreement. We plan to have Mallinckrodt manufacture pre-validation and commercial validation batches of REMOXY in 2016. 

&#160; 

Other commercial manufacturing and supply agreements 

&#160; 

We will rely on third-parties to conduct certain quality control and assurance testing, shipping or storage of REMOXY. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and development activities. All of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, various federal, and in some cases state, statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of our products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require us to spend substantial resources. Regulatory approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products that may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. 

&#160; 

Applicable FDA regulations require the filing of an NDA or a Biologic License Application, or BLA and approval by the FDA prior to commercialization of any of our drug candidates in the United States. 

&#160; 

The Drug Approval Process 

&#160; 

We will be required to complete several activities before we can market any of our drug candidates for human use in the United States, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

preclinical studies; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; 

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; and 

&#183; 

FDA approval of the NDA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug. 

&#160; 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety of the product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practice. We submitted the results of preclinical tests to the FDA as part of our INDs prior to commencing clinical trials. We may be required to conduct additional toxicology studies. 

&#160; 

Based on preclinical testing, an IND is filed with the FDA to begin human testing of the drug in the United States. The IND becomes effective if not rejected by the FDA within 30 days. The IND must indicate the results of previous experiments, how, where and by whom the new clinical trials will be conducted, the chemical structure of the compound, the method by which it is believed to work in the human body, any toxic effects of the compound found in the animal studies and how the compound is manufactured. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. In addition, an 

&#160;

Institutional Review Board, or IRB, generally comprised of physicians at the hospital or clinic where the proposed clinical trials will be conducted, must review and approve the IND. The IRB also continues to monitor the clinical trial. We must submit progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials to the FDA at least annually. In addition, the FDA may, at any time during the 30-day period or at any time thereafter, impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials under the IND cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. An FDA imposed clinical hold on an IND application can result in substantial delay and large, unforeseen expenses, and it may cancel the viability of developing a new drug candidate in the United States. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase I clinical trials typically study a drug&#8217;s safety profile, and may include the safe dosage range. Phase I clinical trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and the duration of its action. In addition, we may, to the extent feasible, assess early indicators of a drug&#8217;s efficacy in our Phase I clinical trials. In Phase II clinical trials, controlled studies are conducted on volunteer patients with the targeted disease or condition. The primary purpose of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on the volunteer patients as well as to determine a drug&#8217;s side effect profile. These clinical trials may be conducted concurrently with Phase I clinical trials. In addition, Phase I/II clinical trials may be conducted to evaluate not only the efficacy of the drug on the patient population, but also its safety. During Phase III clinical trials, the drug is studied in an expanded patient population and in multiple sites. Physicians monitor the patients to determine efficacy and to observe and report adverse events that may result from use of the drug. 

&#160; 

Our clinical trials are designed to produce clinical information about how our drugs perform compared to placebo or compared to existing drugs where appropriate. We have designed most Phase II and Phase III clinical trials to date as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies. A randomized clinical trial is one in which patients are randomly assigned to the various study treatment arms. A double-blind clinical trial is one in which the patient, the physician and our trial monitor are unaware if the patient is receiving placebo or study drug in order to preserve the integrity of the clinical trial and reduce bias. A placebo-controlled clinical trial is one in which a subset of patients is purposefully given inactive medication. 

&#160; 

We may not successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III clinical trials within any specified time period, or at all, with respect to any of our drug candidates. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time in response to concerns that participants are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

After the completion of clinical trials, if there is substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA is filed with the FDA. The NDA must contain all of the information on the drug gathered to that date, including data from the clinical trials. NDAs often exceed 100,000 pages in length. 

&#160; 

The FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA. In such an event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and, again, is subject to review before filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA reviews the NDA and responds to the applicant. The review process is typically extended for significant amounts of time by the FDA&#8217;s requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 

&#160; 

If the FDA&#8217;s evaluations of the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue either a Complete Response Letter indicating either an approval or may identify conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA or issue a not approvable letter. 

&#160; 

If the FDA approves the NDA, the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe. Periodic reports must be submitted to the FDA, including descriptions of any reported adverse reactions. The FDA may request additional post-marketing studies, or Phase IV clinical trials, to evaluate long-term effects of the approved drug. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured in conformity with current GMP. If the FDA approves any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to requirements for labeling, advertising, record keeping and adverse experience reporting. Failure to comply with these requirements could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, injunctions or civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, and import, export, and customs regulations. In addition, any of our products that contain narcotics will be subject to DEA regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescribing procedures. It is possible that any portion of the regulatory framework under which we operate may change and that such change could have a negative impact on our current and anticipated operations. 

&#160; 

The Controlled Substances Act imposes various registration, record-keeping and reporting requirements, procurement and manufacturing quotas, labeling and packaging requirements, security controls and a restriction on prescription refills on certain pharmaceutical products. A principal factor in determining the particular requirements, if any, applicable to a product is its actual or potential abuse profile. The DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Any of our drug candidates that contain a scheduled substance will be subject to regulation by the DEA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to achieve market share at the expense of existing and established and future products in the relevant target markets. Existing and future products, therapies, technological approaches or delivery systems will compete directly with our products. Competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific indication, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. Companies that currently sell generic or proprietary opioid formulations may include, but are not limited to, Roxane Laboratories, Purdue Pharma, Mylan, Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Elkins-Sinn, Watson Laboratories, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical and Forest Pharmaceuticals. Collegium Pharmaceuticals may in the future commercialize an abuse-deterrent oxycodone formulation. Pfizer&#8217;s NDA for ALO-02, an abuse-deterrent oxycodone formulation, is currently under review by the FDA. Alternative technologies are being developed to address the issue of abuse or misuse of opioid painkillers or increase opioid potency, as well as alternatives to opioid therapy for pain management, several of which are in clinical trials or are awaiting approval from the FDA. 

&#160; 

We compete with fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have opioid drugs already approved by the FDA or in development and operate larger research and development programs in these fields than we do. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

developing drugs; 

&#183; 

undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials; 

&#183; 

obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs; &#160; 

&#183; 

formulating and manufacturing drugs; and 

&#183; 

launching, marketing, distributing and selling drugs. 

&#160; 

Developments by competitors may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. We also compete with these companies for qualified personnel and opportunities for product acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.
