 Item 1. Business . 

&#160; 

Air T, Inc. (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Air T,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a decentralized holding company with ownership interests in a broad set of operating and financial assets that are designed to expand, strengthen and diversify our cash earnings power. Our goal is to build on Air T&#8217;s core businesses, to expand into adjacent industries, and when appropriate, to acquire companies that we believe fit into the Air T family. 

&#160; 

We currently operate wholly owned subsidiaries in three core industry segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

overnight air cargo, comprised of our Mountain Air Cargo, Inc. (&#8220;MAC&#8221;) and CSA Air, Inc. (&#8220;CSA&#8221;) subsidiaries, which operates in the air express delivery services industry; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

ground equipment sales, comprised of our Global Ground Support, LLC (&#8220;GGS&#8221;) subsidiary, which manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military and industrial customers; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

ground support services, comprised of our Global Aviation Services, LLC (&#8220;GAS&#8221;) subsidiary, which provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers. 

&#160; 

We recently added two other businesses, which are reported in separate segments. In October 2015, we formed a wholly owned equipment leasing subsidiary, Air T Global Leasing, LLC (&#8220;ATGL&#8221;), which comprises our leasing segment, and in November 2015 we acquired a minority interest in Delphax Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Delphax&#8221;), a printing equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider, which comprises our printing equipment and maintenance segment. 

&#160; 

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the overnight air cargo segment accounted for 46% of our consolidated revenues, the ground equipment sales segment accounted for 34% of our consolidated revenues, the ground support services segment accounted for 17% of consolidated revenues, while the leasing segment and printing equipment and maintenance segment accounted for less than 1% and 3%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Certain financial data with respect to the Company&#8217;s segments and geographic areas are set forth in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

&#160; 

Air T was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1980. The principal place of business of Air T, MAC and ATGL is 3524 Airport Road, Maiden, North Carolina; the principal place of business of CSA is Iron Mountain, Michigan, the principal place of business for GGS is Olathe, Kansas, the principal place of business for GAS is Eagan, Minnesota and the principal place of business of Delphax is Minneapolis, Minnesota. We maintain an Internet website at http://www.airt.net and our SEC filings may be accessed through links on our website. 

&#160; 

Overnight Air Cargo. 

&#160; 

MAC and CSA are two of seven companies in the U.S. that have North American feeder airlines under contract with FedEx. With a relationship with FedEx spanning over 35 years, MAC and CSA operate and maintain Cessna Caravan, ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft that fly daily small-package cargo routes throughout the eastern United States, upper Midwest and the Caribbean. MAC and CSA&#8217;s revenues are derived principally pursuant to &#8220;dry-lease&#8221; service contracts with FedEx. On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx which together cover all of the revenue aircraft operated by MAC and CSA and replace all prior dry-lease service contracts. These dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by MAC and CSA in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate. These new dry-lease agreements provide that FedEx determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made by MAC and CSA, respectively. The new dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of MAC and CSA&#8217;s costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Unlike prior dry-lease contracts, under the new dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by MAC and CSA in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by MAC and CSA. Under the new dry-lease agreements, MAC and CSA are required to perform maintenance of the leased aircraft in return for a maintenance fee based upon an hourly maintenance labor rate, which has been increased from the rate in place under the prior dry-lease service contracts. Under prior dry-lease service contracts, the hourly maintenance labor rate had not been adjusted since 2008. The new dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to MAC and CSA of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated. The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the new dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and the fact that certain operational costs borne by MAC and CSA are not reimbursed. The amount of the administrative fee is subject to adjustment based on the number of aircraft operated, routes flown and whether aircraft are considered to be soft-parked. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The new dry-lease agreements would expire, unless renewed, on May 31, 2020. The new dry-lease agreements may be terminated by FedEx or MAC and CSA, respectively, at any time upon 90 days&#8217; written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days&#8217; written notice. In addition, each of the dry-lease agreements provides that FedEx may terminate the agreement upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA&#8217;s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes MAC or CSA&#8217;s only customer, or MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would have been permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The Company believes that the short-term nature of its agreements with FedEx is standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry, where performance is measured on a daily basis. 

&#160; 

Under the dry-lease service contracts in place during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the first two months of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, FedEx leased its aircraft to MAC and CSA for a nominal amount and paid a monthly administrative fee to MAC and CSA to operate the aircraft. Under these contracts, all direct costs related to the operation of the aircraft (including fuel, outside maintenance, landing fees and pilot costs) were passed through to FedEx without markup. 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, MAC and CSA had an aggregate of 78 aircraft under the dry-lease agreements with FedEx. Included within the 78 aircraft are 3 Cessna Caravan aircraft that are considered soft-parked. Soft-parked aircraft remain covered under MAC and CSA&#8217;s agreements with FedEx although at a reduced administrative fee compared to aircraft that are in operation. MAC and CSA continue to perform maintenance on soft-parked aircraft, but they are not crewed and MAC and CSA do not operate soft-parked aircraft on scheduled routes. 

&#160; 

Revenues from MAC and CSA&#8217;s contracts with FedEx accounted for approximately 46% and 45% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of FedEx as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. MAC and CSA are not contractually precluded from providing services to other parties and MAC occasionally provides third-party maintenance services to other airline customers and the U.S. military. 

&#160; 

MAC and CSA operate under separate aviation certifications. MAC is certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (the &#8220;FAA&#8221;). These certifications permit MAC to operate and maintain aircraft that can carry a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds on the Cessna Caravan 208B under Part 135 and a maximum cargo capacity of 14,000 pounds for the ATR-42 and 17,800 pounds for the ATR-72 aircraft under Part 121. CSA is certified to operate and maintain aircraft under Part 135 of the FAA regulations. This certification permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

MAC and CSA, together, operated the following FedEx-owned cargo aircraft as of March 31, 2016: 

&#160;

The Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (&#8220;AAIP&#8221;). The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours. The current overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 8,000 hours. 

&#160; 

The ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 maintenance program. The program consists of A and C service checks as well as calendar checks ranging from weekly to 12 years in duration. The engine overhaul period is &#8220;on condition&#8221;. 

&#160; 

MAC and CSA operate in a niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market. MAC and CSA are two of seven carriers that operate within the United States as FedEx feeder carriers. MAC and CSA are benchmarked against the other five FedEx feeders based on safety, reliability, compliance with federal, state and applicable foreign regulations, price and other service related measurements. Accurate industry data is not available to indicate the Company&#8217;s position within its marketplace (in large measure because all of the Company&#8217;s direct competitors are privately held), but management believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute the largest contract carrier of the type described immediately above. 

&#160; 

FedEx conducts periodic audits of MAC and CSA, and these audits are an integral part of the relationship between the carrier and FedEx. The audits test adherence to the dry-lease agreements and assess the carrier&#8217;s overall internal control environment, particularly as related to the processing of invoices of FedEx-reimbursable costs. The scope of these audits typically extends beyond simple validation of invoice data against the third-party supporting documentation. The audit teams generally investigate the operator&#8217;s processes and procedures for strong internal control procedures. The Company believes satisfactory audit results are critical to maintaining its relationship with FedEx. The audits conducted by FedEx are not designed to provide any assurance with respect to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, and investors, in evaluating the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, should not rely in any way on any such examination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s overnight air cargo operations are not materially seasonal. 

&#160; 

Ground Equipment Sales. 

&#160; 

GGS is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment sold to domestic and international passenger and cargo airlines, ground handling companies, the United States Air Force (&#8220;USAF&#8221;), airports and industrial customers. GGS&#8217;s product line includes aircraft deicers, scissor-type lifts, military and civilian decontamination units, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other specialized equipment. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, sales of deicing equipment accounted for approximately 82% of GGS&#8217;s revenues, compared to 72% in the prior fiscal year. 

&#160; 

GGS designs and engineers its products. Components acquired from third-party suppliers are used in the assembly of its finished products. Components are sourced from a diverse supply chain. The primary components for mobile deicing equipment are the chassis (which is a commercial medium or heavy-duty truck), fluid storage tank, a boom system, fluid delivery system and heating equipment. The price of these components is influenced by raw material costs, principally high-strength carbon steels and stainless steel. GGS utilizes continuous improvements and other techniques to improve efficiencies and designs to minimize product price increases to its customers, to respond to regulatory changes, such as emission standards, and to incorporate technological improvements to enhance the efficiency of GGS&#8217;s products. Improvements have included the development of single operator mobile deicing units to replace units requiring two operators, a patented premium deicing blend system and a more efficient forced-air deicing system. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

GGS manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from 700 to 2,800 gallons. GGS also offers fixed-pedestal-mounted deicers. Each model can be customized as requested by the customer, including single operator configuration, fire suppressant equipment, open basket or enclosed cab design, a patented forced-air deicing nozzle, on-board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage, and color and style of the exterior finish. GGS also manufactures five models of scissor-lift equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft, and has developed a line of decontamination equipment, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment. 

&#160; 

GGS competes primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of its products, prompt delivery, service and price. The market for aviation ground service equipment is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry, weather patterns and changes in technology. 

&#160; 

GGS&#8217;s mobile deicing equipment business has historically been seasonal, with revenues typically being lower in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. The Company has continued its efforts to reduce GGS&#8217;s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its international and domestic customer base and its product line. In July 2009, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF, which expired in July 2014. On May 15, 2014, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF. The initial contract award is for two years through July 13, 2016 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF. The value of the contract, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends upon annual requirements and available funding to the USAF. 

&#160; 

Although GGS has retained the USAF deicer contract, GGS sold no deicer units to the USAF under this contract during fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. As a result, GGS revenues and operating income have resumed their seasonal pattern. At March 31, 2016, GGS had received an order for the pre-production unit for the GL1800 model deicer under this contract, and that unit is included in backlog with completion scheduled during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Delivery and acceptance of the pre-production unit is typically required by the USAF before further orders are submitted. 

&#160; 

In September 2010, GGS was awarded a contract to supply flight-line tow tractors to the USAF. The contract award was for one year commencing September 28, 2010 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF. All option periods under the contract have been exercised and the contract expired in September 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, GGS revenues included $708,000 of flight-line tow tractor sales to the USAF under this contract ($2,883,000 for the year ended March 31, 2015). 

&#160; 

Because the USAF is not obligated to purchase a set or minimum number of units under these contracts, the value of these contracts, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends upon the USAF&#8217;s requirements and available funding. GGS&#8217;s revenue from sales to the USAF, including under these contracts and for parts for units sold under prior contracts, accounted for approximately 3% and 14% of the segment&#8217;s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Ground Support Services. 

&#160; 

GAS, which was started by the Company in September 2007, provides aircraft ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services. At March 31, 2016, GAS was providing ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services to more than 75 customers at 67 North American airports. 

&#160; 

Approximately 33% and 36%, respectively, of GAS&#8217;s revenues in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, were derived from services under contract with LSG SkyChefs. The LSG SkyChefs contract extends to August 31, 2018, and includes a 30-day termination clause for either party. In addition, approximately 15% of GAS&#8217;s revenues in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, were derived from services under contract with Delta Airlines. 

&#160; 

GAS competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and pricing of its services. The market for ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry. GAS&#8217;s maintenance service business is not materially seasonal. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Printing Equipment and Maintenance. &#160; 

&#160; 

On November 24, 2015, the Company purchased (i) at face value a $2,500,000 principal amount Five-Year Senior Subordinated Promissory Note (the &#8220;Senior Subordinated Note&#8221;) issued by Delphax&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary for a combination of cash and the surrender of outstanding principal of $500,000 and accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, and cancellation of, a 90-Day Senior Subordinated Note purchased at face value by the Company from that Delphax subsidiary on October 2, 2015 and (ii) for $1,050,000 in cash a total of 43,000 shares (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of Delphax&#8217;s Series B Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;) and a Stock Purchase Warrant (the &#8220;Warrant&#8221;) to acquire an additional 95,600 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a price of $33.4728 per share (subject to adjustment for specified dilutive events). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of common stock of Delphax, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Based on the number of shares of Delphax common stock outstanding and reserved for issuance under Delphax&#8217;s employee stock option plans, at March 31, 2016 the number of shares of common stock underlying the Shares represent approximately 38% of the shares of Delphax common stock that would be outstanding assuming conversion of the Shares and approximately 31% of the outstanding shares assuming conversion of the Shares and the issuance of all the shares of Delphax common stock reserved for issuance under Delphax&#8217;s employee stock option plans. Under the agreement that provided for the Company&#8217;s purchase of these interests, on November 24, 2015 three designees of the Company (including Nick Swenson, the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Michael Moore, the President of our GGS subsidiary) were elected to the board of directors of Delphax, which had a total of seven members following their election. Pursuant to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, for so long as amounts are owed to Air T under the Senior Subordinated Note or we continue to hold a specified number of the Shares and interests in the Warrant holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, the Company would be entitled to elect, after June 1, 2016, four-sevenths of the members of the board of directors of Delphax and, without the written consent or waiver of the Company, Delphax may not enter into specified corporate transactions. As a result of these transactions, we determined that, even though Delphax was not a subsidiary of the Company, we had obtained control over Delphax in conjunction with the acquisition of the interests described above, and we have consolidated the relevant financial information of Delphax in Air T&#8217;s consolidated financial statements beginning on November 24, 2015. Delphax&#8217;s revenues from the date of our investments through March 31, 2016 were approximately $3,955,000. 

&#160; 

Delphax designs, manufactures and sells advanced digital print production equipment (including high-speed, high-volume cut-sheet and continuous roll-fed printers), maintenance contracts, spare parts, supplies and consumable items for these systems. The equipment is sold through Delphax and its subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom and France. A significant portion of Delphax&#8217;s net sales has historically been related to service and support provided after the sale, including the sale of consumable items for installed printing systems. Historically, Delphax has had a significant presence in the check production marketplace in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. Delphax&#8217;s primary manufacturing facility, operated by its Canadian subsidiary, is located in Mississauga, Ontario. Delphax&#8217;s common stock is traded on the over-the-counter market under the symbol &#8220;DLPX.&#8221; &#160; 

&#160;

Our investments in Delphax were intended to support the commercial rollout and manufacturing costs of the new Delphax elan&#8482; 500 digital color print system, which combines advances in inkjet and paper-handling technologies in a production class sheet-fed system offering full CMYK color and 1600 dpi print quality at speeds of up to 500 letter impressions per minute. &#160; Delphax&#8217;s legacy consumables production business was expected to generate cash flow while Delphax rolled-out its next generation &#233;lan commercial inkjet printer. In April 2016, Delphax received notice from its largest (approximately 50% of legacy revenues) customer that it planned to reduce its order volume by approximately 90%; and phase out its use of the legacy Delphax printers within eighteen months. Accordingly, Delphax is reviewing its fiscal year 2016 operating plan and has engaged an experienced turn-around consultant &#8212; the Platinum Group &#8212; to assist it in developing a go-forward plan. The decline in order volumes from its largest customer is expected to significantly impact Delphax&#8217;s results for the quarter ending June 30, 2016. 

&#160;

On April 4, 2016, ATGL purchased two elan&#8482; 500 printers from Delphax for $650,000 for lease to a third party. One of those acquired printers was subject to an existing lease to a third party which has been assigned to ATGL. 

&#160; 

Leasing . 

&#160; 

We organized ATGL on October 6, 2015. ATGL provides funding for equipment leasing transactions, which may include transactions for the leasing of equipment manufactured by GGS and Delphax and transactions initiated by third parties unrelated to equipment manufactured by us. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, ATGL contributed $20,000 to our consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Backlog. 

&#160; 

GGS&#8217;s backlog consists of &#8220;firm&#8221; orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment sold by GGS. At March 31, 2016, GGS&#8217;s backlog of orders was $10.0 million, all of which GGS expects to be filled in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2015, GGS&#8217;s backlog of orders was $2.8 million. In addition, at March 31, 2016, Delphax&#8217;s backlog of &#8220;firm&#8221; orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment, goods and services that it sells was $0.8 million, all of which it expects to fill by March 31, 2017. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation. 

&#160; 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies. 

&#160; 

The Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) has the authority to regulate air service. The DOT has authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, and may, in certain circumstances, assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions. 

&#160; 

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires MAC and CSA to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. 

&#160; 

The Federal Aviation Administration has safety jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including flight equipment, flight and ground personnel training, examination and certification, certain ground facilities, flight equipment maintenance programs and procedures, examination and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic control and communications and other matters. The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of flight operations generally, including equipment used, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds all operating airworthiness and other FAA certificates that are currently required for the conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked for cause. The FAA periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA&#8217;s operating procedures and flight and maintenance records. 

&#160; 

In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including MAC and CSA, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carriers from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us. 

&#160; 

The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. The aircraft operated by the Company are in compliance with all such regulations promulgated by the FAA. Moreover, because the Company does not operate jet aircraft, noncompliance is not likely. Aircraft operated by us also comply with standards for aircraft exhaust emissions promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. 

&#160; 

Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Maintenance and Insurance. 

&#160; 

The Company, through its subsidiaries, is required to maintain the aircraft it operates under the appropriate FAA and manufacturer standards and regulations. 

&#160; 

The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance in excess of minimum amounts required by the United States Department of Transportation. 

&#160; 

The Company maintains cargo liability insurance, workers&#8217; compensation insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance for owned and leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance with respect to injuries and loss arising from use of products sold and services provided. 

&#160; 

In March 2014, the Company formed Space Age Insurance Company (&#8220;SAIC&#8221;), a captive insurance company licensed in Utah. SAIC insures risks of the Company and its subsidiaries that were not previously insured by the various Company insurance programs (including the risk of loss of key customers and contacts, administrative actions and regulatory changes); and underwrites third-party risk through certain reinsurance arrangements. The activities of SAIC are included within the corporate results in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Employees. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 600 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees. This does not include employees of Delphax, which is not a subsidiary of the Company. None of the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are represented by labor unions. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good. 

&#160;
