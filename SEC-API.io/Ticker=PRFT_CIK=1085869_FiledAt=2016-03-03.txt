 Item 1. Business.

Overview

Perficient is a leading digital transformation consulting firm serving Global 2000&#174; and enterprise customers throughout North America. With a broad array of information technology, management consulting, and creative capabilities, Perficient delivers vision, execution, and value with outstanding digital experience, business optimization, and industry solutions. Our work enables clients to improve productivity and competitiveness; grow and strengthen relationships with customers, suppliers and partners; and reduce costs. Our solutions include big data and analytics, technology platform implementations, commerce, enterprise content management, portals and collaboration, management consulting, custom applications, business integration, business process management, and customer relationship management, among others. Our solutions enable our clients to operate a real-time enterprise that dynamically adapts business processes and the systems that support them to meet the changing demands of a global, Internet-driven and competitive marketplace.

Through our experience in developing and delivering solutions for our clients, we believe we have acquired domain expertise that differentiates our firm. We use project teams that deliver high-value, measurable results by working collaboratively with clients and their partners through a user-centered, technology-based and business-driven solutions methodology. We believe this approach enhances return-on-investment for our clients by reducing the time and risk associated with designing and implementing technology solutions.

We serve our clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America by leveraging a sales team that is experienced and connected through a common service portfolio, sales process, and performance management system. Our sales process utilizes project pursuit teams that include those of our information technology colleagues best suited to address a particular prospective client's needs. Our primary target client base includes companies in North America with annual revenues in excess of $500 million. We believe this market segment can generate the repeat business that is a fundamental part of our growth plan. We primarily pursue solutions opportunities where our domain expertise and delivery track record give us a competitive advantage.

During 2015, we continued to implement a strategy focused on: expanding our relationships with existing and new clients; continuing to make disciplined acquisitions by acquiring substantially all of the assets of Zeon Solutions Incorporated, a Wisconsin corporation, Grand River Interactive LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, and their Indian affiliate, Zeon Solutions Private Limited (collectively, " Zeon " ) in January, all of the outstanding stock of Market Street Solutions, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ( " Market Street " ), in September, and substantially all of the assets of The Pup Group, Inc., a Michigan corporation doing business as Enlighten ("Enlighten"), in December; expanding our technical skill and geographic base by expanding our business both organically and through acquisitions; expanding our brand visibility among prospective clients, employees, and software vendors; leveraging our offshore capabilities in China and India; and leveraging our existing (and pursuing new) strategic alliances by targeting leading business advisory companies and technology providers. Approximately 98% of our revenues were derived from clients in the United States during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 99% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Approximately 94%, 96% and 97% of our total assets were located in the United States as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with the remainder located in China, Canada, the United Kingdom and India. 

We have been able to extend or enhance our presence in certain markets through acquisitions, as well as expand or enhance the services and solutions we are able to provide our clients. Our acquisition of Zeon on January 2, 2015 enabled us to broaden and deepen our ecommerce expertise and expand into the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Ann Arbor, Michigan markets and to leverage the acquired development center in Nagpur, India . Our acquisition of Market Street strengthens our analytics capabilities and adds a market location in Tennessee and strengthens the Company's southeastern U.S. presence. Our acquisition of Enlighten enhances and expands the Company's digital strategy, creative services and marketing expertise. 

We provide services primarily to the healthcare (including pharma and life sciences), financial services (including banking and insurance), retail and consumer goods, automotive and transport products, electronics and computer hardware, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and utilities, business services, and leisure, and media and entertainment markets, among others.

Our Solutions

We help clients gain competitive advantage by using technology to: make their businesses more responsive to market opportunities; strengthen relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners; improve productivity; and reduce information technology costs. Our digital experience, business optimization and industry solutions enable these benefits by developing, integrating, automating, and extending business processes, technology infrastructure and software applications end-to-end within an organization and with key partners, suppliers, and customers. This provides real-time access to critical business applications and information and a scalable, reliable, secure, and cost-effective technology infrastructure that enables clients to:

&#183;

give managers and executives the information they need to make quality business decisions and dynamically adapt their business processes and systems to respond to client demands, market opportunities, or business problems;

&#183;

improve the quality and lower the cost of customer acquisition and care through web-based customer self-service and provisioning;

&#183;

reduce supply chain costs and improve logistics by flexibly and quickly integrating processes and systems and making relevant real-time information and applications available online to suppliers, partners, and distributors;

&#183;

increase the effectiveness and value of legacy enterprise technology infrastructure investments by enabling faster application development and deployment, increased flexibility, and lower management costs; and

&#183;

increase employee productivity through better information flow and collaboration capabilities and by automating routine processes to enable focus on unique problems and opportunities.

Our broad spectrum of digital experience and business optimization solutions include the following:

&#183;

Big Data and Analytics . We design, develop, and implement business analytics solutions that allow companies to interpret and act upon accurate, timely, and integrated information. Business analytics solutions help our clients make more informed business decisions by classifying, aggregating, and correlating data into meaningful business information. Our business analytics solutions allow our clients to transform data into knowledge for quick and effective decision making and can include information strategy, data warehousing, and business analytics and reporting.

&#160;

&#183;

Platform Implementations . We design, develop, and implement technology platform solutions that allow our clients to establish a robust, reliable Internet-based infrastructure for integrated business applications which extend enterprise technology assets to employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. Our platform services include application server selection, architecture planning, installation and configuration, clustering for availability, performance assessment and issue remediation, security services, and technology migrations.

&#183;

Content Management ("CM") . We design, develop, and implement CM solutions that enable the management of all unstructured information regardless of file type or format. Our CM solutions can facilitate the creation of new content and/or provide easy access and retrieval of existing digital assets from other enterprise tools such as enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, or legacy applications.

&#183;

Portals and Collaboration . We design, develop, implement, and integrate secure and scalable enterprise portals and collaboration solutions for our clients and their customers, employees, suppliers, partners, members, patients and others. These include searchable data systems, collaborative systems for process improvement, transaction processing, unified and extended reporting, commerce, content management and more. Our award-winning work includes multiple portal types built on many vendor platforms and features integration with a variety of technologies, social capabilities, and mobile sites.

&#183;

Cloud Services . Agility, innovation, and rapid time-to-market are critical to maintaining competitive advantage and seizing market opportunities, and cloud computing has emerged as perhaps the key enabler for business efficiency and agility. We help clients leverage cloud technologies from strategy through implementation for maximum business value with cloud services that include: architecture, assessments (business value and health checks), strategy and road maps, and vendor evaluation and selection.

&#183;

Enterprise Social . Enterprise social networks allow organizations to dismantle the artificial borders of geography, organizational dynamics, and distinct business units, and connect employees to information, documents, and one another in a conversational, easy-to-use format. We help clients break down these borders with enterprise social solutions that include: ideation and crowdsourcing, mobile apps, employee onboarding, partner and vendor collaboration, user and customer support, expert location/Q&#38;A, and much more.

&#183;

Digital Marketing . We leverage client insights and analytical customer data to deliver exceptional results that allow our clients to stay ahead of the competition and to remain at the forefront of everything related to digital marketing. Our expertise includes: search engine marketing (including search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising), user experience and design, and conversion rate optimization.

&#160;

&#183;

Custom Applications . We design, develop, implement, and integrate custom application solutions that deliver enterprise-specific functionality to meet the unique requirements and needs of our clients. Our substantial experience with platforms including J2EE, .NET, and Open-source enables enterprises of all types to leverage cutting-edge technologies to meet business-driven needs.

&#183;

Business Integration . We help clients integrate fragmented, non-integrated systems and processes with a coherent architecture on which to rationalize and modernize legacy systems, automate and optimize business processes, and improve data quality and accessibility. We specialize in service-oriented architecture, application program interfaces ("API"), business process management, event-driven architecture, complex event processing, master data management, and enterprise application integration, often using these technologies together to modernize legacy application architecture and support multi-channel user experiences such as portals, B2B APIs, social media and mobility applications.

&#183;

Business Process Management ("BPM") . BPM combines people, process and technology to improve organizational performance and customer value. We design, develop, and implement BPM solutions that allow our clients to quickly adapt their business processes to respond to new market opportunities or competitive threats by taking advantage of business strategies supported by flexible business applications and information technology infrastructures.

&#160;

&#183;

Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") . We design, develop, and implement advanced CRM solutions that facilitate customer acquisition, service and support, and sales and marketing by understanding our clients' needs through interviews, requirements-gathering sessions, call center analysis, developing an iterative prototype driven solution, and integrating the solution to legacy processes and applications.

We conceive, build, and implement these solutions through a comprehensive set of services including business strategy, user-centered design, systems architecture, custom application development, technology integration, package implementation, and managed services.

We have developed intellectual property assets, applications, utilities and products, that enable our clients to speed time to delivery and reduce total cost of ownership. In addition, we also sell certain internally developed software packages. These foundational tools include configurable Solution Accelerators and Industry Tools that can be customized to solve specific enterprise challenges. Our Solution Accelerators increase the velocity of solution development across key horizontal disciplines including integration and API's, content management, business process management, enterprise search and tax compliance. Our Industry Tools enable enterprises to address industry-specific business process and workflow challenges. We offer tools for the healthcare, energy and utilities, financial services and retail markets. Our strong network of partnerships and cross-platform capabilities enable us to develop and deliver accelerators across a wide spectrum of solution areas and vendor platforms.

In addition to our technology solution services and intellectual property assets, we offer education and mentoring services to our clients. We conduct IBM and Oracle-certified training, where we provide our clients both a customized and established curriculum of courses and other education services.

Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths include:

&#183;

Domain Expertise . We have acquired significant domain expertise in a core set of technology solutions and software platforms. These solutions include big data and analytics, technology platform implementations, commerce, enterprise content management, portals and collaboration, management consulting, custom applications, business integration, business process management, and customer relationship management, among others. The platforms with which we have significant domain expertise and on which these solutions are built include IBM, Microsoft, Oracle Salesforce, Magento and Adobe, among others.

&#183;

Industry Expertise . We serve many of the world's largest and most respected companies with extensive business process experience across a variety of markets. These markets include healthcare (including pharma and life sciences), financial services (including banking and insurance), retail and consumer goods, automotive and transport products, electronics and computer hardware, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and utilities, business services, and leisure, and media and entertainment markets, among others. 

&#183;

Delivery Model and Methodology . We believe our significant domain expertise enables us to provide high-value solutions through expert project teams that deliver measurable results by working collaboratively with clients through a user-centered, technology-based, and business-driven solutions methodology. Our methodology includes a proven execution process map we developed, which allows for repeatable, high quality services delivery. The methodology leverages the thought leadership of our senior strategists and practitioners to support the client project team and focuses on transforming our clients' business processes to provide enhanced customer value and operating efficiency, enabled by web technology. As a result, we believe we are able to offer our clients the dedicated attention that small firms usually provide and the delivery and project management that larger firms usually offer.

&#160;

&#183;

Client Relationships . We have built a track record of quality solutions and client satisfaction through the timely, efficient, and successful completion of numerous projects for our clients. As a result, we have established long-term relationships with many of our clients who continue to engage us for additional projects and serve as references for us. For the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively, of services revenues were derived from clients who continued to utilize our services from the prior year, excluding any revenues from acquisitions completed in that year. 

&#183;

Vendor Relationship and Endorsements . We have built meaningful relationships with software providers, whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients. These relationships enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners' marketing efforts and endorsements. We also serve as a sales channel for our partners, helping them market and sell their software products. We are an IBM Premier Business Partner, a Microsoft National Solutions Provider and Gold Certified Partner, an Oracle Platinum Partner, and a Salesforce Platinum Cloud Alliance Partner. In 2015, we received multiple awards and recognition from our partners, including, among others: 

&#160;

&#183;

IBM Worldwide Analytics Business Partner of the Year;

&#183;

IBM Beacon Award - Outstanding Information Management Solution;

&#183;

Microsoft EPG U.S. Partner and Industry Team Partner of the Year;

&#183;

Oracle Health Sciences Partner Excellence Award; and

&#183;

Magento Spirit of Excellence North America Award.

&#183;

Offshore Capability . We serve our clients from locations in multiple m arkets throughout North America, and, in addition, we operate global development centers in Hangzhou, China and Chennai and Nagpur, India. T hese facilities are staffed with colleagues who have specializations that include application development, adapter and interface development, quality assurance and testing, monitoring and support, product development, platform migration, and portal development with expertise in IBM, Microsoft Oracle and Magento technologies. In addition to our offshore capabilities, we employ a number of foreign nationals in the United States on H1-B visas. The facility in Chennai, India is also a recruiting and development facility used to continue to grow our base of H1-B foreign national colleagues. As of December 31, 2015, we had 182 colleagues at the Hangzhou, China facility, 139 colleagues at the Chennai, India facility, 295 colleagues at the Nagpur, India facility, and 261 colleagues with H1-B visas. We intend to continue to leverage our existing offshore capabilities to support our growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery.

&#160;

&#183;

Onshore Capability . In 2015, we established a domestic delivery center (the "DDC") in Lafayette, Louisiana. The DDC augments our offshore delivery centers in India and China, further optimizing our global network and comprehensive technology, delivery management and industry vertical expertise across North America. With the addition of the DDC, we have increased capabilities and improved service levels that cover the entire spectrum of the software development lifecycle. 

Competition

The market for the services we provide is competitive and has low barriers to entry. We believe that our competitors fall into several categories, including:

&#183;

small local consulting firms that operate in no more than one or two geographic regions;

&#183;

boutique consulting firms, such as Prolifics and Avanade;

&#183;

national consulting firms, such as Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, Cognizant, and Sapient/ Publicis;

&#183;

in-house professional services organizations of software companies; and

&#183;

offshore providers, such as Infosys Technologies Limited and Wipro Limited.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include domain expertise, track record and customer references, partner network with leading technology companies, quality of proposed solutions, service quality and performance, efficiency, reliability, scalability and features of the software platforms upon which the solutions are based, and the ability to implement solutions quickly and respond on a timely basis to customer needs. In addition, because of the relatively low barriers to entry into this market, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. We expect competition from offshore outsourcing and development companies to continue.

Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater name recognition, and possess significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to attract customers to which we market our services and adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer or industry requirements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 2,678 employees, 2,248 of which were billable (excluding 191 billable subcontractors) and 430 of which were involved in sales, administration, and marketing. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We are committed to the continued development of our employees. 

Sales and Marketing . As of December 31, 2015, we had a 107 -person direct solutions-oriented sales force. We reward our sales force for developing and maintaining relationships with our clients, seeking follow-up engagements, and leveraging those relationships to forge new relationships in different areas of the business and with our clients' business partners. Approximately 85% of our sales are executed by our direct sales force. In addition to our direct sales team, we also have 41 dedicated sales support employees, 30 general managers and 11 vice-presidents who are engaged in our sales and marketing efforts.

We have sales and marketing partnerships with software vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Magento and Adobe, among others. These companies are key vendors of open standards-based software commonly referred to as middleware application servers, enterprise application integration platforms, business process management, cloud computing applications, business activity monitoring and business intelligence applications, and enterprise portal server software. Our direct sales force works in tandem with the sales and marketing groups of our partners to identify potential new clients and projects. Our partnerships with these companies enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners' marketing efforts and endorsements.

Recruiting . We are dedicated to hiring, developing, and retaining experienced, motivated technology professionals who combine a depth of understanding of current Internet and legacy technologies with the ability to implement complex and cutting-edge solutions. We believe in an employee-centered environment that is built on a culture of respect. 

Retention . We firmly believe in the power of partnership and the spirit of innovation and approach every opportunity with these philosophies in mind. We focus on a core set of digital experience, business optimization, and industry solutions, applications, and software platforms and our commitment to our employees' career development through continued training and advancement opportunities sets us apart as an employer of choice. 

Compensation . Our compensation philosophy and programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees based on performance and results. Our tiered incentive compensation plans help us reach our overall goals by rewarding individuals for their influence on key performance factors and allow for differentiation so that truly stellar performers may be rewarded.
