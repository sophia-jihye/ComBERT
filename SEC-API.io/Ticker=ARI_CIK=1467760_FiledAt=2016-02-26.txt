GENERAL 

Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. is a corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and primarily originates, acquires, invests in and manages performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. These asset classes are referred to as the Company&#8217;s target assets. 

The Company is externally managed and advised by ACREFI Management, LLC (the &#8220;Manager&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Apollo&#8221;), a leading global alternative investment manager with a contrarian and value oriented investment approach in private equity, credit and real estate. Apollo had total assets under management of $170 billion as of December 31, 2015 . The Manager is led by an experienced team of senior real estate professionals who have significant experience in underwriting and structuring commercial real financing transactions. The Company benefits from Apollo&#8217;s global infrastructure and operating platform, through which the Company is able to source, evaluate and manage potential investments in the Company&#8217;s target assets. 

The Company&#8217;s principal business objective is to make investments in its target assets in order to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to its stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company held a diversified portfolio comprised of approximately $994,301 &#32;of commercial mortgage loans, $931,351 &#32;of subordinate loans, $493,149 &#32;of CMBS and $153,193 &#32;of CMBS, held-to-maturity. The Company has financed this portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;with $925,774 &#32;of borrowings under the Company&#8217;s master repurchase agreements, $118,201 &#32;of participations sold and $254,750 aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Convertible Senior Notes"). 

The Company is a Maryland corporation that was organized in 2009 and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009. The Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its taxable income to the extent that it annually distributes its net taxable income to stockholders and maintains its intended qualification as a REIT. The Company also operates its business in a manner intended to allow it to remain excluded from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 

INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

To identify attractive opportunities within its target assets, the Company relies on the expertise of the Manager and its affiliates as well as their platform which integrates real estate experience with private equity and capital markets, in transaction sourcing, underwriting, execution, asset operation, management and disposition. In the near-to-medium term, the Company expects to continue to deploy its capital through the origination and acquisition of senior performing commercial mortgage loans, subordinate financings, CMBS and other commercial real-estate related debt investments at attractive risk-adjusted yields. 

The Company targets investments that are secured by institutional quality real estate. The Company&#8217;s underwriting includes a focus on stressed in-place cash flows, debt yields, debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-values, property quality and market and sub-market dynamics. The Manager may also take advantage of opportunistic pricing dislocations created by distressed sellers or distressed capital structures where a lender or holder of a loan or security is in a compromised situation due to the relative size of its portfolio, the magnitude of nonperforming loans, or regulatory/rating agency issues driven by potential capital adequacy or concentration issues. In pursuing investments with attractive risk-reward profiles, the Company incorporates its views of the current and future economic environment, its outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes and its assessment of the risk-reward profile derived from its underwriting and cash flow analysis, including taking into account relative valuation, supply and demand fundamentals, the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, prepayment rates, financing and liquidity, real estate prices, delinquencies, default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. In general, the Company pursues a value-driven approach to underwriting and diligence, consistent with the historical investment strategy of the Manager and its affiliates. Each prospective investment receives a rigorous, credit-oriented 

evaluation towards determining the risk/return profile of the opportunity and the appropriate pricing and structure for the prospective investment. On the Company&#8217;s behalf, the Manager has implemented underwriting standards founded on fundamental market and credit analyses with a focus on current and sustainable cash flows. These underwriting standards place a particular emphasis on due diligence of the sponsor/borrower. The Company also utilizes forward currency contracts to economically hedge interest and principal payments due under its loans denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. All investment decisions are made with a view to maintaining the Company&#8217;s qualification as a REIT and its exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act. 

FINANCING STRATEGY 

The Company uses borrowings as part of its financing strategy. The Company believes the amount of leverage it uses is consistent with the Company&#8217;s intention of keeping total borrowings within a prudent range, as determined by the Manager, taking into account a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of target assets in the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio, the gap between the duration of assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, the creditworthiness of the Company&#8217;s financing counterparties, the health of the global economy and commercial and residential mortgage markets, the outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rate movement, the credit quality of the Company&#8217;s target assets and the type of collateral underlying such target assets. In utilizing leverage, the Company seeks to enhance equity returns while limiting interest rate exposure. In addition to current repurchase facilities, the Company may access additional repurchase facilities and more traditional borrowings such as credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had $445,942 &#32;of borrowings outstanding under the Company&#8217;s $600,000 repurchase facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;) (the &#8220;JPMorgan Facility&#8221;), $133,899 &#32;of borrowings outstanding under the Company's repurchase facility with UBS AG, London Branch ("UBS") (the "UBS Facility"), $300,005 &#32;of borrowings outstanding under the Company's repurchase facility with Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") (the "DB Facility") and $45,928 &#32;of borrowings outstanding under the Company's repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (the &#8220;Goldman Loan&#8221;). 

To the extent market conditions improve and markets stabilize over time, the Company may increase its borrowing levels. In the future, the Company may also seek to raise further equity or debt capital in order to fund future investments. See Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for a further discussion of the Company&#8217;s borrowings as of December 31, 2015 . 

From time to time, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Under the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, the Company generally is able to enter into certain transactions to hedge indebtedness it incurs to acquire or carry real estate assets, although the total gross income from interest rate hedges that does not meet this requirement and other non-qualifying sources generally must not exceed 5% of the Company&#8217;s gross income. 

The Company also may engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate changes in interest rates or other potential influences on the values of its assets. The U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs may require the Company to implement certain of these techniques through a domestic taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) that is fully subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation. 

The Company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk and to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of match funded financing structures, when appropriate, whereby the Company may seek (1) to match the maturities of its debt obligations with the maturities of its assets and (2) to match the interest rates on its assets with like-kind debt (i.e., the Company may finance floating rate assets with floating rate debt and fixed-rate assets with fixed-rate debt), directly or through the use of interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, or other financial instruments, or through a combination of these strategies. The Company expects these instruments will allow it to minimize, but not eliminate, the risk that the Company may have to refinance its liabilities before the maturities of its assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on its earnings. 

See Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s borrowings under repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2015 . 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Company strives to maintain an ethical workplace in which the highest standards of professional conduct are practiced. 

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s board of directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. 

&#8226; 

In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all business relationships, the Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, which cover a wide range of business practices and procedures that apply to all of its directors and officers. In addition, the Company has implemented Whistle Blowing Procedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters (the &#8220;Whistleblower Policy&#8221;) that set forth procedures by which Covered Persons (as defined in the Whistleblower Policy) may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns regarding, among other things, any questionable or unethical accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters with the Audit Committee. Third parties, such as clients, shareholders or competitors of the Company may also report a good faith complaint regarding such matters. 

&#8226; 

The Company has an insider trading policy that prohibits any of its directors or employees, partners, directors and officers of Apollo, as well as others, from buying or selling the Company&#8217;s securities on the basis of material nonpublic information. 

COMPETITION 

The Company&#8217;s net income depends, in part, on management&#8217;s ability to acquire assets that generate favorable spreads over their borrowing costs. In acquiring target assets, the Company competes with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. In addition, there are other REITs with similar asset acquisition objectives and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase and origination. These competitors may be significantly larger than the Company, have access to greater capital and other resources or may have other advantages. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, 

and establish more relationships, than the Company. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of investment and financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

EMPLOYEES; STAFFING 

The Company has no employees and is managed by the Manager pursuant to the management agreement between the Manager and the Company, dated as of September 23, 2009 (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;). All of the Company&#8217;s officers are employees of the Manager or its affiliates.
