 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. EGP-437, our first and only product in clinical trials, incorporates a reformulated topically active corticosteroid, dexamethasone phosphate, that is delivered into the ocular tissues through our proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System. EGP-437 is being developed under the 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, regulatory pathway for drugs submitted for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its NDA.

&#160;

The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System and EGP-437, are designed to address two major issues in ophthalmic medicine: lack of patient compliance and safety. The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System features a compact, elegant, and easy-to-use device that we believe has the potential to deliver drugs non-invasively and quickly into the ocular tissues through the use of iontophoresis, which can accelerate the onset of action, dramatically reduce treatment frequency versus eye drops and sustain therapeutic effect. Iontophoresis employs the use of a low electrical current that promotes the migration of a charged drug substance across biological membranes. The current produces ions, which through electrorepulsion, drive a like-charged drug substance into the tissues. The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System is easy-to-use, only takes a few minutes to employ and more than 1,700 experimental treatments have been administered in clinical trials.

&#160;

We are developing EGP-437 for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions of the eye, including uveitis, a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris and/or ciliary body and macular edema, an abnormal thickening of the macula associated with the accumulation of excess fluids in the retina. Based on guidance provided by the FDA, the Company expects that if the planned confirmatory Phase 3 trial of EGP-437 in anterior uveitis meets non-inferiority criteria, data from this trial along with data from our previously completed Phase 3 trial in anterior uveitis will be sufficient to support a NDA filing. The Company also believes, based on guidance provided by the FDA, that the design of the planned confirmatory Phase 3 anterior uveitis trial is acceptable and that the nonclinical work completed to date is sufficient to support a NDA filing.

&#160;

We have entered into an exclusive global license agreement with a subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (&#8220;Valeant&#8221;), through which EyeGate has granted Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to its EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product, or the Product, in the field of uveitis, as well as a right of last negotiation to license the Product for other indications. Eyegate shall be responsible for the development of the Product in the U.S. for the indication of anterior uveitis, together with the costs associated therewith. Valeant has the right to develop the Product in the field outside of the U.S. and has agreed to fund 100% of any costs associated therewith.

&#160;

The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System has the potential to offer a non-invasive method of drug delivery as an alternative to the current delivery modalities used for treating ocular diseases, such as eye drops and ocular injections. In-office preparation is simple and efficient and can be completed by nursing or other office staff. We have demonstrated in the clinic, through our first leg of the Phase 1b/2a macular edema proof-of-concept trial the ability to deliver EGP-437 to the back-of-the-eye non-invasively using the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System.

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. The key elements of this strategy are to:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Complete exploratory trial for back-of-the-eye delivery with our EGP-437 Combination Product . As an anti-inflammatory agent, our EGP-437 Combination Product has the potential to be used to treat back-of-the-eye diseases that have an inflammatory component, like macular edema. We have completed the first leg of a Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of various forms of macular edema. We expect to have top-line data from the second leg of the Phase 1b/2a proofof- concept trial treating macular edema in by the end of the second quarter of 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Continue clinical development of our EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis . We have initiated and begun enrolling patients for the confirmatory Phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of our EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. Based on our estimates regarding subject enrollment, we expect to have topline data for this trial by the end of the first quarter 2017. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Utilize the EyeGate iontophoresis expertise to expand our drug delivery platform for the treatment of eye diseases . Our initial platform, the EyeGate&#174; II Drug Delivery System, is an in-office treatment performed by an eye care giver. We plan to develop a system based on iontophoresis that could be applied at home by the patient. This would be ideal for the treatment of certain chronic ocular diseases where less frequent visits to the eye care givers office are required. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Pursue other strategic collaborations. We plan to evaluate opportunities to enter into collaborations that may contribute to our ability to advance our drug delivery platform and product candidates and to progress concurrently a range of discovery and development programs. We also plan to evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies for the treatment of eye diseases. &#160; 

Ophthalmic Market Opportunity 

&#160;

Ophthalmology is a specialty market with commercial and regulatory dynamics that make it possible for small or medium sized companies like us to develop and commercialize products on our own. We believe that the specialists in the U.S. who treat ocular diseases are sufficiently concentrated that we could effectively promote our products with a specialty sales and marketing group.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Lead Product: EGP-437 

&#160; 

Back-of-the-eye 

&#160;

Interim data from our Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept trial suggests that iontophoresis can non-invasively deliver EGP-437 to the back of the eye. The non-invasive delivery of EGP-437 has demonstrated a positive response in some patients with macular edema. A positive response was observed in some of the patients, with pseudophakic eyes (an eye implanted with an intraocular lens) responding better than phakic eyes (an eye with a natural lens). Additionally, the investigational therapy showed no serious treatment emergent adverse effects including no increase in ocular pressure even at three times the iontophoretic dose that was used for the Company&#8217;s Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial. Our non-invasive and proprietary EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System is designed to deliver optimal quantities of drugs to the anterior or posterior segments of the eye.

&#160;

To achieve adequate therapeutic levels of drug at the back of the eye in patients while at the same time minimizing systemic distribution, we have developed an ocular iontophoresis device that we believe is designed to more effectively provide adequate drug levels in the posterior segment of the eye than conventional methods. Delivery of therapeutic agents using ocular iontophoresis has been of interest as a means of non-invasively achieving higher drug levels within the eye by promoting the migration of a charged drug substance across biological membranes with a low electrical current. The current produces ions, which via electrorepulsion, drive a like-charged drug substance into the ocular tissues.

&#160;

The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System applicator utilizes an inert electrode, which stimulates the electrolysis of water to produce ions (hydroxide or hydronium) that are required to deliver charged molecules. The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System delivery platform requires custom pharmaceutical formulations to enable delivery efficiency and safety while allowing for potential novel intellectual property. The data from multiple clinical trials suggests that EGP-437 does not significantly raise mean intraocular pressure, or IOP, at the time points evaluated during the study period.

&#160;

The Unmet Need 

&#160;

Currently, the only primary route of administration for drugs treating retinal diseases is through intravitreal injection into the vitreous of the eye. These injections must be given as frequently as once per month when treating chronic diseases like macular degeneration. Unfortunately, there are known drawbacks associated with administering intravitreal injections, including safety risks, adverse patient experience and being time- and labor-intensive to administer.

&#160;

The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System could potentially reduce the impact of the issues described above by providing eye care practitioners and patients with a non-invasive solution for treating retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration. The treatment with our EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System can be administered by a wider group of eye care practitioners than currently giving intravitreal injections and reduces the risks associated with invasive procedures. In-office preparation is simple and efficient and can be completed by nursing or other office staff with actual dosing taking approximately three minutes and total treatment time including preparation taking about seven minutes per eye.

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Front-of-the-eye 

&#160;

Many front of the eye diseases such as non-infectious anterior uveitis and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis are acute inflammatory conditions. The current standard of care to treat ocular surface and anterior segment inflammation is patient administered corticosteroids in the form of eye drops. Topical corticosteroids suffer from a number of drawbacks including low ocular bioavailability, rapid clearance and steroid-related side effects including elevated IOP or cataract formation.

&#160;

For example, to achieve a successful therapeutic outcome when treating non-infectious anterior uveitis, patients must follow a rigorous dosing schedule for four to six weeks. At a minimum, patients are required to give themselves at least 154 treatments of the standard of care over this period. Given this heavy burden, patient non-compliance is prevalent and is the main cause of treatment failure. Treatment failures may lead to complications causing temporary or permanent loss of vision. When topical treatments fail due to lack of compliance or inadequate response, the alternative is more aggressive steroid therapy, such as ocular and intravenous injections, which is often associated with steroid-related adverse effects such as elevated IOP and cataract formation. Thus, the significant unmet needs in this treatment category include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Improving patient compliance which is the main cause of treatment failure which can lead to temporary or permanent loss of vision; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Eliminating the patient treatment burden of at least 154 eye drops or more for many patients over four to six weeks; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Reducing treatment related side effects including elevated IOP. &#160;

We believe that our EGP-437 Combination Product has the potential to address these unmet needs by only requiring two or three in-office treatments provided by the eye care provider thereby mitigating the patient compliance issues and substantially reducing the burden of care. Additionally, our clinical trials to date appear to demonstrate a good safety profile, including minimal impact on IOP, and a reduction of inflammation that was demonstrated in four randomized, double-masked clinical studies using our EGP-437 Combination Product.

&#160;

During 2014, we announced results from a Phase 3 trial of the EGP-437 Combination Product in the lead indication of non-infectious anterior uveitis. The study suggests that two iontophoretic treatments of our EGP-437 Combination Product over a 4-week period achieved the same response rate as 154 drops of PA, and with fewer incidences of elevated IOP. Although we achieved the same response rate in our Phase 3 trial, the dose of the EGP-437 Combination Product tested was just outside the pre-set non-inferiority margin and did not achieve statistical significance as compared to the positive control based on the primary efficacy endpoint.

&#160; 

Targeted Indications 

&#160; 

EGP-437: Macular Edema 

&#160;

Broadly defined, macular edema is an abnormal thickening of the macula, an area at the back of the eye responsible for XX/XX vision, associated with the accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the neurosensory retina. Several basic pathophysiologic processes, in conjunction with a vast variety of pathologic conditions, are thought to contribute to the development of macular edema. The pathological processes leading to macular edema involve numerous inflammatory cells, cytokines, growth factors, and intercellular adhesion molecules, which are associated with increased vascular permeability, breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and up-regulation of proangiogenic factors. As a final common pathway in numerous retinal disorders such as retinal vein occlusion, or RVO, diabetic retinopathy, and cystoid macular edema, macular edema, in its various forms, can be considered the leading cause of central vision loss in the developed world, and it is therefore of enormous medical and socio-economic importance.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As stated above, the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System has shown the potential to deliver significant quantities of EGP-437 to the back-of-the-eye tissues including the retina, vitreous and choroid. The risks, the patient experience and the physician practice inefficiencies associated with intravitreal injections provides an opportunity for the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System to play a role in treating retinal diseases, like macular edema.

&#160; 

EGP-437: Non-Infectious Anterior Uveitis 

&#160;

Uveitis is a general term for inflammation of the uveal tract and encompasses a wide range of etiologies. It may be iodiopathic, associated with systemic diseases or result from a variety of infectious agents. An annual estimated 17.6% of active uveitis patients experience transient or permanent loss of vision. Uveitis is responsible for more than 2.8% of cases of blindness in the U.S., making this disorder an important cause of vision loss and impairment. Non-infectious anterior uveitis is a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris and/or ciliary body and is the most common form of uveitis. Incidence in the U.S. ranges from approximately 26.6 &#8211; 102 per 100,000 adults annually with recent reports indicating occurrence in all age groups with the highest incidence in those over age 65 years. Chronic or recurrent, anterior uveitis may lead to complications such as posterior subcapsular cataract, glaucoma and macular edema.

&#160;

Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and white blood cells from the blood into the injured tissues, in this case the uvea. Sometimes, the inflammation associated with anterior uveitis is in response to a real infection. This is known as infectious anterior uveitis. However, anterior uveitis often occurs for no apparent reason as the result of the immune system malfunctioning and triggering the process of inflammation even though no infection is present. This is known as non-infectious anterior uveitis. Patients that have anterior uveitis exhibit a large number of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. In order to count these cells in the anterior chamber, the physician uses a slit lamp, an instrument consisting of a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine a thin sheet of light into the eye. The treatment objective is to eliminate the inflammation of the uvea which can be confirmed by an anterior chamber cell count of zero.

&#160; 

EGP-437: Dry Eye 

&#160;

Dry eye syndrome (DES), is the most prevalent form of ocular discomfort and irritation. In the U.S., it has been estimated that as many as approximately 3.2 million women and approximately 1.7 million men over the age of 50 have DES. In addition, tens of millions more experience a mild form of DES or episodic problems with DES, usually associated with external stimuli. With the aging population in the U.S. and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing computer use, DES is expected to become more prevalent.

&#160;

While intermittent DES can be related to external environmental factors, the chronic condition is related to internal factors, such as hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disease, the use of many widely prescribed systemic medications, anatomical changes or trauma, and aging. The fundamental (and most likely the causative) problem behind chronic DES is deficiency in either the volume or composition of the tear film. Problems related to the tear film produce an immune-based inflammation of the ocular surface. Symptoms of chronic DES can range from a mildly irritating condition to loss of function and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and the misery that accompanies significantly impaired vision and decreased quality of life.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Increasing evidence suggests that ocular surface inflammation is present in all chronic DES patients. As a consequence, anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solutions are being intensively evaluated for the prolonged clinical use required to treat chronic DES. Restasis&#174; (0.05% topical Cyclosporine A suspension, Allergan) is the only FDA-approved therapeutic agent for dry eye disease; however, it has proven effective in treating only 15% of all dry eye patients. Restasis&#174; has been shown to be safe for long-term use, but may take several weeks to produce a therapeutic effect, and up to six months for maximal effectiveness. Thus, the need for more-effective therapies to treat DES remains substantial. Topical corticosteroids are used off-label to reduce signs and symptoms of DES. While corticosteroid eye drops are widely used to treat DES, their low ocular bioavailability (estimated to be 1 &#8211; 10%) may limit their effectiveness. Therefore, alternative corticosteroid dosing techniques, such as iontophoresis, that enhance drug bioavailability in the eye may be a viable therapeutic option.

&#160;

EGP-437: Cataract Surgery 

&#160;

Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and there are more than 24 million people age 40 and older who have cataracts in the U.S. alone, according to the Vision Problems in the U.S. report from Prevent Blindness. A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. Most cataracts are related to aging and are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of the U.S. population either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the population aged over 65 years. There are approximately 3 million cataract surgeries performed per year in the U.S. As the technology of cataract surgery has progressed, so too, has the increased patient demand for excellent vision and safety after the procedure, but visual rehabilitation after cataract surgery is sometimes delayed by the inflammatory processes that are induced by phacoemulsification where the eye&#8217;s internal lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Inflammation is induced in all cataract surgery by the mechanical transmission of energy into the eye, disruption of cell membranes, and the normal healing process. Postoperative topical corticosteroids are used routinely to reduce inflammation and improve visual outcomes after cataract surgery. Despite their use, transient corneal edema is one of the major factors hindering the improvement of vision in the first days after surgery, and cystoid macula edema may reduce quality of vision for weeks and months after the procedure. Therefore, reducing inflammation and its potential damage to the corneal endothelium and retina is a high priority for the ophthalmic surgeon.

&#160; 

Clinical Trial Results 

&#160;

We submitted an IND for EGP-437 to the FDA on April 28, 2008. The initial protocol submitted as part of the IND application was for our Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial. Subsequently, we submitted amendments to our IND for protocols for additional trials that we have since completed on September 12, 2008, April 6, 2010, October 18, 2011, April 13, 2012 and May 20, 2015. An IND application (IND 107,846) referencing our IND (IND 77,888) was submitted by the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine on January 29, 2010 with a protocol for the treatment of anterior scleritis.

&#160;

We have completed five clinical trials under IND 107,846 for the EGP-437 Combination Product. The first two trials were executed in parallel &#8212; a Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial and a Phase 2 dry eye trial. These two trials were followed by a Phase 3 dry eye trial. Subsequently, we completed our first Phase 3 trial for non-infectious anterior uveitis. During the time that we executed the Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial we completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept cataract surgery trial, with prophylactic treatment of the EGP-437 Combination Product. We have reported interim results for our Phase 1b/2a macular edema trial.

Macular Edema: Phase 1b/2a Trial 

&#160;

We have reported interim data for our first clinical trial treating a back of the eye indication, macular edema. The Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept trial suggests that iontophoresis can non-invasively deliver EGP-437 to the back of the eye. The non-invasive delivery of EGP-437 has demonstrated a positive response in some patients with macular edema.

&#160;

The ongoing Phase 1b / 2a clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label trial. To date, the interim data was based on the first 19 patients enrolled and had macular edema associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion, Diabetic Retinopathy or Post-Surgical (cystoid) Macular Edema. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iontophoretic EGP-437 in patients suffering from Macular Edema. Three treatments at 14.0 mA-min (3.5mA) were administered on day 0, day 4 and day 9. Primary outcome of the trial measured reduction in mean central subfield thickness on day 4, day, 9 and day 14. Ozurdex&#174; was administered as control to patients that did not respond to the investigational therapy at day 14 and were re-evaluated at day 28.

&#160;

A positive response was observed in some of the patients, with pseudophakic eyes (an eye implanted with an intraocular lens) responding better than phakic eyes (an eye with a natural lens). Additionally, the investigational therapy showed no serious treatment emergent adverse effects including no increase in ocular pressure even at three times the iontophoretic dose that was used for the Company&#8217;s Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial.

&#160;

The trial has been extended to recruit an additional 15 patients with a modified dosing regimen, three consecutive days at the same iontophoretic dosage. It was observed that the edema returns when drug has cleared from the tissues. Thus the new dosing regimen may help to overcome this issue by providing a cumulative effect. The extension of the trial will also evaluate the efficacy of iontophoretic EGP-437 in phakic versus pseudophakic eyes to collect additional data on the differences in the responses of both types of eyes. The top-line date from the extension of the trial is expected in second quarter of 2016.

&#160; 

Non-infectious Anterior Uveitis: Phase 1/2 Trial 

&#160;

Our first clinical trial initiated with the EGP-437 Combination Product was a Phase 1/2 trial for subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis, which was defined as having anterior chamber cell (ACC) scores &#8805; 1.5, or in other words, cell counts of less than or equal to 11 cells. Subjects who have anterior uveitis, exhibit a large number of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. The treatment objective is to eliminate the inflammation which can be visually confirmed when all white blood cells have been cleared from the anterior chamber. The degree of intraocular inflammation is based on a grading scheme or score that uses an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, as set forth in the table below.

&#160;

&#160;

The primary objective of this exploratory study was to define a safe and effective dose of EGP-437 in subjects with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis. The secondary objective was to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetic profile of EGP-437 (dexamethasone and dexamethasone phosphate) following ocular dosing.

&#160;

This multi-site, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, dose comparison, exploratory study comprised five visits conducted over 28 days. The study population was comprised of 40 eyes of 40 subjects. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of four iontophoresis dose levels of EGP-437 for approximately 4 minutes with up to 10 subjects per treatment arm. Subjects received a single treatment only, at Day 0, subjects returned for examination on Days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Eligible subjects received one of the following four iontophoresis dose levels of EGP-437 (dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution (40mg/mL)) for approximately 4 minutes:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Treatment Group A: 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Treatment Group B: 4.8 mA-min at 1.2 mA &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Treatment Group C: 10.0 mA-min at 2.5 mA &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Treatment Group D: 14.0 mA-min at 3.5 mA &#160;

Following the single treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product, 48% of the subjects achieved an ACC score of zero within two weeks. By Day 28, 60% of the subjects achieved an ACC score of zero and required no further treatment. At Day 14, in the lowest treatment group, the proportion of subjects with an ACC count of zero was 4/10 (40%) and for all treatment groups was 7/40 (18%). At Day 28, in the lowest treatment group, the proportion of subjects with an ACC count of zero was higher at 6/10 (60%) and for all treatment groups was 14/40 (35%). The highest proportion of subjects with an ACC score or ACC count of zero was in the 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA treatment group at both Days 14 and 28.

The median time in days to an ACC score of zero ranged from a minimum of 11.5 days in the 1.6 mA-min dose group to a maximum of 31.0 days in the 14.0 mA-min dose group. The proportion of patients with an ACC score reduction of 0.5 or more on Day 28 was 80% (eight) in the 1.6 mA-min dose group and 60% (six) in the other three dose groups. The mean change in ACC score from baseline to Day 28 ranged from a maximum of -2.25 in the 1.6 mA-min dose group to a minimum of -2.00 in the 14.0 mA-min dose group. The relatively short mean times to reach an ACC score of zero in each dose group suggest that the treatment has a rapid onset of action.

The results from this trial appeared to demonstrate that the most effective EGP-437 dose level are in the 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA dose level. The level of association between the iontophoresis treatments and achieving an ACC Score of zero was assessed and the association was estimated to be statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (p-value = 0.032) on Day 14, suggesting that the treatment differences are larger than would be expected by chance alone. The probability-value or p-value is a number between 0.00 and 1.00, and is used to demonstrate the strength of a conclusion drawn from clinical trial data. Essentially the p-value measures consistency between the results actually obtained in the trial and the &#8220;pure chance&#8221; explanation for those results. A statement and corresponding p-value are considered of strong significance if the probability of the same reaction occurring randomly or by chance is less than 5%, corresponding to a p-value of p&#60;0.05.

&#160;

This trial showed low short-term systemic exposure to dexamethasone following ocular iontophoresis delivery of dexamethasone phosphate, and no corticosteroid mediated effects were observed.

&#160;

While this dose-ranging study did not include positive or negative controls, the results demonstrated that a single treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product: (1) lowered ACC scores in the majority of patients without requiring additional treatment and (2) produced low short-term systemic exposure to dexamethasone and dexamethasone phosphate.

&#160;

Non-infectious Anterior Uveitis: Phase 3 Clinical Trial 

&#160;

Our previous Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis clinical trial, and two dry eye clinical trials, showed that the EGP-437 dose selected for the Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial was well tolerated and demonstrated positive activity. The Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis clinical trial was conducted to assess safety and efficacy of the EGP-437 Combination Product and evaluate its non-inferiority status to a standard of care, prednisolone acetate 1% (PA) eye drops. Communication received from the FDA, dated December 3, 2007, stated that the FDA recommends that PA, administered at least four times per day (q.i.d.), be the positive control agent for the treatment of anterior uveitis. Our trial utilized a more stringent regimen for the positive control of eight times per day in week one and six times per day in week two before going to four times per day in weeks three and four. Patients had to agree to comply with dosing regimen to be included in the trial.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The completed Phase 3 non-inferiority study in patients with non-infectious anterior uveitis appeared to demonstrate that two iontophoretic treatments with our EGP-437 Combination Product achieved the same response rate as the positive control for the primary efficacy endpoint, a complete clearing of anterior chamber cells, by day 14. The control is the current standard of care, PA, which was administered multiple times daily as eye drops. Although we achieved the same response rate in our Phase 3 clinical trial, the dose of the EGP-437 Combination Product tested was just outside the pre-set non-inferiority margin for intent-to-treat and per protocol populations and did not achieve statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population as compared to the positive control based on the primary efficacy endpoint.

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; The EGP-437 Combination Product produced the same outcomes compared to PA while eliminating the need to apply up to 8 eye drops a day, for a total of 154 drops over a four week period &#8212; eight times per day for week one, six times per day for week two and four times per day for weeks three and four. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; This was achieved with a lower incidence of increased IOP, which is characterized as an increase of six mm Hg or more from baseline; in the EGP-437 Combined Product group, 14 subjects had 17 occurrences while 24 subjects had 41 occurrences in the PA arm. &#160;

Phase 3 Safety Discussion 

&#160;

Our EGP-437 Combination Product appears to be clinically comparable to PA topical drops. With regard to elevated IOP, no subjects in the EGP-437 Combination Product treatment arm experienced any significant increase in IOP (greater than 20mmHg), whereas the PA treatment arm had one subject with a reported IOP increase of 27mmHg. With regard to IOP-related adverse events, one subject in the EGP-437 Combination Product treatment group reported an adverse event (seen approximately three weeks after rescue was initiated) and six subjects in the PA treatment arm reported adverse events related to IOP.

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Trial Conclusion 

&#160;

Topical corticosteroid therapy administered as frequently as every hour with tapering over the treatment period has been the mainstay for uveitis treatment since the 1950s. In this unique Phase 3 randomized, double-masked, positive-controlled clinical trial in subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis, two treatments with ocular iontophoretic delivery of EGP-437 appears to be clinically comparable to PA topical drops administered with a tapering schedule from eight drops per day to four drops per day over 28 days.

&#160;

By days seven and fourteen, the proportion of subjects reaching ACC counts of zero was slightly greater in the EGP-437 Combination Product arm than the PA arm. This effect was more noticeable in the subgroup of subjects with a higher baseline ACC count; a higher proportion of subjects in the EGP-437 Combination Product arm reached an ACC count of zero by Days 7 and 14 in this sub-group of subjects. Safety findings were comparable for both study arms.

&#160; 

Dry Eye: Phase 2 Trial 

&#160;

105 subjects were randomized into this 3-armed, single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial comprised seven visits conducted over three weeks. The objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of the EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye. Two sets of iontophoresis conditions (7.5 mA-min at 2.5 mA and 10.5 mA-min at 3.5 mA) to create a low-dose and a high-dose group. The control group received ocular iontophoresis of 100 mM sodium citrate buffer (10.5 mA-min at 3.5 mA).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Treatment Group &#160; &#160; 7.5 mA-min at 2.5 mA &#160; 10.5 mA-min at 3.5 mA &#160; Placebo &#160; Total 41 &#160; 38 &#160; 26 &#160; 105 &#160;

The controlled adverse environmental (CAE) system was used to reproducibly exacerbate the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The CAE is a clinical model emulating some environmental conditions (low humidity, high temperature, visual tasking) that contribute to drying the ocular surface. The CAE system exacerbates the signs and symptoms of dry eye in a reproducible manner. The CAE model has been shown to correlate with accepted murine models of dry eye and has been used extensively in ophthalmic clinical trials. The main objective of the CAE system is for screening and eligibility purposes. A baseline reading of various signs and symptoms of the disease are taken prior and post to exacerbation by the CAE system. A week later this is repeated and the subjects that acted in a reproducible manner are enrolled into the study. This is important as dry eye is a syndrome that is caused by many different etiologies and one treatment may not be sufficient for all.

&#160;

The trial was designed to evaluate effects among different clinical scenarios, including: Treatment, the effects of treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product following CAE-induced signs and symptoms; Prevention, the effects of treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product prior to CAE exposure; Recovery, the effects of treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product on recovery towards baseline at follow-up visits (24 hours and 7 days after CAE); and Environmental (periods of time not directly influenced by the CAE), the ability of the EGP-437 Combination Product to improve dry eye signs and symptoms over the entire 3-week study period.

&#160;

The trial included seven visits over three weeks: subjects were exposed to the CAE for 90 minutes at three visits (visits 1, 3, and 5 &#8212; CAE visits), and the remaining visits (visits 2, 4, 6, 7) were conducted for follow-up.

&#160;

At each trial visit (both pre- and post-CAE at Visits 1, 3 and 5), dry eye signs (corneal and conjunctival staining, conjunctival redness, tear film break-up time, or TFBUT, blink rate, ocular protection index (OPI), and corneal sensitivity) and symptoms (ocular discomfort before, during, and after the CAE exposure, several symptom questionnaires) were evaluated. Subjects also recorded morning, afternoon and evening dry eye symptoms in a diary on each day of the trial.

&#160; 

Signs 

&#160;

The low dose treatment group of the EGP-437 Combination Product when compared to placebo demonstrated on a statistically significant basis less lissamine green corneal staining pre- to post-CAE at visit 5 in the superior region (p = 0.039). Statistically significant improvements in TFBUT were also observed for the low dose treatment group of the EGP-437 Combination Product relative to placebo at visit 5 pre- and post-CAE (p = 0.034, 0.049, respectively) and at visit 7 (p = 0.042). Statistically significant improvements in OPI were also observed for the low dose treatment relative to placebo at visit 5 post-CAE (p = 0.048).

&#160;

At visit 7, statistically significant differences between the low dose treatment and placebo groups were documented, including TFBUT (p = 0.042). When comparing endpoints across the entire trial&#8217;s duration (&#8220;environmental&#8221;), for example, the changes in fluorescein staining from visit 1 pre-CAE to visit 7 fluorescein staining, a statistically significant decrease in the inferior region was revealed for the low dose treatment group over placebo (p = 0.038). Fluorescein staining in the inferior region is recognized as an important sign of dry eye disease, because this area represents a region specifically vulnerable to exacerbation by stress conditions, including those presented in the CAE model.

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Symptoms 

&#160;

The differences in the mean ocular discomfort scores (for low dose treatment group of the EGP-437 Combination Product versus placebo) at several discrete time points during the visit 5 CAE exposure were statistically significant. In order to determine if the subjects reporting lower ocular discomfort scores during the visit 5 CAE experienced improvements in any relevant dry eye signs, two sub-groups of subjects were evaluated: those demonstrating ocular discomfort scores of &#60; 3 and those demonstrating ocular discomfort scores &#60; 4 at all time points between 50 and 90 minutes during visit 5 CAE exposure. Interestingly, the visit 6 and 7 data for subjects in the sub-group scoring &#60; 4 at all time points between 50 and 90 minutes during visit 5 CAE exposure demonstrated significantly longer mean TFBUTs for both active treatment groups compared to the placebo group. In addition, ocular discomfort at visits 4 and 6 was statistically significantly lower in the low dose treatment group versus placebo (p = 0.032 and p = 0.0032, respectively).

&#160;

In this exploratory study, the EGP-437 Combination Product suggested potential improvements in a variety of signs and symptoms of dry eye relative to placebo. Some positive effects were observed within 24 hours of treatment and over the three-week study period, which suggest a rapid onset of action and the potential for long-term effectiveness. Since multiple statistically significant observations were made across a variety of visits and endpoints, it appears that the effects are treatment related (i.e., the probability of incorrectly identifying statistical significance via the undefined level of 0.05). Based on all endpoints analyzed, it appears that the lower dose is more beneficial than the higher dose.

&#160;

Dry Eye: Phase 3 Trial 

&#160;

The Phase 3 trial design is similar to the Phase 2 trial design. However, the Phase 2 trial comprised seven visits conducted over three weeks while the Phase 3 trial comprised nine visits conducted over nine weeks. The Phase 3 trial was intended to confirm and extend the results from the Phase 2 trial. The Phase 3 trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the EGP-437 Combination Product under conditions of 4.0 mA-min at 1.5 mA (low dose treatment group) and 6.5 mA-min at 2.5 mA (high dose treatment group) compared to ocular iontophoresis with placebo for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye. There were 198 subjects enrolled in the trial with 66 subjects assigned to the low dose treatment group, 66 subjects assigned to high dose treatment group, and 66 subjects were assigned to the placebo group.

&#160;

This was a multi-center, randomized, double masked, placebo-controlled study which comprised nine visits conducted over approximately nine weeks using the CAE chamber. The CAE chamber was used at visit 1 (Day -7), visit 2 (Day 0), and visit 4 (Day +7) to reproducibly exacerbate dry eye signs and symptoms in a subject population selected for evidence of ongoing moderate to severe dry eye disease. Each subject received two sessions of iontophoresis (both eyes treated in each session): the first at 60 minutes after the CAE exposure at visit 2, and the second at 60 minutes before the CAE exposure at visit 4. Visits 3 and 5 took place 24 hours after visits 2 and 4, respectively, as follow-up evaluations. Visits 7, 8, and 9, took place on days 21, 28, and 56, respectively, and served to evaluated duration of action and long-term safety. At all visits (both pre- and post-CAE at visits 1, 2 and 4), dry eye signs (corneal and conjunctival staining, conjunctival redness, TFBUT, blink rate, ocular protection index (OPI), and corneal sensitivity) and symptoms (ocular discomfort before, during, and after the CAE exposure, several symptom questionnaires) were evaluated. Subjects also recorded morning, afternoon, and evening dry eye symptoms in a diary on each day of the study.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The study design allowed the effectiveness of the EGP-437 Combination Product to be assessed in different clinical scenarios: treatment, the effects of the EGP-437 Combination Product following the CAE-induced dry eye signs and symptoms; prevention, the effects of the EGP-437 Combination Product prior to the CAE-induced dry eye signs and symptoms; recovery, the effects of the EGP-437 Combination Product on the recovery towards baseline at 24 hours and 7 days post-CAE; and Environmental, the ability of the EGP-437 Combination Product to improve baseline dry eye signs and symptoms over the study period. Improvements in the EGP-437 Combination Product treatment groups relative to the placebo group at the 24-hour follow-up visits (visits 3 and 5), or post-CAE at visit 4, would be evidence of a rapid onset of action. Improvements relative to the placebo group pre-CAE at visit 4 or at visit 6 through visit 9 would be interpreted as evidence of a long duration of action.

&#160; 

Signs 

&#160;

Although, statistical significance was not met for the primary endpoint for a sign, which was fluorescein staining of the inferior region of the cornea at visit 6 (day 14), statistical significance for the high dose treatment group relative to the placebo group was demonstrated at visit 3 and for change from baseline to visit 3 (p=0.0366 and p=0.0084 respectively). Fluorescein staining of the total cornea at visit 3 and for change in baseline to visit 3 was also statistically significant with p=0.05 for both. Other signs also showed statistical significance at various visits, including lissamine green staining, conjunctival redness and TFBUT.

&#160;

Conjunctival Redness Time Point &#160; p-value &#160; Visit 3 &#160; &#160; 0.0004 &#160; Visit 3 Change from baseline &#160; &#160; 0.0038 &#160; Visit 4: Post CAE &#160; &#160; 0.0077 &#160; Visit 4: Change from pre CAE to post CAE &#160; &#160; 0.0080 &#160; &#160; 

Symptoms 

&#160;

Although the primary endpoint for symptom of ocular discomfort at visit 5 (Day 8) compared to placebo was not statistically significant, the ocular discomfort score at visit 4 showing the change from 0 to 90 minutes while in the CAE was statistically significant for both the low and high treatment dose groups as compared to the placebo group (p=0.0003 and p=&#60;0.0001 respectively). Also, the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) was statistically significant for the low dose treatment group as compared to placebo at visit 4 and visit 6 for change from baseline (p=0.0266 and p=0.0247 respectively). Other symptoms also showed statistical significance at various visits, including a 4 symptom questionnaire and the diary data assessing dryness.

&#160;

Questionnaire: Burning Time Point &#160; p-value &#160; Visit 4 Change from baseline &#160; &#160; 0.0034 &#160; Visit 7 Change from baseline &#160; &#160; 0.0130 &#160; Visit 8 Change from baseline &#160; &#160; 0.0181 &#160; &#160;

The improvements documented in dry eye signs and symptoms relative to the placebo group indicate that the treatments with the EGP-437 Combination Product had both a rapid onset of action and a long-term effectiveness.

&#160;

Rapid Onset: Statistically significant improvements for the following endpoints were noted at a 24-hour follow-up visit (visit 3 or visit 5), or post-CAE at visit 4, and are interpreted as evidence for a rapid onset of action.

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Fluorescein staining (inferior, superior, temporal, corneal sum, conjunctival sum) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Lissamine green staining (inferior, nasal, total sum) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Conjunctival redness &#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; TFBUT &#160;

&#160; &#8226; 4-Symptom questionnaire (burning, dryness, grittiness) &#160;

Long-term Effectiveness: The EGP-437 Combination Product treatment groups showed statistically significant improvements over the placebo group in the following endpoints pre-CAE at visit 4, at visits 6, 7, 8, or 9, or in the changes from baseline to visits 6, 7, 8, or 9, and are interpreted as evidence for a long duration of action.

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Fluorescein staining (nasal conjunctival region) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Lissamine green staining (nasal, temporal conjunctival, corneal sum, conjunctival sum) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Conjunctival redness &#160;

&#160; &#8226; 4-Symptom questionnaire (burning, stinging) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; OSDI Questionnaire &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Diary data (dryness) &#160;

The 24-hr follow-up visits evaluate the effectiveness of the EGP-437 Combination Product in treatment mode (visit 3) or in prevention mode (visit 5). Improvements observed in dry eye signs (corneal staining, conjunctival staining and conjunctival redness) at visits 3 and 5, and in the changes from baseline to visits 3 or 5, demonstrate that the two EGP-437 Combination Product treatments may aid healing in these regions.

&#160;

The improvements in dry eye symptoms (burning, stinging, dryness) demonstrated at visit 6, 7, 8, or 9, and in the changes from baseline to visits 6, 7, 8, or 9, demonstrate that the 2 EGP-437 Combination Product treatments have a long duration of action in relief of these symptoms.

&#160;

Clinical Development Plan &#160;

&#160;

We have completed two trials (Phase 1/2 and Phase 3) for anterior uveitis and have demonstrated in the completed Phase 3 non-inferiority study that two iontophoretic treatments with our EGP-437 Combination Product achieved the same response rate as the positive control for the primary efficacy endpoint, a complete clearing of anterior chamber cells, by day 14. This was achieved with a lower incidence of increased IOP, which is characterized as an increase of six mm Hg or more from baseline. The FDA has provided guidance that if the planned confirmatory Phase 3 trial of EGP-437 in anterior uveitis meets non-inferiority criteria, data from this trial along with data from our previously completed Phase 3 trial in anterior uveitis will be sufficient to support an NDA filing. The FDA also communicated that the design of the planned confirmatory Phase 3 anterior uveitis trial is acceptable and that the nonclinical work completed to date is sufficient to support an NDA filing.

&#160;

We have reported interim data for a Phase 1b/2a trial treating patients with macular edema using the EGP-437 Combination Product. This open-label, 20 patient trial treated patients with macular edema secondary to RVO, Diabetic Retinopathy and Vitrectomy Surgery. We have initiated the extension of this trial and estimate that we will have top-line data in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have completed a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of inflammation post cataract surgery. In this exploratory study we utilized the EGP-437 Combination Product in a prophylactic manner, by providing the treatment one day prior to the surgery. Unfortunately, the surgical procedure appears to eliminate or wash out any remaining drug product from the anterior segment of the eye where the ocular tissue that becomes inflamed postsurgery is located.We have recently filed a protocol and have initiated a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the treatment of inflammation post cataract surgery treating patients post-surgery. The design of this trial is based on treating the patients post-surgery and not prophylactically. We estimate that we will have top-line data in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

We have completed two trials (Phase 2 and Phase 3) for dry eye and have demonstrated significant improvements in a variety of signs and symptoms of dry eye relative to placebo. Dry eye is a syndrome with many different etiologies and with a pathology that is multifactorial making it difficult to enroll a homogenous group of patients for a trial, hence why we used the CAE system. We believe that dry eye fulfills our criteria and will be one of the indications on our priority list for further development. If we move forward with another trial for dry eye, we will seek an alternative way to determine eligibility for enrollment, without the assistance of the CAE system.

&#160;

Easy-to-Use Ocular Delivery System 

&#160;

The EGP-437 Combination Product utilizes a proprietary transscleral iontophoresis delivery system, the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System, which was originally designed at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami. Through animal studies and eventually a proof-of-concept clinical study in humans the original prototype was optimized and ultimately became the Eyegate&#174; II Delivery System. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System. The system utilizes a low electrical current to deliver a specified amount of drug for each treatment. The system used in clinical trials consists of: a reusable battery-powered generator, a disposable applicator kit and a vial that contains the drug. Over 1,700 experimental treatments have been performed with the system with more than 1,000 of these experimental treatments delivering the EGP-437 Combination Product during the development program.

&#160;

The EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System consists of the following key components:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; An applicator kit that includes: &#160;

&#160; &#186; An applicator used to deliver the drug product to the eye; &#160;

&#160; &#186; A syringe and adapter transfer system for transferring the drug product from a vial to the applicator; and &#160;

&#160; &#186; A return electrode to complete the continuous current circuit; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; A vial containing the drug product; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; A generator that provides a constant current to the electrode of the applicator. &#160;

These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.

&#160;

In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from such individual&#8217;s work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed by a consultant for us.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have entered into an exclusive global License Agreement with a subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (&#8220;Valeant&#8221;), through which EyeGate has granted Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to its EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product (&#34;Product&#34;) in the field of uveitis, as well as a right of last negotiation to license the Product for other indications.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We do not have, and do not intend to establish an in-house manufacturing capability for our products and as a result we will depend heavily on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package our products. We currently do not have any contractual relationships with third-party manufacturers. We intend to rely on third-party suppliers that we have used in the past for the manufacturing of various components that comprise our EGP-437 Combination Product that will be used in our confirmatory Phase 3 trial and other contemplated clinical trials.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

&#160;

Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

&#160;

The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

&#160;

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors&#8217; establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products currently being used for the indications that we may pursue, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our competitors in the treatment of non-infectious anterior uveitis include Durezol&#174; (Novartis AG), Lotemax&#174; (Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.), Pred Forte&#174; (Allergan, Inc.) and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (1%) (Novartis AG).

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

FDA Approval Process 

&#160;

In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

&#160;

FDA approval is required before any new drug, can be marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulation; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, which must be accepted for filing by the FDA; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; payment of user fees, if applicable; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA. &#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.

&#160;

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

&#160;

Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 1: The product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 2: The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. &#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

&#160;

According to section 505 of the FDCA, there are three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the entity that performed the studies (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). We intend to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA for our EGP-437 Combination Product.

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its NDA. Using this approval pathway may allow us to rely in part on information in the public domain to support the safety and effectiveness of EGP-437. The FDA may also require sponsors to perform additional clinical trials, measurements, or other types of studies or assessments (e.g., bridging studies) to support any change from the previously approved product. The review process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.

&#160;

To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents listed for the approved product on which the application relies in the FDA&#8217;s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly referred to as the Orange Book). Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product&#8217;s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the unchallenged listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not accept or approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for submission by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Moreover, in cases where a 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during a previously approved drug&#8217;s five year exclusivity period, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the 30 month stay will not prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application.

&#160;

Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA&#8217;s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit.

&#160;

In the NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.

&#160;

Combination Product Regulations 

&#160;

Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices may be regulated as &#8220;combination products&#8221; in the U.S. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic, or drug/biologic. Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. In order to facilitate premarket review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of both components. We expect that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research will have primary jurisdiction over out EGP-437 Combination Product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. We have had discussions with the FDA about the status of our EGP-437 Combination Product as a combination product and we have been told that the FDA considers our product a combination drug/device.

&#160;

We will be subject to regulations governing medical devices separate from those governing drugs. After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, however, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; product labeling regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses; &#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; corrections and removals (e.g., recalls); &#160;

&#160; &#8226; establishment registration and device listing; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; general prohibitions against the manufacture and distribution of adulterated and misbranded devices; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. &#160;

Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in civil fines, product seizures, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution of responsible individuals and us.

&#160; 

Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices 

&#160;

Medical devices, such as our EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System, may be evaluated either through the premarket approval, or PMA process, or the 510(k) clearance process, depending on the classification of the device. The regulatory classification for the Eyegate&#174; II Delivery System is defined under Code of Federations Regulations 21, Part 890, section 5525 (21 CFR 890.5525). The FDA has confirmed that the EyeGate&#174; II Delivery System will be submitted under the 510(k) clearance process. The FDA has further clarified the Code to state that an iontophoresis device intended for use with a specific drug that has been approved for delivery by iontophoresis is a class II device. The Eyegate&#174; II Delivery System will be indicated for use with a specific drug (EGP-437) that will be approved through the NDA process and therefore classified as a class II device. Gathering clinical evidence for devices is subject to FDA&#8217;s good clinical practice regulations, including requirements for IRB approval and informed consent. Significant risk devices require an approved investigational device exemption application before studies may begin. PMA approval typically requires, among other things, the submission of valid scientific evidence in the form of preclinical and clinical data, and a pre-approval inspection to determine if the manufacturing facility complies with cGMP practices under the quality system regulation that governs the design and all elements of the manufacture of devices. For clearance, a 510(k) must demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., must show that the device is as safe and effective as an already legally marketed device, also known as a predicate device. The evaluation of the newer device must not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than that of the predicate device. 510(k)s normally do not, but sometimes do, require clinical data for clearance.

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160;

&#160; &#8226; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels.

&#160; 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160;

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

&#160; 

Manufacturing Requirements 

&#160;

We and our third party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, extensive records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third party manufacturers and certain key component suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including untitled letters, warning letters, determinations of product adulteration, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. Such perceived problems concerning safety or efficacy may arise in the context of clinical studies continued as a result of our post-marketing obligations, reports we or FDA receive from patients and healthcare providers, or literature published by third parties regarding our products or similar products.

&#160; 

Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160;

Reimbursement is expected to use standard approaches for Ophthalmology with EGP-437 reimbursed as a physician-administered drug using a drug code (J-code) and the procedure reimbursed via a CPT code in addition to the standard reimbursement for office visits. The commercial success of our EGP-437 Combination Product and, if and when commercialized, our other product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors at the federal, state and private levels, including U.S. Government payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems.

&#160;

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to these initiatives and the trend toward managed healthcare and the increasing influence of managed care organizations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.

&#160;

Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our EGP-437 Combination Product and operate profitably.

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the applicable regulatory agency will have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160;
