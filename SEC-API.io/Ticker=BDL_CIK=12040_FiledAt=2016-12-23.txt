&#160;

History and Development of Our Business 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Florida in 1959 and commenced operating as a chain of small cocktail lounges and package liquor stores throughout South Florida. By 1970, we had established a chain of &#34;Big Daddy's&#34; lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970 to 1979, we expanded our package liquor store and lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other &#34;Sun Belt&#34; states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982 we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985 we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida area. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on page 7.

&#160;

During our fiscal year 1987, we began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 76.0% and bar sales approximately 24.0% of our total restaurant sales.

&#160;

Our package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants offer alcoholic beverages and full food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in a relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere.

&#160;

We conduct our operations directly and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below. Our subsidiaries and the limited partnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.

Package Liquor Store Operations 

&#160;

Our package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide selection of brand name and private label liquors, beer and wines while offering competitive pricing by meeting the published sales prices of our competitors. We provide sales training to our package liquor store personnel. The stores are open for business six or seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 9:00-10:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Approximately half of our units have &#34;night windows&#34; with extended evening hours.

&#160;

Company Owned Package Liquor Stores . We own and operate nine package liquor stores in the South Florida area under the name &#8220;Big Daddy&#8217;s Liquors&#8221;, four of which are jointly operated with restaurants we own.

&#160;

Franchised Package Liquor Stores . We currently franchise three package liquor stores, all in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name &#8220;Big Daddy&#8217;s Liquors&#8221; and are jointly operated with our franchisee&#8217;s restaurant operations. Two of the three remaining franchised package liquor stores are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee&#8217;s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee&#8217;s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, &#8220;Big Daddy&#8217;s Liquors&#8221;, franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 1% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales generated at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs.

&#160;

Restaurant Operations. 

&#160;

Our restaurants provide a neighborhood casual, standardized dining experience, typical of casual restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures. However, from time to time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost. Drink prices may vary between locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law.

&#160;

Company Owned Restaurants . We own and operate ten restaurants all under our service mark &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221; four of which are jointly operated with package liquor stores we own.

&#160;

Franchised Restaurants . We franchise five restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221;, two of which operate as a restaurant only and three of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated &#8220;Big Daddy&#8217;s Liquors&#8221; package liquor store.

&#160;

Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee&#8217;s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee&#8217;s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221;, our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 3% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales from the restaurants depending upon our actual advertising costs.

&#160;

For accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees&#8217; operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive are &#8220;earned&#8221; when sales are made by franchisees.

&#160;

Restaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited Partnerships 

&#160;

We have invested with others, (some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in nine limited partnerships which currently own and operate nine South Florida based restaurants under our service mark &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221;. In addition to being a limited partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of eight of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of these restaurants. We are only a limited partner in the limited partnership which owns and operates the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

Generally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors&#8217; cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (&#189;) to us as a management fee and one-half (1/2) to the investors, (including us), pro-rata based on the investors&#8217; investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors, (including us), have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (&#189;) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one half (&#189;) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us), as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors&#8217; investment. As of October 1, 2016, limited partnerships owning five (5) restaurants, (Surfside, Florida, Kendall, Florida, West Miami, Florida, Pinecrest, Florida and Wellington, Florida locations), have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (&#189;) of the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to our receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221; service mark, which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3% fee is &#8220;earned&#8221; when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants under development in the future will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service mark &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221; using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.

&#160;

&#160;

Management Agreement for &#8220;The Whale&#8217;s Rib&#8221; Restaurant 

&#160;

Since January, 2006, we have managed &#8220;The Whale&#8217;s Rib&#8221;, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement. We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us. In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (&#189;) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant. For our fiscal years ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we generated $442,000 and $500,000 of revenue, respectively from providing these management services.

&#160;

For our fiscal years ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we generated $150,000 and $163,000 of revenue, respectively, from the operation of the club.

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Operations and Management 

&#160;

We emphasize systematic operations and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants and generally assuring that the unit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by supervisors, who visit units to provide on-site management and support. There are three supervisors responsible for package liquor store operations and five supervisors responsible for restaurant operations.

&#160;

All of our managers and salespersons receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or &#34;shoppers&#34;, to inspect each unit in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions.

&#160;

Purchasing and Inventory 

&#160;

The package liquor business requires a constant substantial capital investment in inventory in the units. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same. Liquor inventory purchased can normally be returned only if defective or broken.

&#160;

All of our purchases of liquor inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing of an order. Frequently there is only one wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. Under Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor purchases within ten days of delivery.

&#160;

Negotiations with food suppliers are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by the restaurant's general manager before orders are placed. Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed several times a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly.

12&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. In particular, our operations are subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, alcoholic beverage control, safety and fire department agencies in the state or municipality where our units are located.

&#160;

Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants and package liquor stores to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages from a state authority and in certain locations, county and municipal authorities.

&#160;

In Florida, where all of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located, most of our liquor licenses are issued on a &#34;quota license&#34; basis. Quota licenses are issued on the basis of a population count established from time to time under the latest applicable census. Because the total number of liquor licenses available under a quota license system is limited and restrictions are placed upon their transfer, the licenses have purchase and resale value based upon supply and demand in the particular areas in which they are issued. The quota licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on and off premises consumption. In Florida, the other liquor licenses held by us or limited partnerships of which we are the general partner are restaurant liquor licenses, which do not have quota restrictions and no purchase or resale value. A restaurant liquor license is issued to every applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements, including, but not limited to zoning and minimum restaurant size, seating and menu. The restaurant liquor licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on premises consumption only.

&#160;

In the State of Georgia, where our adult entertainment club is located, licensed establishments also do not have quota restrictions for on-premises consumption and such licenses are issued to any applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements based upon extensive license application filings and investigations of the applicant.

&#160;

All licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Suspension or revocation may result from violation by the licensee or its employees of any federal, state or local law regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our units, including, minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operations, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages, internal control and accounting and collection of state alcoholic beverage taxes.

&#160;

As the sale of alcoholic beverages constitutes a large share of our revenue, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our operations in that location and could impair our ability to obtain licenses elsewhere.

13&#160;

&#160;

During our fiscal years 2016 and 2015, no significant pending matters have been initiated concerning any of our licenses which might be expected to result in a revocation of a liquor license or other significant actions against us.

&#160;

We are subject to &#8220;dram-shop&#8221; statutes due to our restaurant operations and club ownership. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry. Although we are covered by insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime. Significant numbers of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal or Florida minimum wage, whichever is higher, and accordingly, increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans With Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), which, among other things, may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements. The cost of any such renovations is not expected to materially affect us.

&#160;

We are not aware of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation under present consideration which would significantly limit or restrict our business as now conducted. However, in view of the number of jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and the highly regulated nature of the liquor business, there can be no assurance that additional limitations may not be imposed in the future, even though none are presently anticipated.

&#160;

General Liability Insurance 

&#160;

We have general liability insurance which incorporates a semi-self-insured plan under which we assume the full risk of the first $50,000 of exposure per occurrence, while the limited partnerships assume the full risk of the first $10,000 of exposure per occurrence. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our self-insured deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. During our fiscal year 2016 we were able to purchase excess liability insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $6,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. With the exception of one (1) limited partnership which has higher general liability insurance coverage to comply with the terms of its lease for the business premises, we are un-insured against liability claims in excess of $7,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.

&#160;

Our general policy is to settle only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable claims. We have established a group of defense attorneys which we use in conjunction with this program. Under our current liability insurance policy, any expense incurred by us in defending a claim, including adjusters and attorney's fees, are a part of our $50,000 or $10,000, as applicable, self-insured retentions.

&#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

In accordance with accounting guidance, we accrue for any self-insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, our annual self-insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change. Our self-insured accruals are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the caption &#34;Accounts payable and accrued expenses&#34;. A significant unfavorable judgment or settlement against us in excess of our liability insurance coverage could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

Property Insurance; Windstorm Insurance; Deductibles 

&#160;

For the policy year beginning December 30, 2015, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy with an unaffiliated third party insurance carrier, including coverage for properties leased by us and our consolidated limited partnerships, and provides for full insurance coverage for property losses, including those caused by windstorm, such as a hurricane. We are in discussions to secure property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy. For property losses caused by windstorm, the property insurance has fixed deductibles per location, per occurrence. For all other property losses, the property insurance has deductibles of $10,000 per location, per occurrence. The one (1) year property insurance premium is in the amount of $504,000, of which $404,000 is financed through an unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement provides that we are obligated to repay the amount financed, together with interest at the rate of 2.95% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of approximately $41,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security interest in the insurance policy, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.

Competition and the Company's Market 

&#160;

The liquor and hospitality industries are highly competitive and are often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among package liquor stores is price and that, in general, the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served.

&#160;

Our package liquor stores compete directly or indirectly with local retailers and discount &#34;superstores&#34;. Due to the competitive nature of the liquor industry in South Florida, we have had to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, including meeting all competitors&#8217; advertisements. Such practices will continue in the package liquor business. We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the &#34;Big Daddy's Liquors&#34; name.

&#160;

Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned. Due to the competitive nature of the hospitality industry, we have limited our menu price increases. In February 2016, we increased certain menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our total bar revenues of approximately 3.0% annually and we also increased certain restaurant menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our total food revenues of approximately 3.7% annually. During our fiscal year 2015 we did not raise our menu prices, nor did we raise our bar prices. We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the &#34;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#34; name.

&#160;

15&#160;

&#160;

We have many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, with substantially greater financial resources than we do. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel.

&#160;

Our business is subject to seasonal effects, including that liquor purchases tend to increase during the holiday seasons.

&#160;

Trade Names 

&#160;

We operate our package liquor stores and restaurants under two service marks; &#34;Big Daddy's Liquors&#34; and &#34;Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill&#34;, both of which are federally registered trademarks owned by us. Our right to the use of the &#34;Big Daddy's&#34; service mark is set forth under a consent decree of a Federal Court entered into by us in settlement of federal trademark litigation. The consent decree and the settlement agreement allow us to continue to use and to expand our use of the &#34;Big Daddy's&#8221; service mark in connection with our package liquor sales in Florida, while restricting future liquor sales in Florida under the &#34;Big Daddy's&#34; name by the other party who has a federally registered service mark for &#34;Big Daddy's&#34; use in the restaurant business. The Federal Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree. We have acquired registered Federal trademarks on the principal register for our &#34;Flanigan's&#34; and &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s Seafood Bar and Grill&#8221; service marks.

&#160;

The standard symbolic trademark associated with our facilities and operations is the bearded face and head of &#34;Big Daddy&#34; which is predominantly displayed at all &#34;Flanigan's&#34; facilities and all &#34;Big Daddy's&#34; facilities throughout the country. The face comprising this trademark is that of the Company&#8217;s founder, Joseph &#34;Big Daddy&#34; Flanigan, and is a federally registered trademark owned by us.

Flanigan&#8217;s 401(k) Plan 

&#160;

Effective July 1, 2004, we began sponsoring a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute elective deferrals to the plan up to amounts allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. We are not required to contribute to the plan but may make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions. During our fiscal years ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Board of Directors approved discretionary matching contributions totaling $43,000 and $35,000, respectively.
