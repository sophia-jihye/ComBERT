ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) &#160; 

Management of the Company uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of the Company. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. NJRES &#32;economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. 

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE:

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) &#160; 

Natural Gas Distribution 

General 

NJNG provides natural gas service to approximately 521,200 &#32;customers. NJNG&#8217;s service territory includes New Jersey&#8217;s Monmouth and Ocean counties and parts of Burlington, Morris and Middlesex counties. It encompasses 1,516 &#32;square miles, covering 105 &#32;municipalities with an estimated population of 1.5 million &#32;people. It is primarily suburban, highlighted by approximately 100 miles of New Jersey coastline. It is in close proximity to New York City, Philadelphia and the metropolitan areas of northern New Jersey and is accessible through a network of major roadways and mass transportation. 

NJNG added 8,170 &#32;and 7,858 &#32;new customers in fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively, and added natural gas heat and other services to another 644 &#32;and 636 &#32;existing customers in fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. NJNG expects its new customer annual growth rate to continue to be approximately 1.6 percent &#32;with projected additions in the range of approximately 24,000 to 27,000 &#32;new customers over the next three years. This anticipated customer growth represents approximately $5 million &#32;in new annual utility gross margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as calculated under NJNG&#8217;s CIP tariff. 

When assessing the potential for future growth in its service area, NJNG uses information derived from county and municipal planning boards that describes housing developments in various stages of approval. Furthermore, NJNG surveys builders in its service area to gain insight into future development plans. NJNG has periodically engaged outside consultants to assist in its customer growth projections. In addition to customer growth through new construction, NJNG&#8217;s business strategy includes aggressively pursuing conversions from other fuels, such as oil, electricity and propane. NJNG estimates that during fiscal 2017 , approximately 48 percent &#32;of NJNG&#8217;s projected customer growth will consist of conversions. 

NJNG&#8217;s business is subject to various risks, such as those associated with adverse economic conditions, which can negatively impact customer growth, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices, which can impact customer usage, customer conservation efforts, certain regulatory actions and environmental remediation. It is often difficult to predict the impact of trends associated with these risks. NJNG employs strategies to manage the challenges it faces, including pursuing customer conversions from other fuel sources and monitoring new construction markets through contact with developers, utilizing incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce gas costs, pursuing rate and other regulatory strategies designed to stabilize and decouple gross margin, and working actively with consultants and the NJDEP to manage expectations related to its obligations associated with its former MGP sites.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) &#160; 

Seasonality of Gas Revenues 

Therm sales are significantly affected by weather conditions with customer demand being greatest during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. The relative measurement of the impact of weather is in degree-days. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day&#8217;s average temperature. A degree-day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day. Normal heating degree-days are based on a 20-year average, calculated based on three reference areas representative of NJNG&#8217;s service territory. 

The CIP, a mechanism authorized by the BPU, stabilizes NJNG&#8217;s utility gross margin, regardless of variations in weather. In addition, the CIP decouples the link between utility gross margin and customer usage, allowing NJNG to promote energy conservation measures. Recovery of utility gross margin is subject to additional conditions, including an earnings test, a revenue test and an evaluation of BGSS-related savings achieved over a 12-month period. In May 2014 , the BPU approved the continuation of the CIP program with no expiration date; however, the program will be subject to review in a future CIP rate filing in fiscal 2017. 

Concurrent with its annual BGSS filing, NJNG files for an annual review of its CIP, during which time it can request rate changes, as appropriate. For additional information regarding the CIP, including rate actions and impact to margin, see Note 3. Regulation &#32;in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7. Management &#8217; s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Natural Gas Distribution Segment . 

Gas Supply 

Firm Natural Gas Supplies 

In fiscal 2016 , NJNG purchased natural gas from approximately 80 &#32;suppliers under contracts ranging from one day to one year and purchased over 10 percent of its natural gas from one &#32;supplier. NJNG believes the loss of this supplier would not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows as an adequate number of alternative suppliers exist. NJNG believes that its supply strategy should adequately meet its expected firm load over the next several years. 

Firm Transportation and Storage Capacity 

NJNG maintains agreements for firm transportation and storage capacity with several interstate pipeline companies to take delivery of firm natural gas supplies, which ensures the ability to reliably service its customers. NJNG receives natural gas at 10 &#32;citygate stations located in Middlesex, Morris and Passaic counties in New Jersey. 

The pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to NJNG&#8217;s citygate stations, the maximum daily deliverability of that capacity for the upcoming winter season and the contract expiration dates are as follows:

NJNG utilizes its transportation contracts to transport gas from the Dominion Transmission Corporation, Steckman Ridge and Central New York Oil &#38; Gas storage fields to NJNG&#8217;s citygates. NJNG has sufficient firm transportation, storage and supply capacity to fully meet its firm sales contract obligations. 

Citygate Supplies from NJRES 

NJNG has several citygate supply agreements with NJRES. NJNG and NJRES have an agreement where NJNG releases 10,000 &#32;Dths/day of Texas Eastern Transmission capacity, 2,200 &#32;Dths/day of Dominion Transmission capacity, 10,728 &#32;Dths/day of Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity and 1.6 million &#32;Dths of Central New York Oil &#38; Gas storage capacity to NJRES for the period of April 1, 2016 &#32;to March 31, 2017 . NJNG can call upon a supply of up to 20,000 &#32;Dths/day delivered to NJNG&#8217;s Texas Eastern citygate. NJRES manages the storage inventory and NJNG can call on that storage supply as needed at NJNG&#8217;s Tennessee citygate or storage point. 

NJNG also has agreements where it releases 80,000 &#32;Dths/day of its Texas Eastern Transmission capacity to NJRES for the period of April 1, 2016 &#32;to March 31, 2018 . Under these agreements, NJNG can call upon a supply of up to 80,000 &#32;Dths/day delivered to its Texas Eastern citygate as needed. See Note 15. Related Party Transactions &#32;in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these transactions. 

Peaking Supply 

To manage its winter peak day demand, NJNG maintains two LNG facilities with a combined deliverability of approximately 170,000 &#32;Dths/day, which represents approximately 19 percent &#32;of its estimated peak day sendout. In June 2016, NJNG&#8217;s liquefaction facility became operational and allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill NJNG&#8217;s existing LNG storage tanks. See Item 2. Properties-Natural Gas Distribution Segment &#32;for additional information regarding the LNG storage facilities. 

BGSS 

BGSS is a BPU-approved clause designed to allow for the recovery of natural gas commodity costs on an annual basis. The clause requires all New Jersey natural gas utilities to make an annual filing by each June 1 for review of BGSS rates and to request a potential rate change effective the following October 1. The BGSS is also designed to allow each natural gas utility to provisionally increase residential and small commercial customer BGSS rates on December 1 and February 1 for up to a five percent increase to the average residential heat customer&#8217;s bill on a self-implementing basis, after proper notice and BPU action on the June filing. Such increases are subject to subsequent BPU review and final approval. Decreases in the BGSS rate and BGSS refunds can be implemented with five days&#8217; notice to the BPU. 

In addition to making periodic rate adjustments to reflect changes in commodity prices, NJNG is also permitted to refund or credit back a portion of the commodity costs to customers when the natural gas commodity costs decrease in comparison to amounts projected or to amounts previously collected from customers. Rate changes, as well as other regulatory actions related to BGSS, are discussed further in Note 3. Regulation &#32;in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Page 9 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 

Part I 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) &#160; 

Wholesale natural gas prices are, by their nature, volatile. NJNG mitigates the impact of volatile price changes on customers through the use of financial derivative instruments, which were part of its FRM program, its storage incentive program and its BGSS clause. The FRM program was terminated effective November 1, 2015 . 

Future Natural Gas Supplies 

NJNG expects to meet the natural gas requirements for existing and projected firm customers into the foreseeable future. If NJNG&#8217;s long-term natural gas requirements change, NJNG expects to renegotiate and restructure its contract portfolio to better match the changing needs of its customers and changing natural gas supply landscape. 

Regulation and Rates 

State 

NJNG is subject to the jurisdiction of the BPU with respect to a wide range of matters such as base rates and regulatory rider rates, the issuance of securities, the adequacy of service, the manner of keeping its accounts and records, the sufficiency of natural gas supply, pipeline safety, environmental issues, compliance with affiliate standards and the sale or encumbrance of its properties. On November 13, 2015 , NJNG filed a base rate petition with the BPU to increase its base rates in the amount of $147.6 million . On July 20, 2016 , an update was filed to include twelve months of actual financial information, which revised the requested base rates increase to $112.9 million . On September 23, 2016 , the BPU approved an increase to base rates in the amount of $45 million , effective October 1, 2016 . 

See Note 3. Regulation &#32;in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding NJNG&#8217;s rate proceedings. 

Federal 

FERC regulates rates charged by interstate pipeline companies for the transportation and storage of natural gas. This affects NJNG&#8217;s agreements with several interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of such services. Costs associated with these services are currently recoverable through the BGSS. 

Competition 

Although its franchises are nonexclusive, NJNG is not currently subject to competition from other natural gas distribution utilities with regard to the transportation of natural gas in its service territory. Due to significant distances between NJNG&#8217;s current large industrial customers and the nearest interstate natural gas pipelines, as well as the availability of its transportation tariff, NJNG currently does not believe it has significant exposure to the risk that its distribution system will be bypassed. Competition does exist from suppliers of oil, coal, electricity and propane. At the present time, however, natural gas is used in over 95 percent of new construction due to its efficiency, reliability and price advantage. Natural gas prices are a function of market supply and demand. Although NJNG believes natural gas will remain competitive with alternate fuels, no assurance can be given in this regard. 

The BPU, within the framework of the EDECA, fully opened NJNG&#8217;s residential markets to competition, including third-party suppliers, and restructured rates to segregate its BGSS and delivery (i.e., transportation) prices. New Jersey&#8217;s natural gas utilities must provide BGSS in the absence of a third-party supplier. On September 30, 2016 , NJNG had 36,292 &#32;residential and 10,316 &#32;commercial and industrial customers utilizing the transportation service. 

Clean Energy Ventures 

NJRCEV is an unregulated company that invests in, owns and operates clean energy projects, including commercial and residential solar installations located in New Jersey, and wind farms located in Montana, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming and Pennsylvania. 

As of September 30, 2016 , NJRCEV has constructed in New Jersey, a total of 149.7 &#32;MW of solar capacity that has qualified for ITCs, including a combination of residential and commercial net-metered and grid-connected solar systems. As part of its solar investment program, NJRCEV operates a residential lease program, The Sunlight Advantage&#174;, which provides qualifying homeowners with the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home with no installation or maintenance expenses. NJRCEV owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the lease in exchange for monthly lease payments. In addition, certain qualified non-profit institutions are served under PPAs. The program is operated by NJRCEV using qualified contracting 

Page 10 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 

Part I 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) &#160; 

partners in addition to strategic suppliers for material standardization and sourcing. The residential solar lease and PPA market is highly competitive with various companies operating in New Jersey. NJRCEV competes on price, quality and brand reputation, leveraging its partner network and customer referrals. 

NJRCEV&#8217;s commercial solar projects are sourced through various channels and include both net-metered and grid-connected systems. Net-metered projects involve the sale of energy to a host and grid-connected systems into the wholesale energy markets. Project construction is competitively sourced through third parties. New Jersey has the fourth largest solar market in the U.S. with a large number of firms competing in all facets of the market including development, financing and construction. 

The solar systems are registered and certified with the BPU&#8217;s Office of Clean Energy and qualified to produce SRECs. One SREC is created for every MWh of electricity produced by a solar generator. NJRCEV sells the SRECs it generates to a variety of counterparties including electric load serving entities that serve electric customers in New Jersey and are required to comply with the solar carve-out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard. Solar projects are also currently eligible for federal ITCs in the year that they are placed into service. 

In addition to its solar investments, NJRCEV invests in small to mid-size onshore wind farms that fit its investment profile, including the following as of September 30, 2016 : 

&#8226; 

a $20.3 million , 9.7 &#32;MW project in Two Dot, Montana that was completed in June 2014; 

&#8226; 

a $42.1 million , 20 &#32;MW project in Carroll County, Iowa that was completed in January 2015; 

&#8226; 

an $84.9 million , 50.7 &#32;MW project in Rush County, Kansas that was completed in December 2015; 

&#8226; 

a $3.7 million , 6.3 &#32;MW project in Carbon County, Wyoming, that was acquired in August 2016; and 

&#8226; 

an $84 million , 39.9 &#32;MW project in Somerset County, Pennsylvania that is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

The wind projects are &#32;eligible for &#32;PTCs for a 10-year period following commencement of operations and have long-term PPAs of various terms in place, which typically govern the sale of energy, capacity and/or renewable energy credits. 

NJRCEV is subject to various risks including those associated with adverse federal and state legislation and regulatory policies, construction delays that can impact the timing or eligibility of tax incentives, technological changes, and the future market of SRECs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;for additional information regarding these risks. 

Energy Services 

NJRES is an unregulated wholesale provider of natural gas and also provides producer and asset management services to a diverse customer base across North America. NJRES has acquired contractual rights to natural gas storage and transportation assets it utilizes to implement its strategic and opportunistic market strategies. The rights to these assets were acquired in anticipation of delivering natural gas, performing asset management services for customers or in conjunction with identifying strategic opportunities that exist in or between the market areas that it serves. These opportunities are driven by price differentials between market locations and/or time periods. NJRES&#8217; activities are conducted in the market areas in which it has strong expertise, including the U.S. and Canada. NJRES differentiates itself in the marketplace based on price, reliability and quality of service. Its competitors include wholesale marketing and trading companies, utilities, natural gas producers and financial institutions. NJRES&#8217; portfolio of customers includes regulated natural gas distribution companies, industrial companies, electric generators, natural gas/liquids processors, retail aggregators, wholesale marketers and natural gas producers. 

While focusing on maintaining a low-risk operating and counterparty credit profile, NJRES&#8217; activities specifically consist of the following elements: 

&#8226;

Managing economic hedging programs that are designed to mitigate the impact of changes in market prices on financial margin generated on its natural gas storage and transportation commitments. 

In fiscal 2016 , NJRES purchased over 10 percent of its natural gas from one &#32;supplier. NJRES believes the loss of this supplier would not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows as an adequate number of alternative suppliers exist. 

Transportation and Storage Transactions 

NJRES focuses on creating value from the use of its physical assets, which are typically amassed through contractual rights to natural gas storage and transportation capacity. These assets become more valuable when favorable price changes occur that impact the value between or within market areas and across time periods. On a forward basis, NJRES may hedge these price differentials through the use of financial instruments. In addition, NJRES may seek to optimize these assets on a daily basis, as market conditions warrant, by evaluating natural gas supply and transportation availability within its portfolio. This enables NJRES to capture geographic pricing differences across various regions as delivered natural gas prices may change favorably as a result of market conditions. NJRES may, for example, initiate positions when intrinsic financial margin is present, and then enhance that financial margin as prices change across regions or time periods. 

NJRES also engages in park-and-loan transactions with storage and pipeline operators, where NJRES will either borrow (receive a loan of) natural gas with an obligation to repay the storage or pipeline operator at a later date or &#8220;park&#8221; natural gas with an obligation to withdraw at a later date. In these cases, NJRES evaluates the economics of the transaction to determine if it can capture pricing differentials in the marketplace and generate financial margin. NJRES evaluates deal attributes such as fixed fees, calendar spread value from deal inception until volumes are scheduled to be returned and/or repaid, as well as the time value of money. If this evaluation demonstrates that financial margin exists, NJRES may enter into the transaction and hedge with natural gas futures contracts, thereby locking in financial margin. 

NJRES maintains inventory balances to satisfy existing or anticipated sales of natural gas to its counterparties and/or to create additional value, as described above. During fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , NJRES managed and sold 551.1 &#32;Bcf and 626.9 &#32;Bcf of natural gas, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , NJRES had 62 &#32;Bcf or $130.5 million &#32;of gas in storage and 44.6 &#32;Bcf or $93.7 million &#32;of gas in storage, respectively. 

Weather/Seasonality 

NJRES&#8217; activities are typically seasonal in nature as a result of changes in the supply and demand for natural gas. Demand for natural gas is generally higher during the winter months when there may also be supply constraints; however, during periods of milder temperatures, demand can decrease. In addition, demand for natural gas can also be high during periods of extreme heat in the summer months, resulting from the need for additional natural gas supply for gas-fired electric generation facilities. Accordingly, NJRES can be subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. 

Volatility 

NJRES&#8217; activities are also subject to changes in price volatility or supply/demand dynamics within its wholesale markets, including in the Northeastern, Appalachian, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Changes in natural gas supply can affect capacity values and NJRES&#8217; financial margin, described below, that is generated from the optimization of transportation and storage assets. With its focus on risk management, NJRES continues to diversify its revenue stream by identifying new growth opportunities in producer and asset management services. NJRES has added new counterparties and strategic storage and transportation assets to its portfolio, which currently includes an average of approximately 43.7 &#32;Bcf of firm storage and 1.7 &#32;Bcf/day of firm transportation capacity. NJRES continues to expand its geographic footprint.

Financial Margin 

To economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with its existing and anticipated commitments for the purchase and sale of natural gas, NJRES enters into a variety of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures contracts, physical forward contracts, financial swaps and options. These derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. NJRES views &#8220;financial margin&#8221; as a key internal financial metric. NJRES&#8217; financial margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents revenues earned from the sale of natural gas less costs of natural gas sold including any storage and transportation costs, and excludes any accounting impact from changes in the fair value of certain derivative instruments. For additional information regarding financial margin, see Item 7. Management &#8217; s Discussion and Analysis &#32; of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Energy Services Segment . 

Risk Management 

In conducting its business, NJRES mitigates risk by following formal risk management guidelines, including transaction limits, segregation of duties and formal contract and credit review approval processes. NJRES continuously monitors and seeks to reduce the risk associated with its counterparty credit exposures. Accordingly, NJRES&#8217; counterparties are primarily investment grade rated companies. The Risk Management Committee of NJR oversees compliance with these established guidelines. 

Midstream 

Our Midstream segment includes investments in FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation and storage assets and is comprised of the following subsidiaries: 

&#8226; 

NJR Steckman Ridge Storage Company, which holds the Company&#8217;s 50 percent &#32;equity investment in Steckman Ridge. Steckman Ridge is a Delaware limited partnership, jointly owned and controlled by subsidiaries of the Company and subsidiaries of Spectra Energy Corporation, that built, owns and operates a natural gas storage facility with up to 12 &#32;Bcf of working gas capacity in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. The facility has direct access to the Texas Eastern and Dominion Transmission pipelines and has access to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets; 

&#8226; 

NJR Pipeline Company, which consists of its 20 percent &#32;equity investment in PennEast, through which NJR and five other investors expect to construct a 118 -mile FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline system that will extend from northern Pennsylvania to western New Jersey, which we estimate will be completed and operational by the first quarter of fiscal 2019 ; and 

&#8226; 

NJR Midstream Holdings Corporation, through its subsidiary, NJNR Pipeline Company, also held the Company&#8217;s 5.53 percent &#32;ownership interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission L.P. until &#32; September 29, 2015 , when NJNR Pipeline Company exchanged &#32;its ownership interest in Iroquois to Dominion Midstream Partners, L.P. for approximately 1.84 million &#32;DM Common Units.

ENVIRONMENT 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legislation and regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

NJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of five MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. NJNG periodically, and at least annually, performs an environmental review of the MGP sites, including a review of potential estimated liabilities related to the investigation and remedial action on these sites. Based on this review, NJNG estimated that the total future expenditures to remediate and monitor the five MGP sites for which it is responsible will range from approximately $143.9 million &#32;to $231.6 million . 

NJNG&#8217;s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known and measurable facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed in fiscal 2016. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG&#8217;s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. As of September 30, 2016 , NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $172 million &#32;on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents its most likely possible liability and recoverable regulatory asset; however, actual costs may differ from these estimates. On June 29, 2016 , the BPU approved NJNG&#8217;s December 2015 filing, which requested approval of its MGP expenditures incurred through June 30, 2015 , with recovery of $9.4 million &#32;annually related to the SBC RA factor with rates effective July 9, 2016 . NJNG will continue to seek recovery of these costs through its remediation rider. 

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 

As of September 30, 2016 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed 1,034 &#32;employees compared with 991 &#32;employees as of September 30, 2015 . Of the total number of employees, NJNG had 441 &#32;and 424 &#32;and NJRHS had 106 &#32;and 104 &#32;Union or &#8220;Represented&#8221; employees as of September 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. NJNG and NJRHS have collective bargaining agreements with the Union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, that expire in December 2018 &#32;and April 2019 , respectively. The labor agreements cover wage increases and other benefits, including the defined benefit pension (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012, with the exception of certain rehires who are eligible to resume active participation), the postemployment benefit plan (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012) and the enhanced 401(k) retirement savings plan. The Company considers its relationship with employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be in good standing.
