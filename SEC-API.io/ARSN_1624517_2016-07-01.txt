 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Corporate History; Change in Control 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in the Nevada on April 19, 2013. 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2015, the Company, Dong Gu Kang and Min Jung Kang, the principal stockholders of the Company (the &#8220;Selling Stockholders&#8221;), and Maverick, LLC, a Nevis limited liability company (&#8220;Maverick&#8221;), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the &#8220;Stock Purchase Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Maverick purchased an aggregate of 90,000,000 shares (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), of the Company from the Selling Stockholders in consideration for $0.001 per share, for a total purchase price of $6,000. The Shares represent approximately 71.17% of the 126,450,000 outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the transaction constituted a change in control of the Company. Maverick purchased the Shares by issuing each Selling Stockholder a non-interest bearing promissory note for his pro rata portion of the Shares. Both promissory notes are unsecured, mature December 30, 2016 and may be prepaid without penalty. Ester Barrios is the Managing Member of Maverick has voting and dispositive control over these securities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company, Selling Stockholders and Maverick entered into a debt assumption agreement (the &#8220;Debt Assumption Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Maverick assumed an aggregate of $24,656 in outstanding debt owed the Selling Stockholders by the Company; constituting 100% of the debt owed the Selling Stockholders of the Company. 

&#160; 

The Stock Purchase Agreement and Debt Assumption Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Selling Stockholders, Maverick and the Company. 

&#160; 

On September 17, 2015, the board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of the Company increased the size of the Board to three persons and appointed Mr. Tracy Fortner to fill the created vacancy. Directors serve for a period of one year until the next stockholders&#8217; meeting and until their respective successor is elected and qualifies. 

&#160; 

On September 17, 2015, Dong Gu Kang and Min Jung Kang resigned from the board of directors and as executive officers of the Company, effective immediately. Dong Gu Kang had been serving as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary of the Company. Min Jung Kang had been serving as the Treasurer of the Company. Their respective departures were not related to any issues regarding financial disclosures or accounting or legal matters. 

&#160; 

On September 17, 2015, the Board appointed Tracy Fortner as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. 

&#160; 

On November 25, 2015, we effected a fifteen-for-one (15:1) forward stock split (the &#8220;Forward Split&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock, without changing the authorized number or par value of the Common Stock and with fractional shares resulting from the Forward Split being rounded up to the nearest whole number. As a result of the Forward Split, the number of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock was increased from 8,430,000 to 126,450,000. Unless noted otherwise, all share amounts in this Annual Report reflect the Forward Split. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a startup mining exploration company without mining operations. Since our inception, we have not generated any revenues and at October 31, 2015, our net losses were $76,094. In their audit report included in this Annual Report, our auditors have expressed their doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have funded our operations by issuing equity and debt and our lack of capital has delayed the implementation of our business plan. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such capital on sufficient terms, if at all. 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and paid a total deposit of $15,000 for the Gold Creek Property comprising of one claim block of 11 claims or 220 acres, in Elko County, Nevada (the &#8220;Property&#8221;). The Property can be accessed via Nevada State Route #225 connecting to county road USFS Road #745) which provide access to the immediately adjacent Gold Creek Ranger Station. The nearest commercial airport is in Reno, approximately 260 road miles from the Property. The Gold Creek Property Agreement was entered into for the sum of $15,000, for a 100% interest in the Property. The claims were registered in the name of Gold Exploration Management Services, Inc. (&#8220;Gold Exploration&#8221;). On August 31, 2015, Gold Exploration&#8217;s title to the mining claims on the Property expired but has been re-staked by the Company. Due to the Land Freeze (as defined below) by the ILLM in 2015 of 10 million acres of public and National Forest System lands identified as Sagebrush Focal Areas in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming from location and entry under the United States mining laws to protect the greater sage-grouse, Gold Creek&#8217;s title to the mining claims on the Property were not able to be transferred into the Company&#8217;s name. The Company anticipates once the Land Freeze is lifted, of which there can be no assurances, Gold Exploration will apply to renew the claims and at that point the claims are expected to be transferred to the Company. There can be no assurances that the Land Freeze will be lifted or that if lifted, we will have sufficient funds to have the mining claims transferred into the Company&#8217;s name. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Gold Exploration Management Services, Inc. to provide us with a summary report about the mining claims, describes the mining claims, the regional geology, the mineral potential of the claim and recommendations how we should explore the claim. 

&#160; 

Land Freeze &#8211; Force Majeure 

&#160; 

As discussed more fully below under &#8220;Government Regulations and Regulations &#8211; Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation,&#8221; commencing in 2010, there has been heightened awareness of the conservation of the greater sage-grouse, the largest grouse found in North America currently inhabiting the sage-steppe ecosystems in Montana, southern Idaho, northeastern California, eastern Oregon, northwestern Colorado, and broader sections of Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. 

&#160; 

In 2014, Nevada adopted the Nevada Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Plan of 2014 (&#8220;2014 State Plan&#8221;), a sage-grouse conservation plan which provides broad goals, objectives, and management actions to ameliorate the primary threats to sage-grouse in Nevada. Nevada is also in the process of developing a Nevada Sage-Grouse Strategic Action Plan (&#8220;SAP&#8221;) which is expected to into greater detail and identify areas to focus conservation efforts in order to achieve the broad goals and objectives outlined in the 2014 State Plan. 

&#160; 

Also, on September 23, 2015, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management (&#8220;ILLM&#8221;) approved an application to withdraw ( i.e., prohibiting mining) approximately 10 million acres of public and National Forest System lands identified as Sagebrush Focal Areas in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming from location and entry under the United States mining laws to protect the greater sage-grouse and its habitat from adverse effects of locatable mineral exploration and mining, subject to valid existing rights (the &#8220;Land Freeze&#8221;). Comments on the proposed withdrawal application or scoping comments on issues to be analyzed in the Environmental Impact Statement must have been received by December 23, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Property is included in the approximately 10 million acres of land currently closed for mining exploration under the Land Freeze by the ILLM and being studied by Nevada in connection with SAP. Therefore, under this force majeure event, the Company is currently prohibited from conducting any mining activities on the Property and, depending on the outcomes of the ILLM&#8217;s Environmental Impact Statement and Nevada&#8217;s SAP, the Company may be permanently prohibited or restricted from conducting any activities on the Property. The Company intends, however, to pursue potential acquisitions of other land on which it may conduct mining activities. The Company is not currently a party to any oral or written agreement to purchase any land at this point in time. 

&#160; 

If and when we are permitted to conduct exploration activities on the Property, of which there can be no assurances, or any additional land we acquire, our goal is to assess whether our claim or claims possess any commercially viable mineral deposits by a four phase program. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Also, the Property is not, and any claims we may acquire will not be, accessible all year round. There are periods where our claims may be un-accessible each year due to snow in the area. This means that our exploration activities may be limited to a period of about eight to nine months per year. 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes the four phases of our anticipated exploration program on the Property and any claims we may acquire (assuming we are permitted to conduct mining activities). 

&#160; 

Phase: &#160; Planned Exploration Activities: &#160; Estimated Cost: &#160; PHASE I &#160; Preliminary Surface Sampling, Geological and Geochemical Screening. &#160; $ 9,500 &#160; PHASE II &#160; Detailed Evaluation, Geological Mapping, Site Prep, additional sampling &#160; $ 27,500 &#160; PHASE III &#160; Permitting and site preparation: drilling and environmental reclamation &#160; $ 67,144 &#160; PHASE IV &#160; Permitting and site preparation: drilling and environmental reclamation &#160; $ 248,930 &#160; &#160; &#160; TOTAL: &#160; $ 353,074.00 &#160; &#160; 

If our exploration activities indicate that there are no commercially viable mineral deposits on our mining claims, we will abandon the claims and stake or acquire new claims to explore. We will continue to stake and explore claims as long as we can afford to do so. 

&#160; 

Important Note: The following disclosure discusses the Property we placed a deposit on in October 2014 and assumes that we will be permitted to conduct exploration activities there, of which there can be no assurances. See &#8220;Land Freeze &#8211; Force Majeure&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors - Due to the Land Freeze, we are currently prohibited from conducting any activities on the Property, our sole asset &#8221; and &#8220; Due to the Land Freeze on the Property in 2015, we have been unable have the title to the mining claims on the Property transferred into the Company&#8217;s name. &#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Location and Means of Access to Our Mining Claims 

&#160; 

The Island Mountain Mining District, in which the Gold Creek prospect lies, occupies an area of about 22 square km in the northern portion of the Independence Mountain Range, 60 miles (97 km) north of Elko, Nevada, along Nevada State Route #225 connecting to county road USFS Road #745) which provide access to the immediately adjacent Gold Creek Ranger Station. 

&#160; 

Mining Claim Description 

&#160; 

The Gold Creek Property mining claims are currently expired and we hope to renew these claims if and when the land freeze is lifted. There are no third party conditions which affect the claims other than conditions defined by the State of Nevada as described below. The Property covers an area of 220 acres. We did not have insurance covering the claims. We believe that no insurance is necessary since the claims are unimproved and contain no buildings or improvements and contains no infrastructure on the claims. The claim numbers, previous registered owner number, expiration date, number of units, and work requirement as typically recorded in the State of Nevada is as follows:

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Gold Creek Property is located approximately 60 miles (97 km) North of Elko, Nevada, and 260 miles (418 km) northeast of Reno, Nevada, in the Island Mountain Mining District, the GPS coordinates are LATITUDE 41&#186; 30&#8217; 00&#8221; N and LONGITUDE 115&#186; 43&#8217; 00&#8221; W. The Property lies between 6,000 and 6,700 feet in elevation in a mountainous but not steeply rugged area. The land is administered by the United States Bureau of Land Management and the National Forest Service. Some adjoining areas are covered by other active mining claims. The land is used primarily for free range grazing and limited recreation but numerous major mines exist within 50 miles of the site and mining is an important part of the local culture. 

&#160; 

There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the Property. Exploration will be required before an evaluation as to the economic feasibility of the claim can be determined. It is our intention to record the deed of ownership in the name of Aureus Incorporated. Until we can validate otherwise, the Property is without known reserves and we have planned a four phase exploration program as recommended by our consulting geologist. We have not commenced any exploration or work on the claim and as discussed herein, are prohibited from doing so in connection with the federal and state conservation studies and activities in connection with the greater sage-grouse. 

&#160; 

Conditions to Retain Title the Mining Claim 

&#160; 

In order to retain title to the mining claims, we are required to renew the claims on an annual basis and pay fees. The title of the mining claims on the Property were previously registered in the name of Gold Exploration Management Services, Inc. (&#8220;Gold Exploration&#8221;). On August 31, 2015, Gold Exploration&#8217;s title to the mining claims on the Property expired but has been re-staked by the Company. Due to the Land Freeze by the ILLM in 2015 to protect the greater sage-grouse, Gold Exploration&#8217;s title to the mining claims on the Property were not able to be transferred into the Company&#8217;s name. The Company anticipates once the Land Freeze is lifted, Gold Exploration will apply to renew the claims and at that point the claims are expected to be transferred to the Company. There can be no assurances that the Land Freeze will be lifted or that if lifted, we will have sufficient funds to have the mining claims transferred into the Company&#8217;s name. 

&#160; 

Geology of the Mining Claims 

&#160; 

The geology of the Property is documented in mapping reported by Coash (1967) and Bushnell (1967) with refined stratigraphic work and age dates by Ketner, 2005. The Property is underlain by sheared, variably silicified and decalcified distal carbonate turbidities of the Tennessee Mountain Formation of Cambrian to Ordovician age (438 to 500 million years). These rocks are the footwall of major regional thrust faults which placed Pennsylvanian age Havallasequence (280 to 360 million years) and Upper Pennsylvanian Hammond Canyon and Sunflower Formations (280 to 248 million years). These rocks are intruded by the Cretaceous Coffeepot granitoid stock which is the center of extensive mineralizing activity including contact metasomatic and replacement deposits and probably the other major prospects in progressively lower temperature zones and varied host chemistry in a broad halo. 

&#160; 

It is significant also that the smaller Gold Creek Pluton 1.5 km west of the Property has been successful explored by Gateway Gold in its Coleman Creek property. The host rocks of interest at Gold Creek are the Sunflower and Hammond Canyon Formations, which are silty and locally cherty carbonate rocks affected by intense faulting, fracturing and alteration. The target at Coleman Creek is gold in veins, skarn, hornfels, fractured diorite and jasperoid. These are proximal to the diorite stock, and the operative model in this proposal is delineation of disseminated gold in the altered and receptive siliceous carbonate units more distal from the intrusive heat sources. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The subject claims are not covered by the younger volcanic rocks noted in the regional overview. Consequently, the area is suitable for low cost, low impact Phase I studies. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions 

&#160; 

The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies. 

&#160; 

Dependence on Major Customers 

&#160; 

We have no customers. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Agreements 

&#160; 

We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks. Additionally, we have no royalty agreements or labor contracts. 

&#160; 

Government Approvals and Regulations 

&#160; 

Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation 

&#160; 

In March 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (&#8220;USFWS&#8221;) submitted a finding of &#8220;warranted for listing but precluded by higher priorities&#8221; with regard to the greater sage-grouse, the largest grouse found in North America currently inhabiting the sage-steppe ecosystems in Montana, southern Idaho, northeastern California, eastern Oregon, northwestern Colorado, and broader sections of Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The USFWS finding that listing is &#8220;warranted but precluded&#8221; results in recognition of the greater sage-grouse as a candidate for listing as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (the &#8220;ESA&#8221;). The USFWS later entered into a court settlement with several environmental groups, which included a schedule for making listing determinations on over 200 candidate species, including the sage-grouse. In compliance with the consent decree, on September 22, 2015, the USFWS issued a decision that the species did not warrant listing as an endangered species under the ESA. The USFWS reached this determination after evaluating the species&#8217; population status, along with the collective efforts by The Bureau of Land Management (the &#8220;BLM&#8221;) and the U.S. Forest Service (the &#8220;USFS&#8221;), state agencies, private landowners and other partners to conserve its habitat. 

&#160; 

In connection with aforementioned-efforts, in 2014, Nevada adopted the Nevada Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Plan of 2014 (&#8220;2014 State Plan&#8221;), a sage-grouse conservation plan specific to Nevada. The 2014 State Plan provides broad goals, objectives, and management actions to ameliorate the primary threats to sage-grouse in Nevada and requires that any development that affects a greater sage-grouse habitat in Nevada will need to acquire credits to compensate for the effects before the development proceeds. In addition to the 2014 State Plan, Nevada is in the process of developing a Nevada Sage-Grouse Strategic Action Plan (&#8220;SAP&#8221;). The SAP will be a companion document to the 2014 State Plan and will go into greater detail and identify areas to focus conservation efforts in order to achieve the broad goals and objectives outlined in the 2014 State Plan. The SAP will identify where the primary threats to sage-grouse habitat are located across the landscape and provide specific guidance on how to ameliorate these threats based on local area conditions, resistance and resilience regimes, and ecological site descriptions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2015, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management (&#8220;ILLM&#8221;) approved an application to withdraw (i.e., close for mining) approximately 10 million acres of public and National Forest System lands identified as Sagebrush Focal Areas in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming from location and entry under the United States mining laws to protect the greater sage-grouse and its habitat from adverse effects of locatable mineral exploration and mining, subject to valid existing rights (the &#8220;Land Freeze&#8221;). Comments on the proposed withdrawal application or scoping comments on issues to be analyzed in the Environmental Impact Statement must have been received by December 23, 2015. The Company&#8217;s Property is included in the Land Freeze. Therefore, due the Land Freeze, of which the Company has no control and was not foreseeable (i.e., force majeure), the Company is currently prohibited from conducting any mining activities on the Property and, depending on the outcomes of the ILLM&#8217;s Environmental Impact Statement and Nevada&#8217;s SAP, the Company may be permanently prohibited or restricted from conducting any activities on the Property. The Company intends, however, to pursue potential acquisitions of other land on which it may conduct mining activities. The Company is not currently a party to any oral or written agreement to purchase any land at this point in time. 

&#160; 

Federal land management agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, may impose additional restrictions and mitigation obligations on development activities occurring on federal lands, which could also adversely impact our business. 

&#160; 

Mining Control and Reclamation Regulations 

&#160; 

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (&#8220;SMCRA&#8221;) is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (&#8220;OSM&#8221;) and establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining, as well as many aspects of underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSM. Although state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority. States in which we expect to have active future mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization. 

&#160; 

SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for prospecting including mine plan development, topsoil removal, storage and replacement, selective handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, protection of the hydrologic balance, subsidence control for underground mines, surface drainage control, mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment and re-vegetation. 

&#160; 

The U.S. mining permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize the pre-mining environmental condition of the permit area. We will develop mine and reclamation plans by utilizing this geologic data and incorporating elements of the environmental data. Our mine and reclamation plans incorporate the provisions of SMCRA, state programs and complementary environmental programs which impact mining. Also included in the permit application are documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required of the OSM&#8217;s Applicant Violator System, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors and principal stockholders of the applicant. 

&#160; 

Once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Some SMCRA mine permit applications take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine and often take six months to two years to be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on, and otherwise engage in, the permitting process including public hearings and intervention by the courts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Surface Disturbance 

&#160; 

All mining activities governed by the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) require reasonable reclamation. The lowest level of mining activity, &#8220;casual use,&#8221; is designed for the miner or weekend prospector who creates only negligible surface disturbance (for example, activities that do not involve the use of earth-moving equipment or explosives may be considered casual use). These activities would not require either a notice of intent to operate or a plan of operation. 

&#160; 

The second level of activity, where surface disturbance is 5 acres or less per year, requires a notice advising the BLM of the anticipated work 15 days prior to commencement. This notice must be filed with the appropriate field office . No approval is needed although bonding is required. State agencies must be notified to ensure all requirements are met. 

&#160; 

For operations involving more than 5 acres&#8217; total surface disturbance on lands subject to 43 CFR 3809, a detailed plan of operation must be filed with the appropriate BLM field office . Bonding is required to ensure proper reclamation. An Environmental Assessment (EA) is to be prepared for all plans of operation to determine if an Environmental Impact Statement is required. A National Environmental Policy Act review is not required for casual use or notice level operations unless those operations involve occupancy as defined by 43 CFR 3715. Most occupancies at the casual use and notice level in Arizona are covered by a programmatic EA. 

&#160; 

An activity permit is required when use of equipment is utilized for the purpose of land stripping, earthmoving, blasting (except blasting associated with an individual source permit issued for mining), trenching or road construction. 

&#160; 

Future legislation and regulations are expected to become increasingly restrictive and there may be more rigorous enforcement of existing and future laws and regulations and we may experience substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and may experience delays, interruptions or termination of operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines or penalties, the acceleration of cleanup and site restoration costs, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations and the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our future operations. 

&#160; 

Trespassing 

&#160; 

The BLM will prevent abuse of public lands while recognizing valid rights and uses under the mining laws. The BLM will take appropriate action to eliminate invalid uses, including unauthorized residential occupancy. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has found that a claim may be declared void by the BLM when it has been located and held for purposes other than the mining of minerals. The issuance of a notice of trespass may occur if an unpatented claim/site is: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; used for a home site, place of business, or for other purposes not reasonably related to mining or milling activities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; used for the mining and sale of leasable minerals or mineral materials, such as sand, gravel and certain types of building stone; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; located on lands that for any reason have been withdrawn from location after the effective date of the withdrawal. &#160; 

Trespass actions are taken by the BLM Field Office. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

We currently have no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning our exploration program. However, during Phase II, we anticipate that we be subject to various federal and state environmental laws and regulations that will impose significant requirements on our operations. The cost of complying with current and future environmental laws and regulations and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, particularly relating to air emissions, can reduce our profitability. Numerous federal and state governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. When we apply for these permits or approvals, we may be required to prepare and present to federal or state authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that a proposed exploration for, or production or processing of, may have on the environment. Compliance with these requirements can be costly and time-consuming and can delay exploration or production operations. A failure to obtain or comply with permits could result in significant fines and penalties and could adversely affect the issuance of other permits for which we may apply. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act 

&#160; 

The U.S. Clean Water Act and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. As a result of court decisions and regulatory actions, permitting requirements have increased and could continue to increase the cost and time we expend on compliance with water pollution regulations. These and other regulatory requirements, which have the potential to change due to legal challenges, Congressional actions and other developments increase the cost of, or could even prohibit, certain current or future mining operations. Our operations may not always be able to remain in full compliance with all Clean Water Act obligations and permit requirements. As a result, we may be subject to compliance orders and private party litigation seeking fines, penalties or changes to our operations. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act requirements that may affect our operations include the following: 

&#160; 

Section 404 

&#160; 

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires mining companies to obtain U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (&#8220;ACOE&#8221;) permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our construction and mining activities, including our surface mining operations, will frequently require Section 404 permits. ACOE issues two types of permits pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act: nationwide (or &#8220;general&#8221;) and &#8220;individual&#8221; permits. Nationwide permits are issued to streamline the permitting process for dredging and filling activities that have minimal adverse environmental impacts. An individual permit typically requires a more comprehensive application process, including public notice and comment, however an individual permit can be issued for ten years (and may be extended thereafter upon application).

The issuance of permits to construct valley fills and refuse impoundments under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, whether general permits commonly described as the Nationwide Permit 21 (NWP 21) or individual permits, has been the subject of many recent court cases and increased regulatory oversight. The results may materially increase our permitting and operating costs, permitting delays, suspension of current operations and/or prevention of opening new mines. 

&#160; 

Exploration Expenditures 

&#160; 

As of October 31, 2015 we have not made expenditures in regard to the actual exploration of the mining claims, other than spending $15,000 for our claims deposit, geological report and other staking and holding costs. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We do not have any employees other than our sole officer and director, Tracy Fortner. Mr. Fortner works for the Company&#8217;s business on a part-time basis. We intend to retain the services of independent geologists and engineers on a contract basis to conduct the exploration program on the Gold Creek Property. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

We have not spent any money on research and development activities during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

Dividend Policy 

&#160; 

We have never paid or declared dividends on our securities. The payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our earnings, our capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. We intend, for the foreseeable future, to retain future earnings for use in our business.
