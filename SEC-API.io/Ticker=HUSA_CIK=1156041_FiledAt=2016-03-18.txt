 Item 1. Business 

General 

Houston American Energy Corp is an independent oil and gas company focused on the development, exploration, exploitation, acquisition, and production of natural gas and crude oil properties in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and in South America. Our oil and gas assets and operations are concentrated primarily in the South American country of Colombia and in the onshore Gulf Coast region, particularly Texas and Louisiana.

We focus on early identification of, and entrance into, existing and emerging resource plays, particularly in South America, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Australia. We typically seek to partner with, or invest in, larger operators in the development of resources or retain interests, with or without contribution on our part, in prospects identified, packaged and promoted to larger operators. By entering these plays earlier and partnering with, investing in or promoting to, larger operators, we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs.

We, along with our partners, actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified, developed, monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves, production and shareholder value.

Properties 

Our exploration and development projects are focused on existing property interests, and future acquisition of additional property interests, in South America, particularly Colombia, and in the onshore Texas Gulf Coast region and Louisiana. 

Each of our property interests differ in scope and character and consists of one or more types of assets, such as 3-D seismic data, leasehold positions, lease options, working interests in leases, partnership or limited liability company interests, corporate equity interests or other mineral rights. Our percentage interest in each property represents the portion of the interest in the property we share with other partners in the property. Because each property consists of a bundle of assets that may or may not include a working interest in the project, our stated interest in a property simply represents our proportional ownership in the bundle of assets that constitute the property. Therefore, our interest in a property should not be confused with the working interest that we will own when a given well is drilled. Each of our exploration and development projects represents a negotiated transaction between the project partners relating to one or more properties. Our working interest may be higher or lower than our stated interest.

&#8212;

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we held interests in three concessions operated by Hupecol Operating Co. in Colombia. The Loc Picachos, Macaya and Serrania concessions are located in the Caguan Putumayo Basin of Colombia. The concessions cover an aggregate area of 392,205 acres. Our interest in each of the concessions is subject to an escalating royalty ranging from 8% to 20% depending upon production volumes and pricing and an additional 6% to 10% per concession when 5,000,000 barrels of oil have been produced on a field in a concession.

As of December 31, 2015, no wells had been drilled and no production had taken place on any of the fields in our then existing concessions in Colombia. Our estimated net cost associated with planned operations in Colombia during 2016 is approximately $425,000.

As operator of our various prospects, Hupecol has substantial control over the timing of drilling and selection of prospects to be drilled and we have limited ability to influence the selection of prospects to be drilled or the timing of such drilling operations and have no effective means of controlling the costs of such drilling operations. Accordingly, our drilling budget is subject to fluctuation based on the prospects selected to be drilled by Hupecol, the decisions of Hupecol regarding timing of such drilling operations and the ability of Hupecol to drill and operate wells within estimated budgets.

Serrania Block 

Our interest in the Serrania concession was acquired through a Farmout Agreement with the original operator of the block pursuant to which we will pay 25% of designated Phase 1 geological and seismic costs in return for a 12.5% interest in the Contract for Exploration and Production covering the concession. 

Seismic work on the Serrania Block was completed in 2010. Drilling preparation and seismic processing work was performed in 2011 and 2012 in connection with the planned drilling of initial test wells on the concession. The National Hydrocarbon Agency of Colombia (the &#147;ANH&#148;) has granted extensions of required development commitments, including drilling of a first test well on the Serrania concession, until conditions in the area allow operations.

During 2015, we, through Hupecol, were provided access to, and secured key approvals and local support for commencement of operations on, the Serrania block and commenced pre-drilling road work and environmental work on the Serrania block.

For 2016, Hupecol has advised us that they plan to complete pre-drill operations and to drill a first exploratory well on the Serrania concession with drilling operations targeted to commence by the end of the first quarter. Subject to prevailing conditions, drilling of a second well on the Serrania concession is planned during 2016. Hupecol had previously advised that those same planned operations would take place during prior years. Hupecol&#146;s plans for 2016 may change based on commodity prices, field conditions and other factors beyond our control or the control of Hupecol. 

Los Picachos and Macaya Prospects 

Our Los Picachos and Macaya prospects adjoin our Serrania concession. Hupecol has advised us that they plan to begin seismic preparation on the Los Picachos and Macaya concessions during 2016, subject to conditions in the area allowing operations. The ANH has granted extensions of required development commitments, including seismic acquisition, until conditions in the area allow operations. 

Planned Australian Investment 

In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire, for $1,000,000, a 12.5% equity ownership interest in Tamboran Resources Limited, an Australian oil and gas company (&#147;Tamboran&#148;), with certain anti-dilution rights for a period of nine months. Closing of the planned acquisition of the interest in Tamboran is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by Tamboran, including the receipt by Tamboran of funding from investors other than Houston American Energy in an amount not less than A$705,000.

Tamboran holds interests ranging from 25% to 100% in blocks covering multi-million acres in Australia. Tamboran&#146;s primary efforts are focused in the Beetaloo/McArthur Basin in the Northern Territory of Australia where an initial well has been drilled and logged and is awaiting completion and commencement of production.

Drilling Activity 

During 2015, we participated in the drilling of a total of two gross wells, both in the United States. Both of those wells were classified as exploratory wells and were dry holes. The following table summarizes the number of wells drilled during 2015, 2014, and 2013, excluding any wells drilled under farmout agreements, royalty interest ownership, or any other wells in which we do not have a working interest.

Productive wells are wells that are found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had no wells in progress or awaiting hook up. 

Productive Wells 

Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells. A well bore with multiple completions is counted as only one well. As of December 31, 2015, we owned interests in nine gross wells. As of December 31, 2015, we had ownership interests in productive wells, categorized by geographic area, as follows:

Natural Gas and Oil Reserves 

Reserve Estimates 

The following tables sets forth, by country and as of December 31, 2015, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, and the estimated present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10%) of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes (PV-10) and after future income taxes (Standardized Measure) of our proved reserves, each prepared in accordance with assumptions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

The PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carry forwards and other factors. We believe investors and creditors use our PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.

These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.

(1) In accordance with applicable financial accounting and reporting standards of the SEC, the estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions at December 31, 2015. For purposes of determining prices, we used the unweighted arithmetical average of the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2015. The average prices utilized for purposes of estimating our proved reserves were $50.13 per barrel of oil and $2.63 per mcf of natural gas for our US properties, adjusted by property for energy content, quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. 

(2) Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. 

(3) The Standard Measure differs from PV-10 only in that the Standard Measure reflects estimated future income taxes. 

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, proved reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates. 

Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies 

The reserve estimates, including PV-10 and Standard Measure estimates, set forth above were prepared by Lonquist &#38; Co., LLC. 

These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards. 

Our year-end reserve report is prepared by Lonquist &#38; Co. based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, geosciences and engineering data, and other information provided to them by our management team. Lonquist &#38; Co. also prepares reserve estimates for the various Hupecol entities. Upon analysis and evaluation of data provided, Lonquist &#38; Co. issues a preliminary appraisal report of our reserves. The preliminary appraisal report and changes in our reserves are reviewed by our President for reasonableness of the results obtained. Once any questions have been addressed, Lonquist &#38; Co. issues the final appraisal report, reflecting their conclusions.

Lonquist &#38; Co. is an independent professional engineering firm specializing in the technical and financial evaluation of oil and gas assets. Lonquist &#38; Co&#146;s report was conducted under the direction of Don E. Charbula, P.E., Vice President of Lonquist &#38; Co. Mr. Charbula holds a BS in Petroleum Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin and is a registered professional engineer with more than 30 years of experience in production engineering, reservoir engineering, acquisitions and divestments, field operations and management. Lonquist &#38; Co., and its employees, have no interest in our Company and were objective in determining our reserves. 

The SEC&#146;s rules with respect to technologies that a company can use to establish reserves allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.

Lonquist &#38; Co. used a combination of production and pressure performance, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no proved undeveloped reserves. 

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage 

The following table sets forth the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions), categorized by geographical area, which we held as of December 31, 2015:

Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres with defined remaining terms and not within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well. 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we can generally retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases or by paying delay rentals during the remaining primary term of leases. The oil and natural gas leases in which we have an interest are for varying primary terms and, if production under a lease continues from our developed lease acreage beyond the primary term, we are entitled to hold the lease for as long as oil or natural gas is produced. 

Many of the leases and concessions comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the acreage has been established prior to such 

date, in which event the lease or concession will remain in effect until the cessation of production. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the expiration periods of the gross and net acres that are subject to leases or concessions summarized in the above table of undeveloped acreage.

Title to Properties 

Title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried working, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the gas and oil industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than preliminary review of local records). 

Investigation, including a title opinion of local counsel, generally is made before commencement of drilling operations. 

Marketing 

At December 31, 2015, we had no contractual agreements to sell our gas and oil production and all production was sold on spot markets. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had three full-time employees and no part time employees. The employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we do not anticipate that any of our future employees will be covered by such agreements. 

Competition 

We encounter intense competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. Our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies, numerous independent oil and gas companies and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the oil and gas business for a much longer time than our Company. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties, exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. 

Regulatory Matters 

Regulation of Oil and Gas Production, Sales and Transportation 

The oil and gas industry is subject to regulation by numerous national, state and local governmental agencies and departments. Compliance with these regulations is often difficult and costly and noncompliance could result in substantial penalties and risks. Most jurisdictions in which we operate also have statutes, rules, regulations or guidelines governing the conservation of natural resources, including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, minimum well spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells and the establishment of maximum rates of 

production from oil and gas wells. Some jurisdictions also require the filing of drilling and operating permits, bonds and reports. The failure to comply with these statutes, rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties and the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. 

Environmental Regulation 

Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the discharge of materials into the environment, may affect our exploration, development and production operations and the costs of those operations. These laws and regulations, among other things, govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials and waste management, the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities, financial assurance and the remediation of contaminated sites. These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance and for any contamination resulting from our operations and may require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. 

The environmental laws and regulations applicable to our U.S. operations include, among others, the following United States federal laws and regulations: 

&#8226; Clean Air Act, and its amendments, which govern air emissions; 

&#8226; Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into waters of the United States; 

&#8226; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which imposes liability where hazardous releases have occurred or are threatened to occur (commonly known as &#147;Superfund&#148;); 

&#8226; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the management of solid waste; 

&#8226; Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which imposes liabilities resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States; 

&#8226; Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires reporting of toxic chemical inventories; 

&#8226; Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the underground injection and disposal of wastewater; and 

&#8226; U.S. Department of Interior regulations, which impose liability for pollution cleanup and damages. 

Colombia has similar laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. 

We routinely obtain permits for our facilities and operations in accordance with these applicable laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. There are no known issues that have a significant adverse effect on the permitting process or permit compliance status of any of our facilities or operations. 

The ultimate financial impact of these environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determined as new standards are enacted and new interpretations of existing standards are rendered. Environmental laws and regulations are expected to have an increasing impact on our operations. In addition, any non-compliance with such laws could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties, or other liabilities. Potential permitting costs are variable and directly associated with the type of facility and its geographic location. Costs, for example, may be incurred for air emission permits, spill contingency requirements, and discharge or injection permits. These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance with government regulations. 

Although we do not operate the properties in which we hold interests, noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations by the operators of our oil and gas properties could expose us, and our properties, to potential costs and liabilities associated with such environmental laws. While we exercise no oversight with respect to any of our operators, we believe that each of our operators is committed to environmental protection and compliance. However, since environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and in the operations of companies engaged in similar businesses and since regulatory requirements frequently change and may become more stringent, there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Such costs may result in increased costs of operations and acquisitions and decreased production. 

Climate Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulation 

Federal, state and local laws and regulations are increasingly being enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of &#147;greenhouse gases&#148; may have on the environment and climate worldwide. These effects are widely referred to as &#147;climate change.&#148; Since its December 2009 endangerment finding regarding the emission of greenhouse gases, the EPA has begun regulating sources of greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. Among several regulations requiring reporting or permitting for greenhouse gas sources, the EPA finalized its &#147;tailoring rule&#148; in May 2010 that determines which stationary sources of greenhouse gases are required to obtain permits to construct, modify or operate on account of, and to implement the best available control technology for, their greenhouse gases. In November 2010, the EPA also finalized its greenhouse gas reporting requirements, beginning in March 2012, for certain oil and gas production facilities. 

Moreover, in recent past the U.S. Congress has considered establishing a cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases. Under past proposals, the EPA would issue or sell a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. The net effect of such legislation, if ever adopted, would be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as crude oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. In addition, while the prospect for such cap-and-trade legislation by the U.S. Congress remains uncertain, several states have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, similar cap-and-trade programs. 

As a crude oil and natural gas company, the debate on climate change is relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases. Additionally, the combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the crude oil and natural gas we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, any current or future federal, state or local climate change initiatives could adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on the combustion of fossil fuels, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although our compliance with any greenhouse gas regulations may result in increased compliance and operating costs, we do not expect the compliance costs for currently applicable regulations to be material. Moreover, while it is not possible at this time to estimate the compliance costs or operational impacts for any new legislative or regulatory developments in this area, we do not anticipate being impacted to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.
