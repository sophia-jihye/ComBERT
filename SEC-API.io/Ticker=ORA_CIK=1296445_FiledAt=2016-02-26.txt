Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leading vertically integrated company primarily engaged in the geothermal and recovered energy power business. With the objective of becoming a leading global provider of renewable energy, we are focused on several key initiatives, which directly align with our new strategic plan, as described below. 

&#160; 

We design, develop, build, own, and operate clean, environmentally friendly geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants, usually using equipment that we design and manufacture. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our geothermal power plants include both power plants that we have built and power plants that we have acquired, while we have built all of our recovered energy-based plants. We currently conduct our business activities in the following two business segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Electricity segment &#8212; in this segment we develop, build, own and operate geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants in the U.S. and geothermal power plants in other countries around the world and sell the electricity they generate; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Product segment &#8212; in this segment we design, manufacture and sell equipment for geothermal and recovered energy-based electricity generation, remote power units and other power generating units and provide services relating to the engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants. 

&#160; 

The map below shows our worldwide portfolio of operating geothermal and recovered energy power plants as of February 23, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

The charts below show the relative contributions of the Electricity segment and the Product segment to our consolidated revenues and the geographical breakdown of our segment revenues for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Additional information concerning our segment operations, including year-to-year comparisons of revenues, the geographical breakdown of revenues, cost of revenues, results of operations, and trends and uncertainties is provided below in Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Item 8 &#8212; &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;.

&#160;

Most of the power plants that we currently own or operate produce electricity from geothermal energy sources. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable and generally sustainable form of energy derived from the natural heat of the earth. Unlike electricity produced by burning fossil fuels, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources is produced without emissions of certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, and with far lower emissions of other pollutants such as carbon dioxide. As a result, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources contributes significantly less to global warming and local and regional incidences of acid rain than energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In addition, compared to some other renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar, geothermal is a firm and flexible form of energy and is generally available all the time. Geothermal energy is also an attractive alternative to other sources of energy as part of a national diversification strategy to avoid dependence on any one energy source or politically sensitive supply sources. 

&#160; 

In addition to our geothermal energy business, we manufacture products that produce electricity from recovered energy or so-called &#8220;waste heat&#8221;. We also construct, own, and operate recovered energy-based power plants. Recovered energy comes from residual heat that is generated as a by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing. Such residual heat, which would otherwise be wasted, may be captured in the recovery process and used by recovered energy power plants to generate electricity without burning additional fuel and without additional emissions. 

&#160;

During 2015, we refined and started to implement a number of the elements of a new multi-year strategic plan. We expect the plan to evolve over time in response to market conditions and other factors. At this time however, we expect that our primary focus will be as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Expand our geothermal geographical reach . While we continue to evaluate opportunities worldwide, we currently see Mexico, Chile, Indonesia and Ethiopia as very attractive geothermal markets for us. We are actively looking at ways to expand our presence in those countries. In addition, we are looking to expand and accelerate growth through acquisition activities globally. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Expand into new technologies. We ultimately hope to be able to leverage our technological capabilities over a variety of renewable energy platforms, including solar power generation and energy storage. Initially, however, we expect that our focus will be on expanding our core geothermal competencies, such as expanding into more high temperature geothermal generation equipment and facilities. For example, we recently announced a new collaboration with Toshiba described below, which we anticipate may facilitate joint development of geothermal systems consisting of Ormat&#8217;s binary system and Toshiba&#8217;s flash system, among other things. We may acquire companies with technological and integration capabilities we do not currently have, or develop new technology ourselves, where we can effectively leverage our expertise to implement this part of our strategic plan. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Expand our customer base. We are evaluating a number of strategies for expanding our customer base to C&#38;I customers. In the near term, however, we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be generated as they currently are, with our traditional electrical utility customer base for the Electricity segment and our on-going business development efforts for new customers for our Product segment. 

&#160; 

While we believe that long-term growth can be realized through our transformational efforts over time, there is no assurance if and when we will meet our objective to become a leading global provider of renewable energy or that such efforts will result in long-term growth. To be clear, we see these new initiatives as incremental measures to enhance shareholder value. While we implement the plan, we expect to continue, and expand, through organic growth, acquisitions, and other measures, our current business lines both in the Electricity and Product segments as well as other business lines as described above.

We indirectly own and operate all of our power plants, although financial institutions hold equity interests in three of our consolidated subsidiaries: (i) OPC, which owns the Desert Peak 2 power plant in our Brady complex and the Steamboat Hills, Galena 2 and Galena 3 power plants in our Steamboat complex; (ii) ORTP, which owns the Heber complex, the Ormesa complex, the Mammoth complex, the Steamboat 2 and 3 and Burdette (Galena 1) power plants both in our Steamboat complex, and Brady power plant in our Brady complex; and (iii) ORPD, which owns the Puna power plant, the Don A. Campbell complex and the OREG 1, OREG 2 and OREG 3 power plants. In the above table, we show these power plants as being 100% owned because all of the generating capacity is owned by either OPC, ORTP or ORPD and we control the operation of the power plants. The nature of the equity interests held by the financial institutions is described below in Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;OPC Transaction&#8221;, &#8220;ORTP Transaction&#8221;, and &#8220;ORPD Transaction&#8221;. 

&#160; 

(2) 

References to generating capacity generally refer to the gross generating capacity less auxiliary power in the case of all of our existing power plants, except the Zunil power plant. We determine the generating capacity figures in these power plants by taking into account resource capabilities. In the case of the Zunil power plant, revenues are calculated based on a 24 MW capacity unrelated to the actual performance of the reservoir. This column represents our net ownership in such generating capacity. 

&#160;

&#160; In any given year, the actual power generation of a particular power plant may differ from that power plant&#8217;s generating capacity due to variations in ambient temperature, the availability of the resource, and operational issues affecting performance during that year. &#160; &#160; 

(3) 

The generating capacity of the Ormesa complex was reduced in 2015 mainly due to a permanent shutdown of one of the steam turbines and some of the old OECs in order to optimize plant performance. 

&#160; 

(4) 

The McGinness phase 2 power plant reached commercial operation on February 1, 2015. The Don A. Campbell phase 2 power plant reached commercial operation on September 17, 2015. The generating capacities of both complexes are higher than originally expected. 

&#160; 

(5) 

On April 30, 2015, we announced the closing of an equity transaction with Northleaf Geothermal Holdings, LLC. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Northleaf acquired a 36.75% equity interest in ORPD which owns the Puna complex and the Don A. Campbell, OREG 1, OREG 2 and OREG 3 power plants. See Item 7 - &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;ORPD transaction&#8221;. 

&#160; 

(6) 

Plant 4 in the Olkaria III complex reached commercial operation on January 18, 2016 increasing the complex&#8217;s capacity by 29 MW to 139 MW. 

&#160; 

(7) 

The OREG 4 power plant is not operating at full capacity as a result of continued low run time of the compressor station that serves as the plant&#8217;s heat source. This results in lower power generation. 

&#160; &#160; 

All of the revenues that we derive from the sale of electricity are pursuant to long-term PPAs. Approximately 40.5% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015 were derived from the sale of electricity by our domestic power plants to power purchasers that currently have investment grade credit ratings. The purchasers of electricity from our foreign power plants are either state-owned or private entities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

New Power Plants &#160; 

&#160; 

We are currently in various stages of construction and development of new power plants and expansion of existing power plants. Our expansion plan includes 49 MW in generating capacity from geothermal power plants in Honduras and Indonesia that are fully released for construction and are in different stages of construction. In addition, we have several projects worldwide that are either under initial stages of construction or under different stages of development with an aggregate capacity of up to approximately 140 MW. 

&#160; 

We have a substantial land position across 30 prospects in the U.S., Guatemala, New Zealand, Kenya, Chile and Ethiopia that are expected to support future geothermal development, on which we have started or plan to start exploration activity. This land position is comprised of various leases, exploration concessions for geothermal resources and an option to enter into geothermal leases. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our Product Business (Product Segment) 

&#160; 

We design, manufacture and sell products for electricity generation and provide the related services described below. We primarily manufacture products to fill customer orders, but in some situations we may manufacture products as inventory for future internal and external projects. 

&#160; 

Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants . We design, manufacture and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. In geothermal power plants using OECs, geothermal fluid (either hot water (also called brine) or steam or both) is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead to a vaporizer that also heats a secondary working fluid, which is vaporized and used to drive the turbine. The secondary fluid is then condensed in a condenser which may be cooled directly by air or by water from a cooling tower and sent back to the vaporizer. The cooled geothermal fluid is then reinjected back into the reservoir. Our customers include contractors and geothermal power plant developers, owners and operators. 

&#160; 

Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation . We design, manufacture and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy, or so-called &#8220;waste heat&#8221;. This heat is generated as a residual by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing, and is not otherwise used for any purpose. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, and other companies engaged in other energy-intensive industrial processes. 

&#160; 

EPC of Power Plants. We engineer, procure, and construct, as an EPC contractor, geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered energy-based power units described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe we have an advantage in that we are using our own manufactured equipment and thus have better quality and better control over the timing and delivery of required equipment and its related costs. As part of our new strategy and collaboration agreement with Toshiba we might have EPC contracts that are based on Toshiba power units. We also expect to develop additional knowledge in integrating Toshiba power units combined with our OECs in order to maximize the benefits to our customers. 

&#160; 

Remote Power Units and Other Generators . We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. Our customers include contractors who install gas pipelines in remote areas and off-shore platforms operators and contractors. In addition, we design, manufacture, and sell generators, including heavy duty direct-current generators, for various other uses. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

We were formed as a Delaware corporation in 1994 by Ormat Industries. Ormat Industries was one of the first companies to focus on the development of equipment for the production of clean, renewable and generally sustainable forms of energy. On February 12, 2015, we successfully completed the acquisition of Ormat Industries, eliminating its majority ownership and control of us. Our acquisition of Ormat Industries is described in greater detail below under &#8220;Recent Developments.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

Geothermal Energy 

&#160; 

Most of our power plants in operation produce electricity from geothermal energy. There are several different sources or methods of obtaining geothermal energy, which are described below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Hydrothermal geothermal-electricity generation &#8212; Hydrothermal geothermal energy is derived from naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs that are formed when water comes sufficiently close to hot rock to heat the water to temperatures of 300 degrees Fahrenheit or more. The heated water then ascends toward the surface of the earth where, if geological conditions are suitable for its commercial extraction, it can be extracted by drilling geothermal wells. Geothermal production wells are normally located within several miles of the power plant, as it is not economically viable to transport geothermal fluids over longer distances due to heat and pressure loss. The geothermal reservoir is a renewable source of energy if: (i) natural ground water sources and reinjection of extracted geothermal fluids are adequate over the long-term to replenish the geothermal reservoir following the withdrawal of geothermal fluids and (ii) the well field is properly operated. Geothermal energy power plants typically have higher capital costs (primarily as a result of the costs attributable to well field development) but tend to have significantly lower variable operating costs (principally consisting of maintenance expenditures) than fossil fuel-fired power plants that require ongoing fuel expenses. In addition, because geothermal energy power plants produce weather-independent power 24 hours a day, the variable operating costs are lower. 

&#160; 

EGS &#8212; An EGS is a subsurface system that may be artificially created to extract heat from hot rock where the permeability and aquifers required for a hydrothermal system are insufficient or non-existent. A geothermal power plant that uses EGS techniques recovers the thermal energy from the subsurface rocks by creating or accessing a system of open fractures in the rock through which water can be injected, heated through contact with the hot rock, returned to the surface in production wells and transferred to a power unit. 

&#160; 

Co-produced geothermal from oil and gas fields, geo-pressurized resources &#8212; Another source of geothermal energy is hot water produced as a by-product of oil and gas extraction. When oil and gas wells are deep, the fluids are often at high temperatures and if the water volume is significant, the hot water can be used for power generation in equipment similar to a geothermal power plant. 

&#160; 

Geothermal Power Plant Technologies 

&#160; 

Geothermal power plants generally employ either binary systems or conventional flash design systems, as briefly described below. In our geothermal power plants, we also employ our proprietary technology of combined geothermal cycle systems. 

&#160; 

Binary System 

&#160; 

In a geothermal power plant using a binary system, geothermal fluid (either hot water (also called brine) or steam or both) is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead through a gathering system of insulated steel pipelines to a vaporizer that also heats a secondary working fluid. This is typically an organic fluid, such as pentane or butane, which is vaporized and is used to drive the turbine. The organic fluid is then condensed in a condenser which may be cooled directly by air or by water from a cooling tower and sent back to the vaporizer. The cooled geothermal fluid is then reinjected back into the reservoir. Ormat&#8217;s air-cooled binary geothermal power plant is depicted in the diagram below. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Flash Design System 

&#160; 

In a geothermal power plant using flash design, geothermal fluid is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead through a gathering system of insulated steel pipelines to flash tanks and/or separators. There, the steam is separated from the brine and is sent to a demister, where any remaining water droplets are removed. This produces a stream of dry saturated steam, which drives a steam turbine generator to produce electricity. In some cases, the brine at the outlet of the separator is flashed a second time (dual flash), providing additional steam at lower pressure used in the low pressure section of the steam turbine to produce additional electricity. Steam exhausted from the steam turbine is condensed in a surface or direct contact condenser cooled by cold water from a cooling tower. The non-condensable gases (such as carbon dioxide) are removed by means of a vacuum system in order to maintain the performance of the steam condenser. The resulting condensate is used to provide make-up water for the cooling tower. The hot brine remaining after separation of steam is injected (either directly or after passing through a binary plant to produce additional power from the residual heat remaining in the brine) back into the geothermal resource through a series of injection wells. The flash technology is depicted in the diagram below. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In some instances, the wells directly produce dry steam and the steam is fed directly to the steam turbine with the rest of the system similar to the flash power plant described above. 

&#160; 

Our Proprietary Technology 

&#160; 

Our proprietary technology may be used in power plants operating according to the Organic Rankine Cycle, either alone or in combination with various other commonly used thermodynamic technologies that convert heat to mechanical power, such as gas and steam turbines. It can be used with a variety of thermal energy sources, such as geothermal, recovered energy, biomass, solar energy and fossil fuels. Specifically, our technology involves original designs of turbines, pumps, and heat exchangers, as well as formulation of organic motive fluids (all of which are non-ozone-depleting substances). Using advanced computerized fluid dynamics and other computer aided design software as well as our test facilities, we continuously seek to improve power plant components, reduce operations and maintenance costs, and increase the range of our equipment and applications. We are always examining ways to increase the output of our plants by utilizing evaporative cooling, cold reinjection, performance simulation programs, and topping turbines. In the geothermal as well as the recovered energy (waste heat) areas, we are examining two-level and three-level energy systems and new motive fluids. 

&#160; 

We also developed, patented and constructed GCCU power plants in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. Ormat Geothermal Combined Cycle technology is depicted in the diagram below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the conversion of geothermal energy into electricity, our technology has a number of advantages over conventional geothermal steam turbine plants. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant consumes significant quantities of water, causing depletion of the aquifer and requiring cooling water treatment with chemicals and thus a need for the disposal of such chemicals. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant also creates a significant visual impact in the form of an emitted plume from the cooling towers, especially during cold weather. By contrast, our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants have a low profile with minimum visual impact and do not emit a plume when they use air cooled condensers. Our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants reinject all of the geothermal fluids utilized in the respective processes into the geothermal reservoir. Consequently, such processes generally have no emissions. 

&#160; 

Other advantages of our technology include simplicity of operation, easy maintenance and higher yearly availability. For instance, the OEC employs a low speed and high efficiency organic vapor turbine directly coupled to the generator, eliminating the need for reduction gear. In addition, with our binary design, there is no contact between the turbine blade and geothermal fluids, which can often be very corrosive and erosive. Instead, the geothermal fluids pass through a heat exchanger, which is less susceptible to erosion and can adapt much better to corrosive fluids. In addition, with the organic vapor condensed above atmospheric pressure, no vacuum system is required. 

&#160; 

We use the same elements of our technology in our recovered energy products. The heat source may be exhaust gases from a Brayton cycle gas turbine, low pressure steam, or medium temperature liquid found in the process industries such as oil refining and cement manufacturing. In most cases, we attach an additional heat exchanger in which we circulate thermal oil or water to transfer the heat into the OEC&#8217;s own vaporizer in order to provide greater operational flexibility and control. Once this stage of each recovery is completed, the rest of the operation is identical to that of the OECs used in our geothermal power plants and enjoys the same advantages of using the Organic Rankine Cycle. In addition, our technology allows for better load following than conventional steam turbines, requires no water treatment (since it is air cooled and organic fluid motivated), and does not require the continuous presence of a licensed steam boiler operator on site. 

&#160;

Ormat&#8217;s REG technology is depicted in the diagram below. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Patents 

&#160; 

We have 72 U.S. patents that are in force (and have approximately 30 U.S. patents pending). These patents and patent applications cover our products (mainly power units based on the Organic Rankine Cycle) and systems (mainly geothermal power plants and industrial waste heat recovery plants for electricity production). The products-related patents cover components that include turbines, heat exchangers, seals and controls as well as control of operation of geothermal production well pumps. The system-related patents cover not only particular components but also the overall energy conversion system from the &#8220;fuel supply&#8221; (e.g., geothermal fluid, waste heat, biomass or solar) to electricity production. 

&#160; 

The system-related patents cover subjects such as waste heat recovery related to gas pipeline compressors and industrial waste heat, disposal of non-condensable gases present in geothermal fluids, power plants for very high pressure geothermal resources, two-phase fluids as well as processes related to EGS. A number of our patents cover combined cycle geothermal power plants, in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. The remaining terms of our patents range from one year to 18 years. The loss of any single patent would not have a material effect on our business or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We are conducting research and development activities intended to improve plant performance, reduce costs, and increase the breadth of our product offerings. The primary focus of our research and development efforts is targeting power plant conceptual thermodynamic cycle and major equipment including continued performance, cost and land usage improvements to our condensing equipment, and development of new higher efficiency and higher power output turbines. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Additionally, we are continuing to evaluate investment opportunities in new companies with technology and/or product offerings for renewable energy and energy storage solutions. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

Interest in geothermal energy in the U.S. remains strong for numerous reasons, including legislative support of RPS, coal and nuclear base load energy retirement and increasing awareness of the positive value of geothermal characteristics as compared to intermittent renewable technology. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Today, electricity generation from geothermal resources is concentrated mainly in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho and Utah, and we believe there are opportunities for development in other states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Washington and Oregon due to the potential of their geothermal resources. 

&#160; 

In a report issued in February 2015, the GEA indicated that the U.S. geothermal industry had about 3,500 MW of installed nameplate capacity and about 1,250 MW of geothermal projects under various phases of consideration or development in 10 U.S. states. 

&#160; 

The U.S. geothermal market experienced modest growth mainly, according to the GEA, due to the uncertainty surrounding the federal PTC for new projects combined with unbalanced mechanisms for valuing baseload power and integration costs in California (where a significant amount of U.S. geothermal resources are located). 

&#160; 

The successful implementation of the various confirmed and unconfirmed geothermal projects identified by the GEA depends on the respective project sponsor&#8217;s ability to fully identify the resource, conduct exploration, and carry out development and construction. Accordingly, the GEA estimates may not be realized, and differences between the actual number of projects completed and those initially estimated to be completed may be material. We refer to the GEA assessment as a possible reference point, but we do not necessarily concur with its estimate. 

&#160; 

State level legislation 

&#160; 

One of the factors supporting growth in the renewable energy industry is global concern about climate change. In response to increasing demand for &#8220;green&#8221; energy, many countries have adopted legislation requiring, and providing incentives for, electric utilities to sell electricity generated from renewable energy sources. In the U.S., 38 states and four territories have enacted an RPS, renewable portfolio goals, or similar laws requiring or encouraging utilities in such states to generate or buy a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable energy or recovered heat sources. 

&#160; 

According to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), 30 states and two territories (including California, Nevada, and Hawaii, where we have been the most active in our geothermal energy development and in which all of our operating U.S. geothermal power plants are located) and the District of Columbia define geothermal resources as &#8220;renewable&#8221;. In addition, according to the EPA, 25 states have enacted RPS, Clean Energy Standards, Energy Efficiency Resource Standards or Alternative Portfolio Standards program guidelines that include some form of combined heat and power and/or waste heat recovery. 

&#160; 

We see the impact of RPS legislation as the most significant driver for us to expand existing power plants and to build new projects. 

&#160; 

California 

&#160; 

The California RPS was established in 2002 under Senate Bill (SB) 1078 accelerated in 2006 under SB 107 and further expanded in 2011 under SB(x)1-2. The RPS program requires investor-owned utilities (IOUs), electric service providers, community choice aggregators and publicly-owned utilities to increase their share of procurement from eligible renewable energy resources as a percentage of their total procurement. The RPS goal of 33 percent by 2020 was revised in October 2015, when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 350 requiring that 50 percent of total retail electricity sales be from renewable resources by 2030, with interim targets of 40 percent by 2024, and 45 percent by 2027. 

&#160; 

According to the CPUC Biennial RPS Program Update published in January 2016, California&#8217;s three largest IOUs collectively generated 26.6% of their 2014 retail electricity sales from renewable resources. These utilities have interim targets each year, with a requirement to attain RPS of 25% by 2016. Publicly-owned utilities in California are also required to procure 50% of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources by 2030, opening up an additional market of potential off-takers for us. This expanded target could benefit geothermal energy, which has the advantage of generating flexible base load power, and helping California diversify its mix of renewable resources. 

&#160; 

In 2006, California passed a state climate change law, Assembly Bill (AB) 32, to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the end of 2020, and in December 2010, the CARB approved cap-and-trade regulations to reduce California&#8217;s GHG emissions below the levels set by AB 32. The regulations set a limit on emissions from sources responsible for emitting 80% of California&#8217;s GHGs. On November 2015, the CARB released the results of its fifth joint auction for California and Qu&#233;bec allowances reporting that the vintage 2015 auction clearing price was $12.73 per allowance and the future vintage auction clearing price was $12.65 per allowance. All of the available 2015 and future vintage allowances offered were sold. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In 2014, AB 2363 became effective, requiring the CPUC to adopt by December 31, 2015 a methodology for determining the costs of integrating eligible renewable energy resources. As of the date of this report no methodology has been adopted. 

&#160; 

Nevada 

&#160; 

Nevada&#8217;s RPS was first adopted by the Nevada Legislature in 1997. Nevada&#8217;s RPS targets were revised and expanded and currently require NV Energy to supply at least 25% of the total electricity it sells from eligible renewable energy resources by 2025. For each of 2013 and 2014, Nevada&#8217;s RPS required that at least 18% of electricity sold to Nevada retail customers be from renewable energy resources and credits, and at least 5% of that amount be from solar resources. According to NV Energy&#8217;s Annual RPS Compliance Report, in 2014, Nevada Power exceeded both the 2014 RPS requirement and the 2014 solar RPS requirement, achieving 20.2% and 32.8%, respectively. Sierra exceeded both the 2014 RPS requirement and the 2014 solar RPS requirement, with 33.6% and 20.6% respectively. 

&#160; 

In June 2013, the Nevada state legislature passed three bills that were signed into law and expected to support renewable energy development. SB No. 123 requires an electric utility to submit a plan for the retirement or elimination of not less than 800 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity on or before December 31, 2019 and the construction or acquisition of, or contracting for, 350 MW of electric generating capacity from renewable energy facilities. SB No. 252 revises provisions relating to the renewable portfolio standard by removing energy efficiency, solar multipliers, and station usage from generating portfolio energy credits (PECs). Finally, AB No. 239 Revised Statutes 701A.340 defines geothermal energy as renewable energy for purposes of tax abatements and makes geothermal projects eligible to apply for partial sales and property tax abatements, with property tax abatements for 20 years and local sales and use tax abatements for three years. 

&#160; 

Hawaii 

&#160; 

Hawaii established a renewable portfolio goal in 2001. Since 2001, the RPS targets were revised and expanded. On June 2015, Hawaii became the only state with a legislative goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045 with the signing of HB 623. The new policy includes interim requirements of 15% by the end of 2015, 30% by the end of 2020, 40% by 2030, and 70% by 2040, ultimately reaching 100% renewable electricity by 2045. 

&#160; 

According to a 2015 filing made with the PUCH, in 2014, Hawaiian Electric Company and its subsidiaries exceeded the 2014 RPS requirement, achieving a consolidated RPS of 38.6% of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources, including electrical energy savings from energy efficiency and solar water heating technologies. Excluding electrical energy savings from energy efficient and solar water heating technologies, the 2014 renewable generation percentage for the Hawaiian Electric Companies was 21.3%. 

&#160; 

Other States 

&#160; 

Other state-wide and regional initiatives are also being developed to reduce GHG emissions and to develop trading systems for renewable energy credits. For example, nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States are part of the RGGI, a regional cap-and-trade system to limit carbon dioxide. The RGGI is the first, market-based carbon dioxide emissions reduction program in the U.S. The RGGI states implemented a new 2014 RGGI cap of 91 million short tons and plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants at a rate of 2.5% per year between 2015 and 2020. States sell nearly all emission allowances through auctions and invest proceeds in energy efficiency, renewable energy and other consumer benefit programs. These programs are spurring innovation in the clean energy economy and creating green jobs in the RGGI states. 

&#160; 

In addition to RGGI, other states have also established the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (Midwest Accord) and the Western Climate Initiative (WCI). The RGGI, the WCI and the Midwest Accord have formed the North America 2050, a Partnership for Progress (NA2050) that facilitates state and provincial efforts to design, promote and implement cost-effective policies that reduce GHG emissions and create economic opportunities. 

&#160; 

Although individual and regional programs will take some time to develop, their requirements, particularly the creation of any market-based trading mechanism to achieve compliance with emissions caps, should be advantageous to in-state and in-region (and, in some cases, such as RGGI and the State of California, inter-regional) energy generating sources that have low carbon emissions such as geothermal energy. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In December 2015, the White House announced that 154 companies from across the American economy signed the American Business Act on Climate Pledge to demonstrate their support for action on climate change. By signing the American Business Act on Climate pledge, these companies are demonstrating an ongoing commitment to climate action. As part of this initiative, each company is announcing significant pledges to reduce their emissions, increase low-carbon investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more sustainable businesses and tackle climate change. 

&#160; 

Although it is currently difficult to quantify the direct economic benefit of these efforts to reduce GHG emissions, we believe they will prove advantageous to us. 

&#160; 

Federal level legislation 

&#160; 

On August 3, 2015, President Obama and the EPA announced the Clean Power Plan that sets standards for power plants and customized goals for states to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate change. The goal of the proposed plan includes cutting carbon emissions from the power sector by 32% below 2005 levels nationwide by 2030. We believe that if the Clean Power Plan inserted, it will create demand for renewables in states that have untapped geothermal potential like Utah and New Mexico. States are given flexibility to meet these goals, but are required to submit implementation plans to the EPA by September 6, 2016 or request extensions to submit implementation plans by September 6, 2018. The EPA is also developing a federal plan and will implement a plan for those states that fail to submit an implementation plan or fail to get an approved plan. In February 2016, the Supreme Court of the U.S. granted a temporary stay halting implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the proposed plan. 

&#160; 

The federal government also encourages production of electricity from geothermal resources or solar energy through certain tax subsidies. For a new geothermal power plant in the U.S. that started construction by December 31, 2016, we are permitted to claim an investment tax credit against our U.S. federal income taxes equal to 30% of certain eligible costs when the project is placed in service. If we failed to meet the start of construction deadline for such a project, then the 30% credit is reduced to 10%. In lieu of the 30% investment tax credit (if the project qualifies), we are permitted to claim production tax credits which are based on the power produced from a geothermal power plant. These production-based credits, which in 2015 were 2.3 cents per kWh, may be adjusted annually for inflation and may be claimed for ten years on the electricity produced by the project and sold to third parties after the project is placed in service. The owner of the power plant may not claim both the 30% investment tax credit and the production-based tax credit. New solar projects that are under construction by December 2019 will qualify for a 30% investment tax credit. The credit will fall to 26% for projects starting construction in 2020 and 22% for projects starting construction in 2021. Projects that are under construction before these deadlines must be placed in service by December 2023 to qualify. The investment credit will revert to its permanent 10% level after that. Under current tax rules, any unused tax credit has a one-year carry back and a twenty-year carry forward. 

&#160; 

We are also permitted to depreciate, or write off, most of the cost of the plant. In those cases where we claimed the one-time 30% (or 10%) tax credit or received the Treasury cash grant, our tax basis in the plant that we can recover through depreciation is reduced by one-half of the tax credit or cash grant; if in the future we claim other tax credits, there is no reduction in the tax basis for depreciation. For projects that we placed into service after September 8, 2010 and before January 1, 2012, a depreciation &#8220;bonus&#8221; will permit us to write off 100% of the cost of certain equipment that is part of the geothermal power plant in the year the plant is placed into service, if certain requirements are met. For projects that are placed into service after December 31, 2011 and before January 1, 2017, a similar &#8220;bonus&#8221; will permit us to write off 50% of the cost of that equipment in the year the power plant is placed into service. New equipment put in service in 2018 would qualify for a 40% bonus. Equipment put in service in 2019 would qualify for a 30% bonus. After applying any depreciation bonus that is available, we can write off the remainder of our tax basis in the plant, if any, over five years on an accelerated basis, meaning that more of the cost may be deducted in the first few years than during the remainder of the depreciation period. 

&#160; 

Collectively, these benefits (to the extent they are fully utilized) have a present value equivalent to approximately 30% to 40% of the capital cost of a new power plant. 

&#160; 

Global 

&#160; 

We believe the global markets continue to present growth and expansion opportunities in both established and emerging markets. 

&#160; 

According to the GEA&#8217;s Annual U.S. and Global Geothermal Power Production Report, the global geothermal market was developing about 11.5-12.3 GW of planned capacity spread across 80 countries. Additionally, the GEA estimates that, based on current data, the global geothermal industry is expected to reach between 14.5 GW and 17.6 GW by 2020. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The assessment conducted by the GEA is only an estimate that is based on projects and resource reporting by the geothermal industry. A developer&#8217;s ability to fully develop a geothermal resource is dependent upon its capabilities to identify the resource and conduct exploration, development and construction; therefore, this estimate may not be accurate. We refer to it only as a possible reference point, but we do not necessarily concur with this estimate. 

&#160; 

Operations outside of the U.S. may be subject to and/or benefit from increasing efforts by governments and businesses around the world to flight climate change and move towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. 

&#160; 

In December 2015, 195 countries signed an historic agreement at the COP21 UN Climate Change Conference held in Paris. For the first time, all countries committed to setting nationally determined climate targets and reporting on their progress. The agreement&#8217;s aim is to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),the submission of national targets in five-year cycles signals to investors and technology innovators that the world will demand clean power plants, energy efficient factories and buildings, and low-carbon transportation in the decades to come. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, a group of 20 countries, including the US, UK, France, China and India, pledged to double their budget for renewable energy technology over the next five years as part of a separate initiative called Mission Innovation. 

&#160; 

Also in November 2015, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition was launched by a group of 28 private investors with the objective of bringing companies with the potential to deliver affordable, reliable and carbon free power from the research lab to the market. 

&#160; 

We believe that these developments and governmental plans will create opportunities for us to acquire and develop geothermal power generation facilities internationally, as well as create additional opportunities for our Product segment. 

&#160; 

Outside of the U.S., the majority of power generating capacity has historically been owned and controlled by governments. Since the early 1990s, however, many foreign governments have privatized their power generation industries through sales to third parties encouraging new capacity development and/or refurbishment of existing assets by independent power developers. These foreign governments have taken a variety of approaches to encourage the development of competitive power markets, including awarding long-term contracts for energy and capacity to independent power generators and creating competitive wholesale markets for selling and trading energy, capacity, and related products. Some foreign regions and countries have also adopted active government programs designed to encourage clean renewable energy power generation such as the following countries in which we operate and/or are conducting business development activities: 

&#160; 

Europe 

&#160; 

Turkey has the richest known geothermal resources in Europe with the theoretical potential for 31,000 MW of geothermal capacity and with a proven geothermal capacity of 4.5 GW, according to the Turkish Mineral Technical Exploration Agency (MTA). 

&#160; 

Since 2004, we have established strong relationships in the Turkish market and provided our full range of solutions including our supply of state-of-the-art binary systems to 17 geothermal power plants with a total capacity of nearly 300 MW and 5 power plants under construction. 

&#160; 

In Turkey, the &#39;National Renewable Energy Action Plan&#39; proposes to increase the country&#39;s renewable energy generation capacity to 61 GW by 2023, including 1.5 GW of geothermal. The plan is supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The plan aims to increase Turkish energy security by diversifying its energy supply, make greater use of domestic resources, protect the environment by relying on clean, renewable and low carbon technologies and foster energy market efficiency through private sectors investment and integration. 

&#160; 

The plan also seeks to attract private investments in research and development and in geothermal exploitation for electricity production and to provide financial support to innovation and technology research in the field of renewable energies. Special emphasis and attention has been placed on using locally manufactured equipment in renewable energy based generating facilities, with a target set for 45% of equipment used in such facilities by the end of 2019 to be manufactured locally. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

To achieve its objective of having 30% of its power generated from renewable sources by 2023, Turkey has changed the renewable energy law first enacted in 2007. The law sets the feed-in tariffs (FITs) for geothermal energy at $105 per MWh. The FITs apply for a ten-year period from the date of commissioning. Renewable energy producers will also benefit from an 85% discount on transmission costs for 10 years and various priority rights over land usage. In order to benefit from the incentives under the renewable energy law, a renewable energy generation facility must hold a renewable energy resource certificate (the RER Certificate), which is issued by Turkey&#8217;s Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). The RER Certificate will be valid for the term of the generation license of the relevant generation company. In addition, and to avoid rights and licenses manipulation, a pre-feasibility license must be issued and paid for upon the request to hold a concession. These pre-licenses must be turned into full licenses for developed fields within three years of issuance, or they become void and the license rights may be re-assigned. The current law allows FITs to be applied to projects that will be put into operation until October 2020. In addition, in the event that a developer uses locally sourced equipment in its plant, a premium will be added into the tariffs. 

&#160; 

Latin America 

&#160; 

Several Latin American countries have renewable energy programs. In November 2013, the national government of Guatemala , where our Zunil and Amatitlan power plants are located, approved a law creating incentives for power generation from renewable energy sources. These incentives include, among other things, providing economic and fiscal incentives such as exemptions from taxes on the importation of relevant equipment and various tax exemptions for companies implementing renewable energy projects. Additionally, the Energy Policy 2013-2027 identifies great untapped potential for renewable energy production in Guatemala, including 1,000 MW for geothermal. One of the main objectives of the Energy Policy is to secure a supply of electricity at competitive prices by diversifying the energy mix with an 80% renewable energy share target for 2027. 

&#160; 

In Honduras , where we are planning to build the first geothermal power plant under a BOT agreement, the national government approved the Incentives Act (Decree No.70-2007) providing incentives in the form of tax exemptions for equipment, materials and services related to power generation development based on renewable resources. At the same time, ENEE, the national integrated utility, will buy energy from such projects and offer to pay rates that are above the marginal cost approved by the CNE. Honduras also set a target to reach at least 80% renewable energy production by 2034. 

&#160; 

In Chile , where we have one exploration concession, the Chilean Renewable Energy Act of 2008 required 5% of electricity sold, to come from renewable sources, increasing gradually to 10% by 2024. On October 14, 2013, the President of Chile signed into law a bill which mandates that utilities source 20% of their electricity from &#8220;non-conventional&#8221; renewable energy (ERNC), including solar PV and concentrating solar power (CSP), by 2025. 

&#160; 

Mexico is the world&#8217;s fourth largest producer of geothermal energy. Recent studies suggest an over 9,000 MW geothermal potential, of which only 12% is already developed. In December 2013, the Mexican Congress passed a constitutional reform (Energy Reform) in an attempt to increase the participation of private investors in the generation and commercialization of electric energy. This reform affects the electricity market by opening the generation and commercialization of electricity to private companies, transforming the Federal Electricity Commission to a for-profit public company, and redefining the functions and attributions of the Ministry of Energy. The secondary legislation that establishes the attributions of the public entities, procurement regulations, and normative framework for the productive State companies was finalized in 2014. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, Mexico launched round zero and assigned the projects to be developed by Mexico&#39;s state-owned utility Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), with the remainder to be put out to tender to the private sector. Thirteen geothermal areas and five concessions were given by the Mexican Secretariat of Energy (Sener) to the CFE. The government expects to award private companies with concessions for 30 years and permits for up to 150 km 2 for three years in the case of exploration. Ormat is in various discussions with local companies to identify attractive geothermal resources and projects. 

&#160; 

Many island nations in general and specifically the Caribbean nations, depend almost entirely on petroleum to meet their electricity demands. With an average electricity price of US$35 per MWh in 2014, the lack of diversified power generation leaves Caribbean nations vulnerable to commodity market volatility, while the lack of new development leaves them reliant on what are believed to be outdated and often unreliable power plants. The larger issue hindering large-scale renewable energy deployments, however, is scale. Caribbean nations have quite significant renewable energy potential yet most have small demand. The majority of the Caribbean grids are relatively old, with the average diesel generators more than 20 years old. Furthermore, the power supply is relatively inefficient with high system losses. Due to their sizes, each of the Caribbean countries is generally dominated by one local utility and simple market structures where electricity is regulated directly by local governments. Other than in Guadeloupe, where a geothermal power plant that we recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to acquire has been operating since 1985, there are no other operating geothermal projects in the Caribbean region. Recently, some deep well drilling exploration was performed on a few islands, but the results of this exploration are still pending. Although few, we believe there are opportunities for us in the Caribbean. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Oceania 

&#160; 

In New Zealand , where we have been actively providing geothermal power plant solutions since 1988, the New Zealand government&#8217;s policies to fight climate change include an unconditional GHG emissions reduction target of between 10% and 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and a target to increase renewable electricity generation to 90% of New Zealand&#8217;s total electricity generation by 2025. 

&#160; 

South East Asia 

&#160; 

In Indonesia , where we participate in the Sarulla project that is currently under construction, the government intends to increase the role of renewable energy sources and aims to have them meet 23% of domestic energy demand by 2025. The government has also implemented new policies and regulations intended to accelerate the development of renewable energy and geothermal projects in particular. In June 2014, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) issued a new geothermal tariff policy. The MEMR reverted to a location-based tariff regime while adding a time dimension. The tariffs range from $0.118 to $0.296 per kWh between 2015 and 2025, depending on location. The tariffs provide a ceiling price for the power purchase agreements between project developers and PLN, the national utility and off taker. The tariffs were set to include the effect of inflation on projects that are expected to commence commercial operation in the distant future. 

&#160; 

In addition, the 2014 National Energy Policy (NEP) calls for the increased use of geothermal energy to represent at least 5% of the national energy mix by 2025. 

&#160; 

In order to further accelerate geothermal development in the country a new FIT regime is expected to become effective during early 2016. The FIT is planned to range from $0.162 to $0.297 per kWh depending on size and location. Additionally, in January 2016, the government of Indonesia announced it will offer 21 geothermal blocks to investors over the next two years. Ormat plans to participate in select appropriate bids. 

&#160; 

In the IPP sector, certain regulations for geothermal projects have been implemented, providing incentives such as investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and pricing guidelines to allow for preferential power prices for generators. 

&#160; 

On January 2016, the President of Indonesia issued new presidential regulations (PR No. 4 2016) to accelerate the Indonesian 35 GW Power Generation Program. The regulations introduce a new government guarantee for development of power projects, which would cover both projects developed by the state-owned utility company, PLN, and those projects developed by PLN in cooperation with IPPs or their subsidiaries. Additionally, a shorter period to obtain necessary permits for development was introduced as well as clarifications that geothermal projects can be developed in high-conservation forest areas (e.g. national parks). 

&#160; 

The Government of Indonesia is planning to revise negative investment regulation (DNI). According to Presidential Decree No. 39/2014, the development of geothermal power plants with a capacity of less than 10 MW is closed to foreign ownership. Currently, foreign investors may own up to 95 percent of plants with generating capacities greater than 10 MW. The revised regulations, currently under government review, will allow foreign entities to wholly own geothermal power plants with generating capacities greater than 10 MW and to own 67% of smaller sized geothermal power plants 

&#160; 

On a macro level, the Government of Indonesia committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 26% by 2020 at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen and during 2015 in Paris. 

&#160; 

East Africa 

&#160; 

In East Africa the geothermal potential along the Rift Valley is estimated at several thousand MW. The different countries along the Rift Valley are at different stages of development of their respective geothermal potentials. 

&#160; 

In Kenya , there are already several geothermal power plants, including the only geothermal IPP in Africa, our Olkaria III complex. The Government of Kenya has identified the country&#39;s untapped geothermal potential as the most suitable indigenous source of electricity and it aspires to reach 5,000 MW of geothermal power by 2030. To attain such number, GDC was formed to fast track the development of geothermal resources in Kenya. Ormat has as a 51% interest in a consortium that signed a PPA for a 35 MW geothermal power plant in the Menengai area. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Government of Kenya is aiming to reach 22.7GW of power generating capacity by 2033, under the Least-Cost Power Development Plan 2013-33 with a target of 42% of such capacity generated from renewable energy sources (including large hydro but excluding solar). 

&#160; 

In December 2012, FITs for various technologies were reviewed and the process of negotiating PPAs streamlined. Projects under this mechanism have priority grid access at the cost of the developer. Geothermal projects from 35 MW to 70 MW have a USD $0.088 per kWh (up to 500MW) FIT. 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Departmental Committee of Finance, Planning, and Trade (DCFPT) amended the Income Tax Act in view of the 2015 Finance Bill. The amendments include maintaining the enhanced investment deduction of 150% under section 17B and extending the period of deduction of tax losses to over 10 years. 

&#160; 

The governments of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eretria, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zambia are exploring ways to develop geothermal in their countries, mostly through the help of international development organizations such as the World Bank. 

&#160; 

In January 2014, energy ministers and delegates from 19 countries committed to the creation of the Africa Clean Energy Corridor Initiative (Corridor), at a meeting in Abu Dhabi convened by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Corridor will boost the deployment of renewable energy and aim to help meet Africa&#8217;s rising energy demand with clean, indigenous, cost-effective power from sources including hydro, geothermal, biomass, wind and solar. 

&#160; 

East Africa and South East Asia may benefit from two initiatives announced by President Obama. In June 2013, the Power Africa initiative was announced, which contemplated that the U.S. would invest up to $7.0 billion in sub-Saharan Africa over the ensuing five years with the aim of doubling access to power. The program will partner the U.S. government with the governments of six sub-Saharan countries, among them Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania, that have the potential for geothermal energy development. In 2012, President Obama proposed the U.S. Asia Pacific Comprehensive Energy Partnership (USACEP) that encourages U.S. companies to develop renewable energy in South East Asian countries, including Indonesia. The U.S. will provide up to $6.0 billion to support the Partnership. 

&#160; 

Other opportunities &#160; 

&#160; 

Recovered Energy Generation 

&#160; 

In addition to our geothermal power generation activities, we are pursuing recovered energy-based power generation opportunities in North America and the rest of the world. We believe recovered energy-based power generation will ultimately benefit from the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in the U.S., FERC has expressed its position that one of the goals of new natural gas pipeline design should be to facilitate the efficient, low-cost transportation of fuel through the use of waste heat (recovered energy) from combustion turbines or reciprocating engines that drive station compressors to generate electricity for use at compressor stations or for commercial sale. FERC has, as a matter of policy, requested natural gas pipeline operators filing for a certificate of approval for new pipeline construction or expansion projects to examine &#8220;opportunities to enhance efficiencies for any energy consumption processes in the development and operation&#8221; of the new pipeline. We have built over 21 power plants which generate electricity from &#8220;waste heat&#8221; from gas turbine-driven compressor stations along interstate natural gas pipelines, from midstream gas processing facilities, and from processing industries in general. 

&#160; 

Several states, and to a certain extent, the federal government, have recognized the environmental benefits of recovered energy-based power generation. For example, 15 states currently allow electric utilities to include recovered energy-based power generation in calculating such utilities&#39; compliance with their mandatory or voluntary RPS and/or Energy Efficient Resources Standards. In addition, California modified the Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), which allows recovered energy-based generation to qualify for a per watt incentive. 

&#160; 

In 2012, the Governor of Utah signed into law SB12 that enables the sale of electricity directly to large energy users. This direct purchase and sale, could create a market opportunity for our REG technology in Utah. The local utility has developed a tariff to provide rates and methodologies for companies that want to buy power directly from renewable generation facilities. 

&#160; 

Also in 2012, Senate Bill 315 was enacted by the State of Ohio. Senate Bill 315 made waste energy recovery eligible as a renewable resource for purposes of meeting the state&#8217;s Renewable Portfolio Standard, as well as an efficiency measure under the state&#8217;s Energy Efficiency Resource Standard. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In addition, in Colorado the state PUC ruled that Xcel Energy, the largest utility in Colorado, will begin offering a $500 per kW incentive for recycled energy projects. The incentive will be paid out over 10 years to developers and manufacturers who convert waste heat from stacks and process it into electricity. 

&#160;

At the Federal level, Under the Clean Power Plan, waste-heat-to-power (recovered energy) is an eligible technology that can be implemented by states as means to comply with their Clean Power Plan emissions reduction targets. The inclusion of waste-heat-to-power as an eligible technology under the Clean Power Plan will potentially create demand for REG in states that have good waste-heat resources, but that so far had no policies in place, like an RPS, to create demand for renewables. 

&#160; 

Recovery of waste heat is also considered &#8220;environmentally friendly&#8221; in the western Canadian provinces. On November 22, 2015, the Government of Alberta released the Clean Leadership Plan that includes (a) phasing out of coal-fired electricity generation by 2030; (b) a commitment to generate 30 percent of Alberta&#8217;s electricity from renewable sources by 2030; (c) new financing for energy efficiency; and (d) an economy-wide price on carbon pollution. This comprehensive set of climate policies, once fully implemented, will encourage the development of renewable energy technologies, including waste heat recovering, in Alberta. We believe that Europe and other markets worldwide may offer similar opportunities in recovered energy-based power generation. 

&#160; 

In summary, the market for the recovery of waste heat converted into electricity exists either when the already available electricity is expensive or where the regulatory environment facilitates construction and marketing of power generated from recovered waste heat. However, such projects tend to be relatively small (up to 6MW) and we expect the growth to be relatively slow and geographically scattered. 

&#160; 

New activities under our strategic plan &#160; 

&#160; 

The traditional grid is undergoing a major disruption. The continued decline in Solar PV prices is impacting renewable energy pricing and the growth in intermittent green energy is generating increasing strains on the grid, mainly in the U.S and Europe. As a result, electricity storage is becoming a key component of the future grid. In parallel, we see movement of C&#38;I and communities toward direct purchases of electricity. 

&#160; 

Energy Storage 

&#160; 

Energy storage systems utilize low cost, surplus, available electricity that enables utilities to optimize the operation of the grid and generators to run closer to full capacity for longer periods of time and operate more efficiently and effectively. With the increasing use of wind and solar energy, the need for storage services such as balancing services, frequency regulation, rapid generation ramping and movement of energy from times of excess to times of high demand is becoming more important. 

&#160; 

The global energy storage market is still developing, with specific applications and geographies leading the overall market. Based on Navigant research, approximately 80 GW of energy storage is forecasted to be installed through 2024, representing accumulated installed revenues for this period of up to $68 billion (compound annual growth rate of 36.9%). We refer to the Navigant research as a possible reference point, but we do not necessarily concur with its estimate. 

&#160; 

We see the storage market evolving in a manner like the broader renewable energy market, with developers diversifying their offerings to include storage projects at C&#38;I and grid scale sites. Storage technology involves multiple components from storage devices, software and electrical components for communication systems and grid interconnection equipment. Some of the capabilities required are similar to the development of renewable energy power plants and include the ability to sell projects or services to similar entities with which we have already created sustainable relationships. 

&#160; 

Ormat plans to enter the energy storage market in one or more ways, such as project developer, integrator, EPC and equity investor and owner. We expect that our global presence, experience in technology integration, and flexible business models, and our reputation and experience in the geothermal and recovered energy sectors will help us expand into this growing sector. 

&#160; 

C&#38;I 

&#160; 

The C&#38;I sector is shifting from centralized electricity generation systems to distributed resources supported by emerging models of direct PPAs with renewable power plants, on-site deployments, and customized solutions to energy management. Participants in the C&#38;I sector are motivated to purchase renewable energy to reduce costs and diversify their energy supply, to lock in long-term energy price stability and carbon footprint reductions, to achieve renewable energy targets and to demonstrate leadership, innovation, and competitive first mover advantages. Ormat sees C&#38;I customers as a natural expansion of our customer base from regulated utilities to medium and large C&#38;I clients desiring to contract for renewable energy. 

&#160; 

The advances in electricity storage technology together with high period demand charges, demand response programs, concern over electricity supply reliability and more aggressive goals for renewable energy content than those of centralized electricity suppliers are all factors that have supported the growth of the C&#38;I market. The need for technical customized solutions to meet these varied C&#38;I needs fits well with our experience in providing customized geothermal and REG solutions to various customers around the world. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Ormat&#8217;s capabilities as an integrator, solution provider and product packager should help us to compete in the market place. 

&#160; 

Solar PV &#160; 

&#160; 

The market for Solar PV power grew significantly in recent years, driven by a combination of favorable government policies and a decline in equipment prices. We are monitoring market drivers with the potential to develop Solar PV power plants in locations where we can offer competitively priced power generation. Our focus currently is on large-scale solar power plant development opportunities worldwide such as in: (i) Chile, where the total installed Solar PV capacity increased from 6 MW in 2013 to almost 1 GW by the end of 2015 and is currently considered the cheapest source of electricity in the country, (ii) Mexico, considered among the largest potential national markets in Latin America on the strength of high solar resources and recent energy market reform, (iii) India, where the central government recently gave its approval to ramp up India&#8217;s solar power capacity target to achieve 100 GW by 2022 (60 GW of grid connected solar power projects and 40 GW of rooftop solar) and (iv) the East Africa region, where a considerable amount of solar radiation and abundant available land constitute significant solar potential. Governments in the East Africa region have introduced various solar targets and incentives which provide opportunities for installing grid-tied and off-grid Solar PV systems to displace fuel costs. 

&#160;

Competitive Strengths &#160; 

&#160; 

Competitive Assets. We believe our assets are competitive for the following reasons: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Contracted Generation. All of the electricity generated by our geothermal power plants is currently sold pursuant to long-term PPAs with an average remaining life of approximately 15 years. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Baseload Generation . All of our geothermal power plants supply all or a part of the baseload capacity of the electric system in their respective markets. This means they supply electric power on an around-the-clock basis. This provides us with a competitive advantage over other renewable energy sources, such as wind power, solar power or hydro-electric power (to the extent they depend on precipitation), which cannot provide baseload capacity because of their intermittent nature. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Ancillary Services. Geothermal power plants positively impact electrical grid stability and provide valuable ancillary services. Because of the baseload nature of their output, they have high transmission utilization efficiency, provide capacity, provide grid inertia and reduce the need for ancillary services such as voltage regulation, reserves and flexible capacity. Other intermittent renewables create integration costs, adding a significant value for geothermal energy. 

&#160; 

Competitive Pricing. Geothermal power plants, while site specific, are economically feasible in many locations, and the electricity they generate is generally price competitive under existing economic conditions and existing tax and regulatory regimes compared to electricity generated from fossil fuels or other renewable sources in many places around the world. Geothermal energy is recognized as one of the lower cost sources of energy from a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective. 

&#160; 

Ability to Finance Our Activities from Internally Generated Cash Flow. The cash flow generated by our portfolio of operating geothermal and REG power plants provides us with a robust and predictable base for certain exploration, development, and construction activities. We plan to evaluate various alternatives for financing the expansion of our business as we further develop and implement our new strategic plan. 

&#160; 

Growing Legislative Demand for Environmentally-Friendly Renewable Resource Assets. Most of our currently operating power plants produce electricity from geothermal energy sources. The clean and sustainable characteristics of geothermal energy give us a competitive advantage over fossil fuel-based electricity generation as countries increasingly seek to balance environmental concerns with demands for reliable sources of electricity. 

&#160; 

High Efficiency from Vertical Integration . Unlike our competitors in the geothermal industry, we are a fully-integrated geothermal equipment, services, and power provider. We design, develop, and manufacture equipment that we use in our geothermal and REG power plants. Our intimate knowledge of the equipment that we use in our operations allows us to operate and maintain our power plants efficiently and to respond to operational issues in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Moreover, given the efficient communications among our subsidiary that designs and manufactures the products we use in our operations and our subsidiaries that own and operate our power plants, we are able to quickly and cost effectively identify and repair mechanical issues and to have technical assistance and replacement parts available to us as and when needed. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Exploration and Drilling Capabilities. We have in-house capabilities to explore and develop geothermal resources and have established a drilling operation that currently owns nine drilling rigs. We employ an experienced resource group that includes engineers, geologists, and drillers, which executes our exploration and drilling plans for projects that we develop. 

&#160; 

Highly Experienced Management Team. We have a highly qualified senior management team with extensive experience in the geothermal power sector. 

&#160; 

Technological Innovation . We have 72 U.S. patents in force (and have approximately 30 U.S. patents pending) relating to various processes and renewable resource technologies. All of our patents are internally developed. Our ability to draw upon internal resources from various disciplines related to the geothermal power sector, such as geological expertise relating to reservoir management, and equipment engineering relating to power units, allows us to be innovative in creating new technologies and technological solutions. 

&#160; 

Limited Exposure to Fuel Price Risk . A geothermal power plant does not need to purchase fuel (such as coal, natural gas, or fuel oil) in order to generate electricity. Thus, once the geothermal reservoir has been identified and estimated to be sufficient for use in a geothermal power plant, the drilling of wells is complete and the plant has a PPA, the plant is not exposed to fuel price or fuel delivery risk apart from the impact fuel prices may have on the price at which we sell power under PPAs that are based on the relevant power purchaser&#8217;s avoided costs. 

&#160; 

Although we are confident in our competitive position in light of the strengths described above, we face various challenges in the course of our business operations, including as a result of the risks described in Item 1A &#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below, the trends and uncertainties discussed in &#8220;Trends and Uncertainties&#8221; under Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; below, and the competition we face in our different business segments described under &#8220;Competition&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy&#160; 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to continue building a geographically balanced portfolio of geothermal and recovered energy assets, and to continue to be a leader in the geothermal energy market with the objective of becoming a leading global provider of renewable energy. During 2015, we have refined and started to implement a number of the elements of a new multi-year strategic plan. We expect the plan to evolve over time in response to market conditions and other factors. We intend to implement this strategy through: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Development and Construction of New Geothermal Power Plants &#8212; continuously seeking out commercially exploitable geothermal resources, developing and constructing new geothermal power plants and entering into long-term PPAs providing stable cash flows in jurisdictions where the regulatory, tax and business environments encourage or provide incentives for such development; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Expanding our geographical reach &#8211; increasing our business development activities in an effort to grow our business in the global markets in both business segments. While we continue to evaluate global opportunities, we currently see Mexico, Chile, Indonesia and Ethiopia as very attractive markets for us. We are actively looking at ways to expand our presence in those countries. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Acquisition of New Assets &#8212; expanding and accelerating growth through acquisition activities globally, aiming to acquire from third parties additional geothermal and Solar PV assets as well as companies that will expedite our entrance into the storage and C&#38;I markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Manufacturing and Providing Products and EPC Services Related to Renewable Energy &#8212; designing, manufacturing and contracting power plants for our own use and selling to third parties power units and other generation equipment for geothermal and recovered energy-based electricity generation; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Expand ing into N ew T echnologies &#8211; &#160; leveraging our technological capabilities over a variety of renewable energy platforms, including solar power generation and energy storage. Initially, however, we expect that our focus will be on expanding our core geothermal competencies, such as expanding into more high temperature geothermal generation equipment and facilities. For example, we recently announced a new collaboration with Toshiba described below, which we anticipate may facilitate joint development of geothermal systems consisting of Ormat&#8217;s binary system and Toshiba&#8217;s flash system, among other things. We may acquire companies with integration and technological capabilities we do not currently have, or develop new technology ourselves, where we can effectively leverage our expertise to implement this part of our strategic plan. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Expand our customer base - evaluating a number of strategies for expanding our customer base to the C&#38;I market. In the near term, however, we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be generated as they now are, with our traditional electrical utility customer base for the Electricity segment. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Increasing Output from Our Existing Power Plants &#8212; increasing output from our existing geothermal power plants by adding additional generating capacity, upgrading plant technology, and improving geothermal reservoir operations, including improving methods of heat source supply and delivery; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Cost saving by i ncreasing efficiencies &#8211; increasing efficiencies in our operating power plants and manufacturing facility including procurement by adding new technologies, restructuring of management control, automating part of our manufacturing work and centralizing our operating power plants. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Technological Expertise &#8212; investing in research and development of renewable energy technologies and leveraging our technological expertise to continuously improve power plant components, reduce operations and maintenance costs, develop competitive and environmentally friendly products for electricity generation and target new service opportunities. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

The most significant recent developments in our company and business are described below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On February 3, 2016, we announced that we commenced commercial operation of Plant 4 in the Olkaria III complex in Kenya, increasing the complex total generating capacity by 29 MW to 139 MW. Plant 4 will sell its electricity to KPLC under a 20-year PPA. In October 2015, Ormat signed an amendment to the PPA with KPLC that enables the increase of the capacity of Plant 4 expansions to an aggregate of 100 MW, in phases. Plant 4 was financed by Ormat equity which is covered by an insurance policy from MIGA (a member of the World Bank Group) to cover Ormat&#8217;s exposure to certain political risks involved in operating in developing countries. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On January 12, 2016, we announced that we commenced construction of the 35 MW Platanares geothermal project in Honduras. In 2013, Ormat signed a BOT contract for the Geot&#233;rmica Platanares geothermal project in Honduras with ELCOSA, a privately owned Honduran energy company, for approximately 15 years from the COD. The Platanares project will sell its power, mainly under 30-year PPA with the national utility of Honduras, ENEE. We expect the project to reach commercial operation by the end of 2017 and generate average annual revenues of approximately $33 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On December 7, 2015, we announced that we signed a binding MOU to acquire, gradually, 85% of Geothermie Bouillante SA (GB) at a total company enterprise value of up to approximately &#8364;52 million (approximately USD$56 million, based on current foreign currency exchange rates). GB owns and operates a 14.75 MW geothermal power plant and owns two exploration licenses with a total additional potential capacity of up to 30 MW, all located on Guadeloupe Island, a French territory in the Caribbean. Upon closing, Ormat will hold approximately 80% of GB which will be increased to 85% within two years by capital investment agreed upon in the MOU. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ormat&#8217;s total consideration will be paid in installments in accordance with specific milestones, including production milestones, expected to be achieved in the next few years. Closing is expected by May 2016 and the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Ormat&#8217;s earnings per share. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GB has two PPAs with &#201;lectricit&#233; de France S.A. (EDF) the French electric utility. A new 15-year PPA with EDF with improved energy rates recently became effective and replaced the previous PPAs. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On November 17, 2015, we announced that Mr. Yoram Bronicki resigned from his position as the Chairman of our Board of Directors, effective November 16, 2015. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board appointed Mr. Stanley Stern as a director to fill the vacancy on the Board, and appointed existing director Mr. Gillon Beck as the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Beck also served as our Chairman from May 2012 until June 2014. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679;

On November 15, 2015, Ms. Dita Bronicki resigned from her position as a director on our Board of Directors and as a member of the Compensation Committee. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board appointed Ms. Ravit Barniv as a director to fill the vacancy on the Board and as a member of the Compensation Committee. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On October 14, 2015, we announced that we signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Toshiba Corporation to develop strategic opportunities for collaboration in the areas of geothermal power generation systems and related equipment. Under the terms of the agreement, Ormat and Toshiba will explore and develop strategic opportunities that will enable them to offer potential customers a more competitive solution for comprehensive supplies and services related to geothermal development, from resource assessment, field development and power plant EPC to power plant operation. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On September 17, 2015, the Don A. Campbell phase 2 geothermal power plant located in Mineral County, Nevada began commercial operation 10 months after the project broke ground and less than two years after we commenced firm operation of the first phase in December 2013. The phase 2 power plant is generating approximately 20 MW (net) and we sell this electricity under a 20-year PPA with SCPPA. SCPPA resells the entire output of this plant to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On September 11, 2015, Kenya&#39;s Income Tax Act was amended pursuant to certain provisions of the recently adopted Finance Act, 2015. Among other matters, these amendments retain the enhanced investment deduction of 150% under Section 17B of the Income Tax Act, extend the period for deduction of tax losses from five years to ten years under Sections 15(4) and 15(5) of the Income Tax Act, and amend the effective date from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015 under Sections 15(4) and 15(5) of the Income Tax Act. Previously, we had a valuation allowance for the additional 50% investment deduction reducing our deferred tax asset in Kenya as the utilization of the related tax losses was not probable within the original five year carryforward period. As a result of the change in legislation and the expected continued profitability during the extended carryforward period, we expect that we will be able to fully utilize the carryforward tax losses within the ten year period and as such we released the valuation allowance in Kenya resulting in a $49.4 million tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On July 31, 2015, one of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ortitl&#224;n, Limitada, obtained a 12-year secured term loan in the principal amount of $42.0 million for the 20 MW Amatitl&#224;n power plant in Guatemala. Under the credit agreement with Banco Industrial S.A. and Westrust Bank (International) Limited, we have the flexibility to expand the Amatitl&#224;n power plant with financing to be provided either via equity, additional debt from Banco Industrial S.A. or from other lenders, subject to certain limitations on expansion financing in the credit agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On June 8, 2015, we repurchased $30.6 million aggregate principal amount of our OFC Senior Secured Notes from certain OFC noteholders. As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a loss of $1.7 million, including amortization of deferred financing cost of $0.5 million, which is included in other non-operating income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On May 7, 2015, we announced that we were selected through a competitive bid process and signed a $98.8 million EPC contract for a geothermal project in Chile. Under the terms of the EPC contract we will provide two air-cooled OECs for a high enthalpy reservoir. The project is scheduled to be completed by mid-2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On April 30, 2015, we announced the closing of an equity transaction with Northleaf Geothermal Holdings, LLC (Northleaf). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, which the parties executed on February 5, 2015, Northleaf acquired a 36.75% equity interest in ORPD for a purchase price of $162.3 million. The joint venture includes Ormat&#39;s Puna geothermal power plant in Hawaii, the Don A. Campbell geothermal power plant in Nevada, and nine power plant units across three recovered energy generation assets known as OREG 1, OREG 2, and OREG 3. The purchase price implies an aggregate equity value for the portfolio of approximately $442.0 million. The actual purchase price and the percentage interest acquired by Northleaf were adjusted based on the Canadian Dollar/US Dollar exchange rate and was affected by the devaluation of the Canadian Dollar. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On March 24, 2015, we announced that we entered into a 20-year PPA with SCPPA for interstate delivery of electricity from the Don A. Campbell phase 2 power plant in Mineral County, Nevada. Under the terms of the PPA, the Don A. Campbell phase 2 power plant will receive a rate of $81.25 per MWh with no annual escalation. The power plant began commercial operation on September 17, 2015. Northleaf Capital Partners, Ormat&#39;s new joint venture investor, will purchase an approximately 36.75% interest in the project which will be added to the existing ORPD projects portfolio once the project is completed and commissioned. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On February 12, 2015, we announced the completion of the share exchange transaction with Ormat Industries, our then-parent company, in which we acquired Ormat Industries through the issuance of 30,203,186 new shares of our common stock to Ormat Industries&#39; shareholders in exchange for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Ormat Industries, reflecting an exchange ratio of 0.2592 shares of our common stock for each ordinary share of Ormat Industries. One of the key consequences of this transaction was that the number of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliated, &#8220;public&#8221; shareholders was increased from approximately 40% to approximately 76% of our total shares outstanding, which we believe should help elevate trading volume and may increase equity coverage. 

&#160; 

As previously disclosed, we entered into several agreements in connection with the share exchange, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Voting agreements with the then principal shareholders of Ormat Industries, FIMI ENRG, Limited Partnership and FIMI ENRG, L.P. (together FIMI) and Bronicki Investments Ltd. (Bronicki), which currently beneficially own approximately 14.91% and 7.76% of our outstanding shares, respectively. Under these voting agreements, FIMI and Bronicki agreed, among other things, to comply in all respects with the Israeli Tax Ruling applicable to the Ormat Industries shareholders. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Voting neutralization agreements with FIMI and Bronicki, whereby FIMI and Bronicki agreed, among other things, to certain restrictions on their shares of our common stock. Among other things, these voting neutralization agreements: 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

require these shareholders to vote all voting securities owned by FIMI and Bronicki and their respective affiliates in excess of 16% and 9%, respectively, of the combined voting power of our shares in proportion to votes cast by the other holders of our voting securities at any time any action is to be taken by our stockholders&#894; 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

prohibit the acquisition of our voting securities by FIMI and Bronicki and their respective affiliates if after giving effect to any such acquisition FIMI and Bronicki and their respective affiliates would beneficially own voting securities representing in the aggregate more than 20% and 12%, respectively, of the combined voting power of our shares&#894; 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

prohibit, prior to January 1, 2017 and subject to certain exceptions, the sale of more than 10% of our voting securities owned in the aggregate by FIMI and Bronicki&#894; 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

allow, following January 1, 2017, the sale of our voting securities owned by FIMI and Bronicki only if they are not acting in concert to sell or, if they are, only with 20 days&#8217; prior written notice to us, subject to certain exceptions for public sales and mergers and acquisitions transactions; and 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

prohibit FIMI and Bronicki from renewing their shareholder rights agreement beyond its current expiration date of May 22, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A registration rights agreement whereby FIMI and Bronicki may, subject to certain limitations, require us to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement to register a public offering of the shares of our common stock held by them, on customary terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.

On February 5, 2015, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (the TASE) approved the listing of our common stock on the TASE beginning on February 10, 2015 and our common stock is now listed on both the NYSE and the TASE. We are still subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE and of the SEC. Under the local regime for dual listing, U.S. listed companies, such as us, can dual-list on the TASE without additional regulatory requirements, using the same periodic reports, financial and other relevant disclosure information that they submit to the SEC and NYSE. However, as a result of the local regime requirements, we have undertaken, as part of the TASE listing, not to issue preferred stock for as long as our shares of common stock are listed on the TASE.

On February 4, 2015, we announced that the second phase of the McGinness Hills geothermal power plant located in Lander County, Nevada began commercial operation. Since February 1, 2015, the complex sells electricity under an amended PPA with NV Energy at a new energy rate of $85.58 per MWh with one percent annual escalator through December 2032. Following resource confirmation and excellent performance of the first phase of McGinness Hills, which had been operational since June 2012, the second phase initiated construction in March 2014. The second phase of the McGinness Hills plant came on line on February 1, 2015.

Operations of our Electricity Segment 

&#160; 

How We Own Our Power Plants . We customarily establish a separate subsidiary to own interests in each power plant. Our purpose in establishing a separate subsidiary for each plant is to ensure that the plant, and the revenues generated by it, will be the only source for repaying indebtedness, if any, incurred to finance the construction or the acquisition (or to refinance the construction or acquisition) of the relevant plant. If we do not own all of the interest in a power plant, we enter into a shareholders agreement or a partnership agreement that governs the management of the specific subsidiary and our relationship with our partner in connection with the specific power plant. Our ability to transfer or sell our interest in certain power plants may be restricted by certain purchase options or rights of first refusal in favor of our power plant partners or the power plant&#8217;s power purchasers and/or certain change of control and assignment restrictions in the underlying power plant and financing documents. All of our domestic geothermal and REG power plants, with the exception of the Puna complex, which is an Exempt Wholesale Generator, are Qualifying Facilities under the PURPA, and are eligible for regulatory exemptions from most provisions of the FPA and certain state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

How We Explore and Evaluate Geothermal Resources . Since 2006, we have expanded our exploration activities, initially in the U.S. and more recently with an increasing focus internationally. It normally takes two to three years from the time we start active exploration of a particular geothermal resource to the time we have an operating production well, assuming we conclude the resource is commercially viable and determine to pursue its development. Exploration activities generally involve the phases described below. 

&#160; 

Initial Evaluation. Identifying and evaluating potential geothermal resources by sampling and studying new areas combined with information available from public and private sources. We generally adhere to the following process, although our process can vary from site to site depending on geological circumstances and prior evaluation: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

We evaluate historic, geologic and geothermal information available from public and private databases, including geothermal, mining, petroleum and academic sources. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

We visit sites, sampling fluids for chemistry if necessary, to evaluate geologic conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

We evaluate available data, and rank prospects in a database according to estimated size and perceived risk. For example, pre-drilled sites with extensive data are considered lower risk than &#8220;green field&#8221; sites. Both prospect types are considered critical for Ormat&#8217;s continued growth. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

We generally create a digital, spatial geographic information systems (GIS) database and 3D geologic model containing all pertinent information, including thermal water temperature gradients derived from historic drilling, geologic mapping information (e.g., formations, structure, alteration, and topography), and any available archival information about the geophysical properties of the potential resource. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

We assess other relevant information, such as infrastructure (e.g., roads and electric transmission lines), natural features (e.g., springs and lakes), and man-made features (e.g., old mines and wells). 

&#160; 

Our initial evaluation is usually conducted by our own staff, although we might engage outside service providers for some tasks from time to time. The costs associated with an initial evaluation vary from site to site, based on various factors, including the acreage involved and the costs, if any, of obtaining information from private databases or other sources. On average, our expenses for an initial evaluation range from approximately $10,000 to $50,000 including travel, chemical analyses, and data acquisition. 

&#160; 

If we conclude, based on the information considered in the initial evaluation, that the geothermal resource could support a commercially viable power plant, taking into account various factors described below, we proceed to land rights acquisition. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Land Acquisition. Acquiring land rights to any geothermal resources our initial evaluation indicates could potentially support a commercially viable power plant, taking into account various factors. For domestic power plants, we either lease or own the sites on which our power plants are located. For our foreign power plants, our lease rights for the plant site are generally contained in the terms of a concession agreement or other contract with the host government or an agency thereof. In certain cases, we also enter into one or more geothermal resource leases (or subleases) or a concession or an option agreement or other agreement granting us the exclusive right to extract geothermal resources from specified areas of land, with the owners (or sublessors) of such land. In some cases we obtain first the exploration license and once certain investment requirements are met, we can obtain the exploitation rights. This usually gives us the right to explore, develop, operate, and maintain the geothermal field, including, among other things, the right to drill wells (and if there are existing wells in the area, to alter them) and build pipelines for transmitting geothermal fluid. In certain cases, the holder of rights in the geothermal resource is a governmental entity and in other cases a private entity. Usually the duration of the lease (or sublease) and concession agreement corresponds to the duration of the relevant PPA, if any. In certain other cases, we own the land where the geothermal resource is located, in which case there are no restrictions on its utilization. Leasehold interests in federal land in the U.S. are regulated by the BLM and the Minerals Management Service. These agencies have rules governing the geothermal leasing process as discussed above under &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. 

&#160; 

For most of our current exploration sites in the U.S., we acquire rights to use geothermal resource through land leases with the BLM, with various states, or through private leases. Under these leases, we typically pay an up-front non-refundable bonus payment, which is a component of the competitive lease process. In addition, we undertake to pay nominal, fixed annual rent payments for the period from the commencement of the lease through the completion of construction. Upon the commencement of power generation, we begin to pay to the lessors long-term royalty payments based on the use of the geothermal resources as defined in the respective agreements. These payments are contingent on the power plant&#8217;s revenues. A summary of our typical lease terms is provided below under &#8220;Description of our Leases and Lands&#8221;. 

&#160; 

The up-front bonus and royalty payments vary from site to site and are based, among other things, on current market conditions. 

&#160; 

Surveys . Conducting geological, geochemical, and/or geophysical surveys on the sites acquired. Following the acquisition of land rights for a potential geothermal resource, we conduct additional surface water analyses, soil surveys, and geologic mapping to determine proximity to possible heat flow anomalies and up-flow/permeable zones. We augment our digital database with the results of those analyses and create conceptual and digital geologic models to describe geothermal system controls. We then initiate a suite of geophysical surveys (e.g., gravity, magnetics, resistivity, magnetotellurics, reflection seismic, LiDAR, and spectral surveys) to assess surface and sub-surface structure (e.g., faults and fractures) and improve the geologic model of fluid-flow conduits and permeability controls. All pertinent geological and geophysical data are used to create three-dimensional geologic models to identify drill locations. These surveys are conducted incrementally considering relative impact and cost, and the geologic model is updated continuously. 

&#160; 

We make a further determination of the commercial viability of the geothermal resource based on the results of this process, particularly the results of the geochemical surveys estimating temperature and the overall geologic model, including potential resource size. If the results from the geochemical surveys are poor (i.e., low derived resource temperatures or poor permeability) or the geologic model indicates small or deep resource, we re-evaluate the commercial viability of the geothermal resource and may not proceed to exploratory drilling. We generally only move forward with those sites that we believe have a high probability for development. 

&#160; 

Exploratory Drilling. Drilling one or more exploratory wells on the high priority, relatively low risk sites to confirm and/or define the geothermal resource. If we proceed to exploratory drilling, we generally use outside contractors to create access roads to drilling sites and related activities. We have continued efforts to reduce exploration costs and therefore, after obtaining drilling permits, we generally drill temperature gradient holes and/or core holes that are lower cost than slim holes (used in the past) using either our own drilling equipment, whenever possible, or outside contractors. If the obtained data supports a conclusion that the geothermal resource can support a commercially viable power plant, it will be used as an observation well to monitor and define the geothermal resource. If the core hole indicates low temperatures or does not support the geologic model of anticipated permeability, it may be plugged and the area reclaimed. In undrilled sites, we typically step up from shallow (500-1000 ft) to deeper (2000-4000 ft) wells as confidence improves. Following proven temperature in core wells, we typically move to slim and/or full size wells to quantify permeability. 

&#160; 

Each year we determine and approve an exploration budget for the entire exploration activity in such year. We prioritize budget allocation between the various geothermal sites based on commercial and geological factors. The costs we incur for exploratory drilling vary from site to site based on various factors, including the accessibility of the drill site, the geology of the site, and the depth of the resource. However, on average, exploration costs, prior to drilling of a full-size well are approximately $1.0 million to $3.0 million for each site, not including land acquisition. However, we only reach such spending levels for sites that proved to be successful in the early stages of the exploration. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

At various points during our exploration activities, we re-assess whether the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant based on information available at that time. Among other things, we consider the following factors: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

New data and interpretations obtained concerning the geothermal resource as our exploration activities proceed, and particularly the expected MW capacity power plant the resource can be expected to support. The MW capacity can be estimated using analogous systems and/or quantitative heat in place estimates until results from drilling and flow tests quantify temperature, permeability, and resulting resource size. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Current and expected market conditions and rates for contracted and merchant electric power in the market(s) to be serviced. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Availability of transmission capacity. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Anticipated costs associated with further exploration activities and the relative risk of failure. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Anticipated costs for design and construction of a power plant at the site. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Anticipated costs for operation of a power plant at the site, particularly taking into account the ability to share certain types of costs (such as control rooms) with one or more other power plants that are, or are expected to be, operating near the site. 

&#160; 

If we conclude that the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant, we proceed to constructing a power plant at the site. 

&#160; 

How We Construct Our Power Plants . The principal phases involved in constructing one of our geothermal power plants are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Drilling production and injection wells. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Designing the well field, power plant, equipment, controls, and transmission facilities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Obtaining any required permits, electrical interconnection and transmission agreements. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Manufacturing (or in the case of equipment we do not manufacture ourselves, purchasing) the equipment required for the power plant. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Assembling and constructing the well field, power plant, transmission facilities, and related facilities. 

&#160; 

It generally takes approximately two years from the time we drill a production well, until the power plant becomes operational. 

&#160; 

Drilling Production and Injection Wells. We consider completing the drilling of first production well as the beginning of our construction phase for a power plant. However, it is not always sufficient for a full release for construction. The number of production wells varies from plant to plant depending, among other things, on the geothermal resource, the projected capacity of the power plant, the power generation equipment to be used and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected through injection wells to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions. We generally drill the wells ourselves although in some cases we use outside contractors. 

&#160; 

The cost for each production and injection well varies depending, among other things, on the depth and size of the well and market conditions affecting the supply and demand for drilling equipment, labor and operators. Our typical cost for each production and injection well is approximately $4.0 million with a range of $1.0 million to $10.0 million. 

&#160; 

Design . We use our own employees to design the well field and the power plant, including equipment that we manufacture and that will be needed for the power plant. The designs vary based on various factors, including local laws, required permits, the geothermal resource, the expected capacity of the power plant and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Permits . We use our own employees and outside consultants to obtain any required permits and licenses for our power plants that are not already covered by the terms of our site leases. The permits and licenses required vary from site to site, and are described below under &#8220;Environmental Permits&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing. Generally, we manufacture most of the power generating unit equipment we use at our power plants. Multiple sources of supply are generally available for all other equipment we do not manufacture. 

&#160; 

Construction. We use our own employees to manage the construction work. For site grading, civil, mechanical, and electrical work we use subcontractors. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2015, in the Electricity segment, we focused on the commencement of operations at the McGinness Hills phase 2 and the Don A. Campbell phase 2 power plants. We continued with construction of the Olkaria III Plant 4. We began construction of the Don A. Campbell phase 2 power plant and the Olkaria III Plant 4 during fiscal year 2014. We began construction of the McGinness Hills phase 2 power plant during fiscal year 2013. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we released for construction the Platanares project in Honduras. We also started development activity in Tungsten and Dixie Meadows projects in Nevada. 

&#160; 

When deciding whether to continue holding lease rights and/or to pursue exploration activity, we diligently prioritize our prospective investments, taking into account resource and probability assessments in order to make informed decisions about whether a particular project will support commercial operations. As a result, during fiscal year 2015, we discontinued exploration activities at ten future prospects, including Kona and Ulupalakua (Maui) in Hawaii, Warm Springs Tribe and Newberry - Twilight in Oregon, Whirlwind Valley in Utah, Argenta, Hycroft and South Jersey in Nevada and Mariman and Quinohuen in Chile. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2014, we discontinued exploration and development activities at seven exploration sites and one development project, including Huu Dumpo in Indonesia, Mount Spurr in Alaska, San Pablo, San Jose II, and Aroma in Chile, Silver Lake, Summer Lake and Foley Hot Springs in Oregon and Wister in California. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2013, we discontinued exploration and development activities at three sites, including Magic Reservoir in Idaho, Wildhorse (Mustang) in Nevada and Drum Mountain in Utah. After conducting exploratory studies at those sites, we concluded that the respective geothermal resources would not support commercial operations. Costs associated with exploration activities at these sites were expensed accordingly (see &#8220;Write-off of Unsuccessful Exploration Activities&#8221; under Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We added to our exploration activities ten, four and two sites during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

How We Operate and Maintain Our Power Plants . In the U.S. we usually employ our subsidiary, Ormat Nevada, to act as operator of our power plants pursuant to the terms of an operation and maintenance agreement. Operation and maintenance of our foreign projects are generally provided by our subsidiary that owns the relevant project. Our operations and maintenance practices are designed to minimize operating costs without compromising safety or environmental standards while maximizing plant flexibility and maintaining high reliability. Our operations and maintenance practices for geothermal power plants seek to preserve the sustainable characteristics of the geothermal resources we use to produce electricity and maintain steady-state operations within the constraints of those resources reflected in our relevant geologic and hydrologic studies. Our approach to plant management emphasizes the operational autonomy of our individual plant or complex managers and staff to identify and resolve operations and maintenance issues at their respective power plants; however each power plant or complex draws upon our available collective resources and experience, and that of our subsidiaries. We have organized our operations such that inventories, maintenance, backup, and other operational functions are pooled within each power plant complex and provided by one operation and maintenance provider. This approach enables us to realize cost savings and enhances our ability to meet our power plant availability goals. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Safety is a key area of concern to us. We believe that the most efficient and profitable performance of our power plants can only be accomplished within a safe working environment for our employees. Our compensation and incentive program includes safety as a factor in evaluating our employees, and we have a well-developed reporting system to track safety and environmental incidents, if any, at our power plants. 

&#160;

How We Sell Electricity . In the U.S., the purchasers of power from our power plants are typically investor-owned electric utility companies. Outside of the U.S., the purchaser is either a state-owned utility or a privately-owned entity and we typically operate our facilities pursuant to rights granted to us by a governmental agency pursuant to a concession agreement. In each case, we enter into long-term contracts (typically, PPAs) for the sale of electricity or the conversion of geothermal resources into electricity. Although previously a power plant&#8217;s revenues under a PPA generally consisted of two payments &#8212; energy payments and capacity payments, our recent PPAs provide for energy payments only. Energy payments are normally based on a power plant&#8217;s electrical output actually delivered to the purchaser measured in kilowatt hours, with payment rates either fixed or indexed to the power purchaser&#8217;s &#8220;avoided&#8221; power costs (i.e., the costs the power purchaser would have incurred itself had it produced the power it is purchasing from third parties) or rates that escalate at a predetermined percentage each year. Capacity payments are normally calculated based on the generating capacity or the declared capacity of a power plant available for delivery to the purchaser, regardless of the amount of electrical output actually produced or delivered. In addition, most of our domestic power plants located in California are eligible for capacity bonus payments under the respective PPAs upon reaching certain levels of generation. 

&#160; 

How We Finance Our Power Plants . Historically we have funded our power plants with a different sources of liquidity such as a combination of non-recourse or limited recourse debt, including lease financing, tax monetization transactions, internally generated cash, which includes funds from operation, as well as proceeds from loans under corporate credit facilities, sale of securities, and sale of membership interests. Such leveraged financing permits the development of power plants with a limited amount of equity contributions, but also increases the risk that a reduction in revenues could adversely affect a particular power plant&#8217;s ability to meet its debt obligations. Leveraged financing also means that distributions of dividends or other distributions by plant subsidiaries to us are contingent on compliance with financial and other covenants contained in the financing documents. 

&#160; 

Non-recourse debt or lease financing refers to debt or lease arrangements involving debt repayments or lease payments that are made solely from the power plant&#8217;s revenues (rather than our revenues or revenues of any other power plant) and generally are secured by the power plant&#8217;s physical assets, major contracts and agreements, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in our affiliate that owns that power plant. These forms of financing are referred to as &#8220;project financing&#8221;. Project financing transactions generally are structured so that all revenues of a power plant are deposited directly with a bank or other financial institution acting as escrow or security deposit agent. These funds are then payable in a specified order of priority set forth in the financing documents to ensure that, to the extent available, they are used to first pay operating expenses, senior debt service (including lease payments) and taxes, and to fund reserve accounts. Thereafter, subject to satisfying debt service coverage ratios and certain other conditions, available funds may be disbursed for management fees or dividends or, where there are subordinated lenders, to the payment of subordinated debt service. 

&#160; 

In the event of a foreclosure after a default, our affiliate that owns the power plant would only retain an interest in the assets, if any, remaining after all debts and obligations have been paid in full. In addition, incurrence of debt by a power plant may reduce the liquidity of our equity interest in that power plant because the equity interest is typically subject both to a pledge in favor of the power plant&#8217;s lenders securing the power plant&#8217;s debt and to transfer and change of control restrictions set forth in the relevant financing agreements. 

&#160; 

Limited recourse debt refers to project financing as described above with the addition of our agreement to undertake limited financial support for our affiliate that owns the power plant in the form of certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities. These obligations and contingent liabilities may take the form of guarantees of certain specified obligations, indemnities, capital infusions and agreements to pay certain debt service deficiencies. To the extent we become liable under such guarantees and other agreements in respect of a particular power plant, distributions received by us from other power plants and other sources of cash available to us may be required to be used to satisfy these obligations. Creditors of a project financing of a particular power plant may have direct recourse to us to the extent of these limited recourse obligations. 

&#160; 

We have also used financing structures to monetize PTCs and other favorable tax benefits derived from the financed power plants and an operating lease arrangement for our Puna complex power plants. 

&#160; 

We have recently used a sale of membership interests in two of our geothermal assets and nine of our REG facilities to fund corporate needs including funds for the construction of new projects. We may use such financing structure in the future. 

&#160; 

How We Mitigate International Political Risk . We generally purchase insurance policies to cover our exposure to certain political risks involved in operating in developing countries, as described below under &#8220;Insurance&#8221;. To date, our political risk insurance policies are with the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, and Zurich Re, a private insurance and re-insurance company . Such insurance policies generally cover, subject to the limitations and restrictions contained therein, 80-90% of our losses resulting from a specified governmental act such as confiscation, expropriation, riots, the inability to convert local currency into hard currency, and, in certain cases, the breach of agreements. We have obtained such insurance for the Olkaria, Zunil and Sarulla projects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Description of Our Leases and Lands 

&#160; 

We have domestic leases on approximately 282,700 acres of federal, state, and private land in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon. The approximate breakdown between federal, state, private leases and owned land is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

76% are leases with the U.S. government, acting through the BLM; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

17% are leases with private landowners and/or leaseholders; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

4% are leases with various states, none of which is currently material; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

3% are owned by us. 

&#160; 

Each of the leases within each of the categories has standard terms and requirements, as summarized below. Internationally, our land position includes approximately 186,000 acres, most of which are geothermal exploration licenses for one prospect in Chile. 

&#160; 

Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Geothermal Leases 

&#160; 

Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with the U.S. government, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on federally-owned land. These leases are made pursuant to the Geothermal Steam Act and the lessor under such leases is the U.S. government, acting through the BLM. 

&#160; 

BLM geothermal leases grant the geothermal lessee the right and privilege to drill for, extract, produce, remove, utilize, sell, and dispose of geothermal resources on certain lands, together with the right to build and maintain necessary improvements thereon. The actual ownership of the geothermal resources and other minerals beneath the land is retained in the federal mineral estate. The geothermal lease does not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to develop the lands, although the geothermal lessee does hold the exclusive right to develop geothermal resources within the lands. The geothermal lessee does not have the right to develop minerals unassociated with geothermal production and cannot prohibit others from developing the minerals present in the lands. The BLM may grant multiple leases for the same lands and, when this occurs, each lessee is under a duty to not unreasonably interfere with the development rights of the other. Because BLM leases do not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, BLM may grant rights to others for activities that do not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee&#8217;s uses of the same land; such other activities may include recreational use, off-road vehicles, and/or wind or solar energy developments. 

&#160; 

Certain BLM leases issued before August 8, 2005 include covenants that require the projects to conduct their operations under the lease in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable laws and BLM directives and to take all mitigating actions required by the BLM to protect the surface of and the environment surrounding the land. Additionally, certain leases contain additional requirements, some of which concern the mitigation or avoidance of disturbance of any antiquities, cultural values or threatened or endangered plants or animals, the payment of royalties for timber, and the imposition of certain restrictions on residential development on the leased land. 

&#160; 

BLM leases entered into after August 8, 2005 require the geothermal lessee to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes impacts to the land, air, water, to cultural, biological, visual, and other resources, and to other land uses or users. The BLM may require the geothermal lessee to perform special studies or inventories under guidelines prepared by the BLM. The BLM reserves the right to continue existing leases and to authorize future uses upon or in the leased lands, including the approval of easements or rights-of-way. Prior to disturbing the surface of the leased lands, the geothermal lessee must contact the BLM to be apprised of procedures to be followed and modifications or reclamation measures that may be necessary. Subject to BLM approval, geothermal lessees may enter into unit agreements to cooperatively develop a geothermal resource. The BLM reserves the right to specify rates of development and to require the geothermal lessee to commit to a communalization or unitization agreement if a common geothermal resource is at risk of being overdeveloped. 

&#160; 

Typical BLM leases issued to geothermal lessees before August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years and will renew so long as geothermal resources are being produced or utilized in commercial quantities, but cannot exceed a period of forty years after the end of the primary term. If at the end of the forty-year period geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease for a second forty-year term, under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years. If the geothermal lessee does not reach commercial production within the primary term, the BLM may grant two five-year extensions if the geothermal lessee: (i) satisfies certain minimum annual work requirements prescribed by the BLM for that lease, or (ii) makes minimum annual payments. Additionally, if the geothermal lessee is drilling a well for the purposes of commercial production, the primary term (as it may have been extended) may be extended for five years and as long thereafter as steam is being produced and used in commercial quantities (meaning the geothermal lessee either begins producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities or has a well capable of producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities and is making diligent efforts to utilize the resource) for thirty-five years. If, at the end of the extended thirty-five year term, geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease for fifty-five years, under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate. 

&#160; 

For BLM leases issued before August 8, 2005, the geothermal lessee is required to pay an annual rental fee (on a per acre basis), which escalates according to a schedule described therein, until production of geothermal steam in commercial quantities has commenced. After such production has commenced, the geothermal lessee is required to pay royalties (on a monthly basis) on the amount or value of (i) steam, (ii) by-products derived from production, and (iii) commercially de-mineralized water sold or utilized by the project (or reasonably susceptible to such sale or use). 

&#160; 

For BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005, (i) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a non-competitive bidding process will pay an annual rental fee equal to $1.00 per acre for the first ten years and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter; and (ii) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a competitive process will pay a rental equal to $2.00 per acre for the first year, $3.00 per acre for the second through tenth year and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter. Rental fees paid before the first day of the year for which the rental is owed will be credited towards royalty payments for that year. For BLM leases issued, effective, or pending on August 5, 2005 or thereafter, royalty rates are fixed between 1.0-2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity during the first ten years of production under the lease. The royalty rate set by the BLM for geothermal resources produced for the commercial generation of electricity but not sold in an arm&#8217;s length transaction is 1.75% for the first ten years of production and 3.5% thereafter. The royalty rate for geothermal resources sold by the geothermal lessee or an affiliate in an arm&#8217;s length transaction is 10.0% of the gross proceeds from the arm&#8217;s length sale. The BLM may readjust the rental or royalty rates at not less than twenty year intervals beginning thirty-five years after the date geothermal steam is produced. 

&#160; 

In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or regulations issued under the Geothermal Steam Act or the terms or stipulations of the lease, the BLM may, 30 days after notice of default is provided to the relevant project, (i) suspend operations until the requested action is taken, or (ii) cancel the lease. 

&#160; 

Private Geothermal Leases 

&#160; 

Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with private parties, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on privately owned land. In many cases, the lessor under these private geothermal leases owns only the geothermal resource and not the surface of the land. 

&#160; 

Typically, the leases grant our project subsidiaries the exclusive right and privilege to drill for, produce, extract, take and remove from the leased land water, brine, steam, steam power, minerals (other than oil), salts, chemicals, gases (other than gases associated with oil), and other products produced or extracted by such project subsidiary. The project subsidiaries are also granted certain non-exclusive rights pertaining to the construction and operation of plants, structures, and facilities on the leased land. Additionally, the project subsidiaries are granted the right to dispose geothermal fluid as well as the right to re-inject into the leased land water, brine, steam, and gases in a well or wells for the purpose of maintaining or restoring pressure in the productive zones beneath the leased land or other land in the vicinity. Because the private geothermal leases do not grant to the lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, the lessor reserves the right to conduct other activities on the leased land in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee&#8217;s uses of the same land, which other activities may include agricultural use (farming or grazing), recreational use and hunting, and/or wind or solar energy developments. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The leases provide for a term consisting of a primary term in the range of five to 30 years, depending on the lease, and so long thereafter as lease products are being produced or the project subsidiary is engaged in drilling, extraction, processing, or reworking operations on the leased land. 

&#160; 

As consideration under most of our project subsidiaries&#8217; private leases, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor a certain specified percentage of the value &#8220;at the well&#8221; (which is not attributable to the enhanced value of electricity generation), gross proceeds, or gross revenues of all lease products produced, saved, and sold on a monthly basis. In certain of our project subsidiaries&#8217; private leases, royalties payable to the lessor by the project subsidiary are based on the gross revenues received by the lessee from the sale or use of the geothermal substances, either from electricity production or the value of the geothermal resource &#8220;at the well&#8221;. 

&#160; 

In addition, pursuant to the leases, the project subsidiary typically agrees to commence drilling, extraction or processing operations on the leased land within the primary term, and to conduct such operations with reasonable diligence until lease products have been found, extracted and processed in quantities deemed &#8220;paying quantities&#8221; by the project subsidiary, or until further operations would, in such project subsidiary&#8217;s judgment, be unprofitable or impracticable. The project subsidiary has the right at any time within the primary term to terminate the lease and surrender the relevant land. If the project subsidiary has not commenced any such operations on said land (or on the unit area, if the lease has been unitized), or terminated the lease within the primary term, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor, in order to maintain its lease position, annually in advance, a rental fee until operations are commenced on the leased land. 

&#160; 

If the project subsidiary fails to pay any installment of royalty or rental when due and if such default continues for a period of fifteen days specified in the lease, for example, after its receipt of written notice thereof from the lessor, then at the option of the lessor, the lease will terminate as to the portion or portions thereof as to which the project subsidiary is in default. If the project subsidiary defaults in the performance of any obligations under the lease, other than a payment default, and if, for a period of 90 days after written notice is given to it by the lessor of such default, the project subsidiary fails to commence and thereafter diligently and in good faith take remedial measures to remedy such default, the lessor may terminate the lease. 

&#160; 

We do not regard any property that we lease as material unless and until we begin construction of a power plant on the property, that is, until we drill a production well on the property. 

&#160; 

Exploration Concessions in Chile 

&#160; 

We were awarded six exploration concessions in Chile, under which we had the rights to start exploration work with an original term of two years. Prior to the last six months of the original term of each exploration concession, we could request its extension for an additional period of two years. According to applicable regulations, the extension of the exploration concession is subject to the receipt by the Ministry of Energy of evidence that at least 25% of the planned investments for the execution of the project, as reflected in the relevant proposal submitted during the tender process, has been invested. Following submission of the request, the Ministry of Energy has three months in which it may grant or deny the extension. After conducting exploratory studies in those sites, we concluded that the geothermal resource would not support commercial operations at that time and we have waived five of the six concessions we held. Costs associated with exploration activities at these sites were expensed accordingly (see &#8220;Write-off of Unsuccessful Exploration Activities&#8221; under Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;). As of the date of this annual report we have the exclusive right to apply for an exploitation license for the remaining site. Our exclusive right will expire on March 7, 2016, and obtaining such license is subject to approval by the Ministry of Energy.

Material Equipment Two air cooled OEC units with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The Phase 1 power plant is in its second year of operation and the Phase 2 power plant commenced operation in September 2015. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The Don A. Campbell area is comprised of BLM leases. &#160; &#160; &#160; Since we declared commercial operation, the leases are held by production, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; The project&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The Don A. Campbell geothermal reservoir consists of highly fractured, silicified alluvium over at least two square miles. Production and injection are very shallow with five pumped production wells (from depths of 1,350 feet to 1,900 feet) and three injection wells (from depths of 649 feet to 2,477 feet), all targeting northwest-dipping fractures. The thermal fluids are thought to be controlled by a combination of conductive heat transfer from deeper bedrock and through mixing of upwelling thermal fluids from a deeper geothermal system also contained in the bedrock. The system is considered blind with no surface expression of thermal features. &#160; &#160; &#160; The temperature of the resource is approximately 262 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling Since the beginning of operation, the resource temperature has been stable. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted in leases from BLM. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Two separate PPAs with SCPPA &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date The Phase 1 PPA expires in 2034 and the Phase 2 PPA expires in 2036 &#160; &#160; Financing Corporate funds and cash grant for Phase 1 that we received from the U.S. Treasury. &#160; &#160; Suppl emental Information In April 2015, we closed an equity transaction with Northleaf in which Northleaf acquired a 36.75% equity interest in ORPD.

The resource supplying the pumped Heber 2 wells averages 317 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; &#160; Heber production is from deltaic sedimentary sandstones deposited in the subsiding Salton Trough of California&#8217;s Imperial Valley. Produced fluids rise from near the magmatic heated basement rocks (18,000 feet) via fault/fracture zones to the near surface. Heber 1 wells produce directly from deep (4,000 to 8,000 feet) fracture zones. Heber 2 wells produce from the nearer surface (2,000 to 4,000 feet) matrix permeability sandstones in the horizontal outflow plume fed by the fractures from below and the surrounding ground waters. &#160; &#160; &#160; Scale deposition in the flashing Heber 1 producers is controlled by down hole chemical inhibition supplemented with occasional mechanical cleanouts and acid treatments. There is no scale deposition in the Heber 2 production wells. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling An average of one degree Fahrenheit per year was observed during the past 20 years of production. &#160; &#160; Sources of Makeup Water Water is provided by condensate and by the IID. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser One PPA with Southern California Edison and two PPAs with SCPPA. &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date Heber 1 &#8212; 2026, Heber 2 &#8212; 2023, and Heber South &#8212; 2031.

The leases are held by production. The scheduled expiration dates for all of these leases are after the end of the expected useful life of the power plant. &#160; &#160; &#160; The power plant&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from leased property and access across leased property under surface rights granted in leases from BLM. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The Jersey Valley geothermal reservoir consists of a small high-permeability area surrounded by a large low-permeability area. The high-permeability area has been defined by wells drilled along an interpreted fault trending west-northwest. Static water levels are artesian; two of the wells along the permeable zone have very high productivities, as indicated by Permeability Index (PI) values exceeding 20 gpm/psi. The average temperature of the resource is 316 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling The rate of cooling was four degree Fahrenheit in 2015 but it has been moderating since injection in a well near the production wells was reduced and injection was increased at injection wells farther away by increasing injection pressure. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Nevada Power Company &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2032 &#160; &#160; Financing Corporate funds and ITC cash grant from the U.S. Treasury. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Mammoth Complex &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Mammoth Lakes, California &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 29 MW &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants Three (G-1, G-2, and G-3). &#160; &#160; Technology The Mammoth complex utilizes air cooled binary systems. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements Ten production wells and five injection wells are connected to the plants through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment Two new OECs and six Turbo-expanders together with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The G-1 plant commenced commercial operations in 1984 and the G-2 and G-3 power plants commenced commercial operation in 1990. We recently replaced the equipment at the G-1 plant with new OECs. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The total Mammoth area is comprised mainly of BLM leases. The leases are held by production. The scheduled expiration dates for all of these leases are after the end of the expected useful life of the power plants. &#160; &#160; &#160; The complex&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted pursuant to the leases. &#160; &#160;

&#160; 

Resource Information The average resource temperature is 339 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; &#160; The Casa Diablo/Basalt Canyon geothermal field at Mammoth lies on the southwest edge of the resurgent dome within the Long Valley Caldera. It is believed that the present heat source for the geothermal system is an active magma body underlying the Mammoth Mountain to the northwest of the field. Geothermal waters heated by the magma flow from a deep source (greater than 3,500 feet) along faults and fracture zones from northwest to southeast east into the field area. &#160; &#160; &#160; The produced fluid has no scaling potential. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling In the last three years the temperature has stabilized and there is no notable decline, although one degree Fahrenheit per year was observed during the prior 20 years of production. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser G1 and G3 plants - PG&#38;E and G2 plant -Southern California Edison. &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date G-1 and G-3 plants 2034 and G-2 plant 2027. &#160; &#160; Financing OFC Senior Secured Notes and ORTP Transaction. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; McGinness Hills Complex &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Lander County, Nevada &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 83 MW (after the 11 MW phase 2 power plant became operational on February 1, 2015) &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants Two &#160; &#160; Technology The McGinness Hills complex utilizes an air cooled binary system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements 10 production wells and five injection wells are connected to the power plant. &#160; &#160; Material Equipment Six air cooled OEC units with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The first phase commenced commercial operation on July 1, 2012, and the second phase on February 1, 2015. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The McGinness Hills area is comprised of private and BLM leases. &#160; &#160; &#160; The leases require annual rental payments, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; The rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The McGinness Hills geothermal reservoir is contained within a network of fractured rocks over an area at least three square miles. The reservoir is contained in both Tertiary intrusive and Paleozoic sedimentary (basement) rocks. The thermal fluids within the reservoir are inferred to flow upward through the basement rocks along the NNE-striking faults at several fault intersections. The thermal fluids then generally outflow laterally to the NNE and SSW along the NNE-striking faults. No modern thermal manifestations exist at McGinness Hills, although hot spring deposits encompass an area of approximately 0.25 square miles and indicate a history of surface thermal fluid flow. The resource temperature averages 335 degrees Fahrenheit and the fluids are sourced from the reservoir at elevations between 2,000 to 5,000 feet below the surface. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling The temperature has been stable since the first phase began operation with no notable cooling. &#160; &#160;

One &#160; &#160; Technology The North Brawley power plant utilizes a water-cooled binary system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements 36 wells have been drilled and are connected to the plants through its gathering system. As we improved our knowledge of the reservoir, we moved some of the wells between production and injection and left some idle. Currently, we have 13 wells connected to the production header and 23 wells, connected to the injection header. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment Five OEC units together with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The power plant commenced commercial operation on March 31, 2011. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The total North Brawley area is comprised of private leases. The leases are held by production. The scheduled expiration date for all of these leases is after the end of the expected useful life of the power plant. &#160; &#160; &#160; The plant&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted pursuant to the leases. &#160; &#160; Resource Information North Brawley production is from deltaic and marine sedimentary sands and sandstones deposited in the subsiding Salton Trough of the Imperial Valley. Based on seismic refraction surveys the total thickness of these sediments in the Brawley area is over 15,000 feet. The shallow production reservoir (from depths of 1,500 to 4,500 feet) that was developed is fed by fractures and matrix permeability and is conductively heated from the underlying fractured reservoir which convectively circulates magmatically heated fluid. Produced fluid salinity ranges from 20,000 to 50,000 ppm, and the moderate scaling and corrosion potential is chemically inhibited. The temperature of the deeper fractured reservoir fluids exceed 525 degrees Fahrenheit, but the fluid is not yet developed because of severe scaling and corrosion potential. The deep reservoir is not dedicated to the North Brawley power plant. &#160; &#160; &#160; The average produced fluid resource temperature is 327 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling Temperature depends on operating production wells and declined 8 degrees last year. &#160; &#160; Sources of Makeup Water &#160; Water is provided by the IID. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Southern California Edison &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2031 &#160; &#160;

Financing Corporate funds and ITC cash grant from the U.S. Treasury. &#160; &#160; Supplemental Information Since the North Brawley power plant was placed in service in 2010, it has been much more difficult to operate its geothermal field than other fields, and the power plant has been unable to reach its design capacity of 50 MW. Instead, it has been operating at capacities between 15 MW and 33 MW. This generation level has been achieved following significant additional capital expenditures and a higher than anticipated operating costs. &#160; &#160; &#160; We are currently selling the power generated by the North Brawley plant to Southern California Edison under the existing PPA at a capacity level of approximately 16 MW and we are planning to increase it to 18 MW by 2017. We intend to refrain from additional capital investment to expand the capacity and significantly reduced the operational costs of the North Brawley power plant until further geological analysis is completed and/or a higher energy rate is secured. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; OREG 1 Power Plant &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Four gas compressor stations along the Northern Border natural gas pipeline in North and South Dakota. &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 22 MW &#160; &#160; Number of Units Four &#160; &#160; Technology The OREG 1 power plant utilizes our air cooled OEC units. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment Four WHOH and four OEC units together with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The OREG 1 power plant commenced commercial operations in 2006. &#160; &#160; Land Easement from NBPL. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to the plant from public roads. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Basin Electric Power Cooperative &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2031 &#160; &#160; Financing Corporate funds. &#160; &#160; Supplemental Information In April 2015, we closed an equity transaction with Northleaf in which Northleaf acquired a 36.75% equity interest in ORPD.

The GEM 2 plant was taken off line during 2015 due to plant operation optimization. &#160; &#160; Technology The OG plants utilize a binary system and the GEM plant utilize a flash system. The complex uses a water cooling system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements 24 production wells and 57 injection wells connected to the plants through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Material Major Equipment 8 OEC units and one steam turbines with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The various OG I plants commenced commercial operations between 1987 and 1989, and the OG II plant commenced commercial operation in 1988. Between 2005 and 2007 a significant portion of the old equipment in the OG plants was replaced (including turbines through repowering). The GEM plant commenced commercial operation in 1989, and a new bottoming unit was added in 2007. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The total Ormesa area is comprised of BLM leases. The leases are held by production. The scheduled expiration dates for all of these leases are after the end of the expected useful life of the power plants. &#160; &#160; &#160; The complex&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted pursuant to the leases. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The resource temperature is an average of 310 degrees Fahrenheit. Production is from sandstones. &#160; &#160; &#160; Productive sandstones are between 1,800 and 6,000 feet, and have only matrix permeability. The currently developed thermal anomaly was created in geologic time by conductive heating and direct outflow from an underlying convective fracture system. Produced fluid salinity ranges from 2,000 ppm to 13,000 ppm, and minor scaling and corrosion potential is chemically inhibited. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling One degree Fahrenheit per year was observed during the past 20 years of production however, following shutdown of cold wells during 2015, temperature increased by approximately six degrees. &#160; &#160; Sources of Makeup Water Water is provided by the IID. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Southern California Edison under a single PPA. &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date December 2017 &#160; &#160; Financing OFC Senior Secured Notes and ORTP Transaction. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Puna Complex &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Puna district, Big Island, Hawaii &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 38 MW &#160; &#160;

Number of Power Plants Two &#160; &#160; Technology The Puna plants utilize our geothermal combined cycle and binary systems. The plants use an air cooled system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements Six production wells and five injection wells connected to the plants through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment One plant consists of ten OEC units made up of ten binary turbines, ten steam turbines and two bottoming units along with the Balance of Plant equipment. The second plant consists of two OEC units along with Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The first plant commenced commercial operations in 1993. The second plant was placed in service in 2011 and commenced commercial operation in 2012. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The Puna complex is comprised of a private lease. The private lease is between PGV and KLP and it expires in 2046. PGV pays an annual rental payment to KLP, which is adjusted every five years based on the CPI. &#160; &#160; &#160; The state of Hawaii owns all mineral rights (including geothermal resources) in the state. The state has issued a Geothermal Resources Mining Lease to KLP, and KLP in turn has entered into a sublease agreement with PGV, with the state&#8217;s consent. Under this arrangement, the state receives royalties of approximately three percent of the gross revenues. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to the leased property is readily available via county public roads located adjacent to the leased property. The public roads are at the north and south boundaries of the leased property. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The geothermal reservoir at Puna is located in volcanic rock along the axis of the Kilauea Lower East Rift Zone. Permeability and productivity are controlled by rift-parallel subsurface fissures created by volcanic activity. They may also be influenced by lens-shaped bodies of pillow basalt which have been postulated to exist along the axis of the rift at depths below 7,000 feet. &#160; &#160; &#160; The distribution of reservoir temperatures is strongly influenced by the configuration of subsurface fissures and temperatures are among the hottest of any geothermal field in the world, with maximum measured temperatures consistently above 650 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling The resource temperature is stable. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Three PPAs with HELCO (see &#8220;Supplemental Information&#8221; below). &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2027 &#160; &#160; Financing Operating Lease and ITC cash grant from the U.S. Treasury.

Campbell phase 1 power plant, and the OREG 1, OREG 2, and OREG 3 power plants. Discussed in Item 7 - &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;ORPD transaction&#8221;. &#160; &#160; Supplemental Information The pricing for the energy that is sold from the Puna complex is as follows: &#160;

&#160; &#8226; For the first on-peak 25 MW, the energy price has not changed from HELCO avoided cost. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; For the next on-peak 5 MW, the price has changed from a diesel-based price to a flat rate of 11.8 cents per kWh escalated by 1.5% per year. &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; For the new on-peak 8 MW, the price is 9 cents per kWh for up to 30,000 MWh/year and 6 cents per kWh above 30,000 MWh/year, escalated by 1.5% per year. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; For the first off-peak 22 MW the energy price has not changed from avoided cost. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The off-peak energy above 22 MW is dispatchable: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1. For the first off-peak 5 MW, the price has changed from diesel-based price to a flat rate of 11.8 cents per kWh escalated by 1.5% per year. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. For the energy above 27 MW (up to 38 MW) the price is 6 cents per kWh, escalated by 1.5% per year. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The capacity payment for the first 30 MW remains the same ($160 kW/year for the first 25 MW and $100.95 kW/year for the additional 5 MW). For the new 8MW power plant the annual capacity payment is $2 million. &#160;

&#160; &#160; Steamboat Complex &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Steamboat, Washoe County, Nevada &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 73 MW &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants Six (Steamboat 2 and 3, Burdette (Galena 1), Steamboat Hills, Galena 2 and Galena 3). &#160; &#160; Technology The Steamboat complex utilizes a binary system (except for Steamboat Hills, which utilizes a single flash system). The complex uses air and water cooling systems. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements 24 production wells and 10 injection wells connected to the plants through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment 10 individual air cooled OEC units and one steam turbine together with the Balance of Plant Equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The power plants commenced commercial operation in 1992, 2005, 2007 and 2008. During 2008, the Rotoflow expanders at Steamboat 2 and 3 were replaced with four turbines manufactured by us. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The total Steamboat area is comprised of 41% private leases, 41% BLM leases and 18% private land owned by us. The leases are held by production. The scheduled expiration dates for all of these leases are after the end of the expected useful life of the power plants. &#160; &#160; &#160; The complex&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; We have easements for the transmission lines we use to deliver power to our power purchasers. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The resource temperature is an average of 283 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; &#160; The Steamboat geothermal field is a typical basin and range geothermal reservoir. Large and deep faults that occur in the rocks allow circulation of ground water to depths exceeding 10,000 feet below the surface. Horizontal zones of permeability permit the hot water to flow eastward in an out-flow plume. &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; The Steamboat Hills and Galena 2 power plants produce hot water from fractures associated with normal faults. The rest of the power plants acquire their geothermal water from the horizontal out-flow plume. &#160; &#160; &#160; The water in the Steamboat reservoir has a low total solids concentration. Scaling potential is very low unless the fluid is allowed to flash which will result in calcium carbonate scale. Injection of cooled water for reservoir pressure maintenance prevents flashing. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling Historically, the resource temperature declined at two degrees Fahrenheit per year, however, since the expansion of the complex, the rate of decline has been approximately five degrees Fahrenheit per year (see &#8220;Supplemental Information&#8221; below). In 2015 temperature decline moderated to two degrees Fahrenheit since three injection wells were shut down in 2014. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted pursuant to the leases. &#160; &#160; Sources of Makeup Water Water is provided by condensate and the local utility. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Sierra Pacific Power Company (for Steamboat 2 and 3, Burdette (Galena1), Steamboat Hills, and Galena 3) and Nevada Power Company (for Galena 2). &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date Steamboat 2 and 3 &#8212; 2022, Burdette (Galena1) &#8212; 2026, Steamboat Hills &#8212; 2018, Galena 3 &#8212; 2028, and Galena 2 &#8212; 2027. &#160; &#160; Financing OFC Senior Secured Notes and ORTP Transaction (Steamboat 2 and 3, and Burdette (Galena1)) and OPC Transaction (Steamboat Hills, Galena 2, and Galena 3) &#160; &#160; Supplemental information In an attempt to increase the output of the plant we have acquired land adjacent to the complex and are evaluating a resource development program on that land. Tracer tests and reservoir modeling showed that three injection wells were causing most of the cooling. We shut down these wells and drilled a new injection well in 2014, which we expect will reduce the complex cooling. One production well was connected to the plant and in 2016 we intend to tie in the new injection well that was drilled in 2014. We are planning to further optimize the field in 2016 to reduce cooling and maximize power output. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Tuscarora Power Plant &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Elko County, Nevada &#160; &#160; Projected Generating Capacity 18 MW &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants One &#160; &#160; Technology The Tuscarora power plant utilizes a water cooled binary system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements Three production and six injection wells are connected to the power plant. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment Two water cooled OEC units with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The power plant commenced commercial operation on January 11, 2012. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The Tuscarora area is comprised of private and BLM leases. &#160; &#160; &#160; The leases are currently held by payment of annual rental payments, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; The plant&#8217;s rights to use the geothermal and surface rights under the leases are subject to various conditions, as described above in &#8220;Description of Our Leases and Lands&#8221;. &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Resource Information The Tuscarora geothermal reservoir consists of an area of approximately 2.5 square miles. The reservoir is contained in both Tertiary and Paleozoic (basement) rocks. The Paleozoic section consists primarily of sedimentary rocks, overlain by tertiary volcanic rocks. Thermal fluid in the native state of the reservoir flows upward and to the north through apparently southward-dipping, basement formations. At an elevation of roughly 2,500 feet with respect to mean sea level, the upwelling thermal fluid enters the tertiary volcanic rocks and flows directly upward, exiting to the surface at Hot Sulphur Springs. &#160; &#160; &#160; The resource temperature averages 337 degrees Fahrenheit. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling We expect gradual decline in the cooling trend from two degrees Fahrenheit per year in the next two to three years, to less than one degree Fahrenheit per year over the long term. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted in leases from BLM. &#160; &#160; Sources of Makeup Water Water is provided from five water makeup wells. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser Nevada Power Company &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2032 &#160; &#160; Financing OFC 2 Senior Secured Notes and ITC cash grant from the U.S. Treasury. &#160; &#160; Supplemental information Due to the draught years, supply of make-up water for the plant cooling system is declining. With the increase in ambient temperatures, during the summer months we have experienced shortfall at levels that required at certain times reduction in plant generation. Engineering efforts for plant reconfiguration for partial air cooling are in progress. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign Operating Power Plants &#160; &#160; &#160; The following descriptions summarize certain industry metrics for our foreign operating power plants: &#160; &#160; Amatitlan Power Plant (Guatemala) &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Amatitlan, Guatemala &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 20 MW &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants One &#160; &#160; Technology The Amatitlan power plant utilizes an air cooled binary system and a small back pressure steam turbine (1 MW). &#160; &#160; Subsurface Improvements Five production wells and two injection wells connected to the plants through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment One steam turbine and two OEC units together with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The plant commenced commercial operation in 2007. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights Total resource concession area (under usufruct agreement with INDE) is for a term of 25 years from April 2003. Leased and company owned property is approximately three percent of the concession area.

&#160; The Olkaria III geothermal field is on the west side of the greater Olkaria geothermal area located at approximately 6,890 feet above sea level within the Rift Valley. &#160; &#160; &#160; Hot geothermal fluids rise up from deep in the northeastern portion of the concession area, penetrating a low permeability zone below 3,280 feet above sea level to a high productivity, two-phase zone identified between 3,280 and 4,270 feet ASL. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling The resource temperature is stable. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads from the leased property and access across the leased property are provided under surface rights granted pursuant to the lease agreement. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser KPLC &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date Plant 1 and 2 in 2033, Plant 3 in 2034 and Plant 4 in 2036 &#160; &#160; Financing Senior secured project finance loan from OPIC and a subordinated loan from DEG. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Zunil Power Plant (Guatemala) &#160; &#160; &#160; Location &#160; Zunil, Guatemala &#160; &#160; Generating Capacity 23 MW (see Supplemental Information below for information on current generating capacity) &#160; &#160; Number of Power Plants One &#160; &#160; Technology The Zunil power plant utilizes an air cooled binary system. &#160; &#160; Subsurface Six production wells and two injection wells are connected to the plant through a gathering system. &#160; &#160; Major Equipment Seven OEC units together with the Balance of Plant equipment. &#160; &#160; Age The plant commenced commercial operation in 1999. &#160; &#160; Land and Mineral Rights The land owned by the plant includes the power plant, workshop and open yards for equipment and pipes storage. &#160; &#160; &#160; Pipelines for the gathering system transit through a local agricultural area&#8217;s right of way acquired by us. &#160; &#160; &#160; The geothermal wells and resource are owned by INDE. &#160; &#160; &#160; Our produced power is sold at our property line; power transmission lines are owned and operated by INDE. &#160; &#160; Resource Information The Zunil geothermal reservoir is hosted in Tertiary volcanic rocks which include overly fractured granodiorite. Production wells produce a reservoir from 536-572 degrees Fahrenheit to a depth of approximately 2,860-4,300 feet. A shallow steam cap exists in the production area of the field, and most of the wells produce high enthalpy fluid due to the presence of two-phase conditions in their feed zones. The wells target northwest- and northeast-trending fractures for permeability. These fractures are also thought to control upwelling from the volcanically-heated source. The upwelling fluids form a steam cap, and fluids and steam reach the surface along fractures, forming springs and fumaroles throughout the geothermal field. &#160; &#160; Resource Cooling The resource temperature is stable. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Direct access to public roads. &#160; &#160;

Power Purchaser INDE &#160; &#160; PPA Expiration Date 2034 &#160; &#160; Supplemental Information In January 2014, we signed an amendment with INDE to extend the term of the PPA by 15 years until 2034. &#160; &#160; &#160; The PPA amendment also transfers operation and management responsibilities of the Zunil geothermal field from INDE to Ormat for the term of the amended PPA in exchange for an increase in tariff. Additionally, INDE exercised its right under the PPA to become a partner in the Zunil power plant and to hold a three percent equity interest. &#160; &#160; &#160; The power plant generates approximately 16 MW due to lack of sufficient geothermal resource supply. We successfully improved the heat supply and gradually increased the generation. We expect that this improvement and the increased tariff will increase the energy portion of revenues. We drilled a new production well in 2015 that increased the output of the power plant to its current level. &#160; &#160; &#160; According to the PPA amendment, payments for the Zunil plant will be made as follows: &#160;

&#160;

1.

Capacity payment:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

a.

Until 2019, the capacity payment will be calculated based on 24 MW capacity regardless of the actual performance of the power plant. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

b.

From 2019 and onwards, the capacity payment will be based on actual delivered capacity and the capacity rate will be reduced.

&#160;

&#160;

2.

Energy payment:

&#160;

&#160;

The project is located within a geothermal concession granted by the Department of Energy, Natural Resources, Environment, and Mines (SERNA), and located on fee land owned by GeoPlatanares and on land under lease from various private and public entities. The concession conveys to GeoPlatanares the right to exploit the geothermal resources contained within. The transmission corridor consists of easement agreements between GeoPlatanares and various private and public entities. 

&#160;

&#160;

Resource Information 

The project is located along a narrow river valley in western Honduras. The field is covered mostly by Miocene volcanic deposits. Numerous boiling hot springs and fumaroles emit along active faults along an area around two miles in length. The geothermal reservoir is supported by highly fractured volcanic and metasedimentary rock units. Wells are less than 800 meter deep.

&#160;

&#160;

Access to Property 

Public roads provide access to the project area. In order to improve access for heavy equipment and large loads, GeoPlatanares has entered into a lease agreement with a private landowner for a small segment of road linking two leased parcels

&#160; &#160; Financing Corporate funds during construction. &#160; &#160; Supplemental Information We hold the assets, including the project&#8217;s wells, land, permits and a PPA, under a BOT structure for 15 years from the date of commercial operation. Commercial operation is expected at the end of 2017. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sarulla (Indonesia) &#160; &#160; &#160; Location Tapanuli Utara North Sumatra, Indonesia. One site is located in Silangkitan (SIL) and the two other sites in Namura I Langit (NIL) area. &#160; &#160; Ownership Sarulla Operation LTD (SOL) is a consortium consists of Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, Inpex Corporation, Itochu Corporation, Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc., and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries that hold 12.75% interest. &#160; &#160; Projected Generating Capacity Approximately 330 MW &#160; &#160; Projected Technology Integrated Geothermal Combined Cycle Unit comprised of 3 back pressure steam turbines and 18 OEC units. &#160; &#160; Condition Engineering and procurement for the first phase has been completed but is still in progress for the other two phases. Construction for the first phase is in progress. The infrastructure work has been substantially completed. Major equipment, including Ormat&#8217;s OECs and Toshiba&#8217;s steam turbine, for the first phase has arrived to the country and much of the equipment is already at the site. The drilling of production and injection wells is also in progress for all three phases, but currently the project company is experiencing some delays mainly in meeting some of the drilling milestones, as well as certain EPC milestones. It should also be noted that the project is facing certain cost overruns, resulting mainly from drilling. The consortium members are examining the significance of these cost overruns and their potential implications for the project&#39;s budget as well as for the financing of the project since the cost overruns and drilling delays may impact the project&#39;s ability to draw on the debt financing and force additional equity investment by the consortium members. All contractual milestones under Ormat&#8217;s supply agreement were achieved and the manufacturing work is currently progressing as planned. &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Land and Mineral Rights Most of the land for the project was acquired from private owners with some land leased from governmental agencies. &#160; &#160; Resource Information Two field areas, NIL and SIL host a liquid-dominated system. Previously drilled wells have temperatures from 275&#176;C to 310&#176;C. Flow tests of the first SOL partnership well, N2n-1, predict 22 NMW single well capacity with 751 T/hr total flow and 125 T/hr steam flow at 12.5 bar and 1126 kJ/kg. Both fields are within a tectonic half graven adjacent to the Great Sumatran Fault. In addition to highly encouraging production results, extensive surface manifestations, including fumaroles, boiling hot springs, and alteration, highlight an extensive area of productivity. &#160; &#160; Access to Property Access to property for the project has been secured. &#160; &#160; Power Purchaser 

30-year Energy Sales Contract with PT PLN (the state electric utility)

Future Projects &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Projects under Various Stages of Development 

&#160; 

We also have projects under various stages of development in the U.S., and Kenya. We expect to continue to explore these and other opportunities for expansion so long as they continue to meet our business objectives and investment criteria. 

&#160; 

The following is a description of the projects currently under various stages of development and for which we are able to estimate their expected generating capacity. Upon completion of these projects, the generating capacity of the geothermal projects would be up to approximately 90 MW (representing our interest). However, we prioritize our investments based on their readiness for continued construction and expected economics and therefore we are not planning to invest in all of such projects in 2016. 

&#160; 

e-Bay REG Project (U.S.) 

&#160; 

In September 2013, we entered a Joint Development Agreement with eBay Inc. for the development of a five-megawatt REG power plant to be constructed in Utah. The Joint Development Agreement allows Ormat and eBay Inc. to advance negotiations on a 20-year term contract and begin preliminary development work to supply cleaner electricity to eBay Inc.&#39;s new Salt Lake City-based data center. 

&#160; 

Tungsten Mountain (Nevada) &#160; 

&#160; 

We are developing the Tungsten Mountain project on BLM leases located in Churchill County, Nevada. We expect the project to be between 25 to 35 MW. 

&#160; &#160; 

We have drilled several exploration wells and drilling activity is ongoing. We secured an interconnection agreement and are in final stages of obtaining the major construction permits. We signed a non-binding letter of intent with a potential California off-taker and expect to secure a PPA in 2016. We expect to reach commercial operation in 2017. 

&#160; 

Dixie Meadows (Nevada) 

&#160; &#160; 

We are developing the Dixie Meadows project on BLM leases located in Churchill County, Nevada. We expect the project to be between 25 to 35 MW. 

&#160; 

We have drilled several exploration wells and drilling activity is ongoing. We secured an interconnection agreement and are in advanced stages of obtaining the major construction permits. PPA is expected to be secured in 2016. We expect to reach commercial operation in 2017 or 2018 . 

&#160; 

Menengai Project ( Kenya) 

&#160; 

On November 3, 2014, our majority owned Kenyan subsidiary (the Project Company) owned by Ormat (51%), Symbion Power LLC (24.5%) and Civicon Ltd. (24.5%), signed a 25-year PPA with KPLC and a project implementation and steam supply agreement (PISSA) with GDC for the 35 MW Menengai geothermal project in Kenya. 

&#160; 

Under the PISSA agreement, the Project Company will finance, design, construct, install, operate and maintain the 35 MW Menengai steam plant on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis for 25 years. GDC, which is wholly owned by the Government of Kenya, will develop the geothermal resource, supply the steam for conversion to electricity and maintain the geothermal field through the term of the agreement. The Project Company expects to start construction upon financial closing. 

&#160; 

Future Prospects 

&#160; 

We have a substantial land position that is expected to support future development on which we have started or plan to start exploration activity. When deciding whether to continue holding lease rights and/or to pursue exploration activity, we diligently prioritize our prospective investments, taking into account resource and probability assessments in order to make informed decisions about whether a particular project will support commercial operations. As a result, during fiscal year 2015, we discontinued exploration activities at ten future prospects, including Kona and Ulupalakua (Maui) in Hawaii, Warm Springs Tribe and Newberry - Twilight in Oregon, Whirlwind Valley in Utah, Argenta, Hycroft and South Jersey in Nevada and Mariman and Quinohuen in Chile. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our current land position is comprised of various leases and private land for geothermal resources of approximately 159,000 acres in 29 prospects including the following:

Operations of our Product Segment 

&#160; 

Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants . We design, manufacture, and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. Our customers include contractors and geothermal plant owners and operators. 

&#160; 

The power units are usually paid for in installments, in accordance with milestones set in the supply agreement. Sometimes we agree to provide the purchaser with spare parts (or alternatively, with a non-exclusive license to manufacture such parts). We provide the purchaser with at least a 12-month warranty for such products. We usually also provide the purchaser (often, upon receipt of advances made by the purchaser) with a guarantee, which expires in part upon delivery of the equipment to the site and fully expires at the termination of the warranty period. The guarantees are typically supported by letters of credit. 

&#160; 

Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation. We design, manufacture, and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy or so-called &#8220;waste heat&#8221;. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, and other companies engaged in other energy-intensive industrial processes. We have two different business models for this product line. 

&#160; 

&#9679; The first business model, which is similar to the model utilized in our geothermal power generation business, consists of the development, construction, ownership, and operation of recovered energy-based generation power plants. In this case, we will enter into agreements to purchase industrial waste heat, and enter into long-term PPAs with off-takers to sell the electricity generated by the REG unit that utilizes such industrial waste heat. The power purchasers in such cases generally are investor-owned electric utilities or local electrical cooperatives. This is the business model for our OREG 1, 2, 3 and 4 power plants. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Pursuant to the second business model, we construct and sell the power units for recovered energy-based power generation to third parties for use in &#8220;inside-the-fence&#8221; installations or otherwise. Our customers include gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators and companies in the process industry. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Remote Power Units and other Generators. We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. The remote power units supply energy for remote and unmanned installations and along communications lines, and cathodic protection along gas and oil pipelines. Our customers include contractors installing gas pipelines in remote areas. In addition, we manufacture and sell generators, including heavy duty direct current generators, for various other uses. The terms of sale of the turbo-generators are similar to those for the power units we produce for power plants. 

&#160; 

EPC of Power Plants. We engineer, procure and construct, as an EPC contractor, geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered-energy based power units described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe we have an advantage in that we are using our own manufactured equipment and thus have better quality and better control over the timing and delivery of required equipment and its related costs. The consideration for such services is usually paid in installments, in accordance with milestones set in the EPC contract and related documents. We usually provide performance guarantees or letters of credit securing our obligations under the contract. Upon delivery of the plant to its owner, such guarantees are replaced with a warranty guarantee, usually for a period ranging from 12 months to 36 months. The EPC contract usually places a cap on our liabilities for failure to meet our obligations thereunder. 

&#160; 

In connection with the sale of our power units for geothermal power plants, power units for recovered energy-based power generation, remote power units and other generators, we enter, from time to time, into sales agreements with sales representatives for the marketing and sale of such products pursuant to which we are obligated to pay commissions to such representatives upon the sale of our products in the relevant territory covered by such agreements by such representatives or, in some cases, by other representatives in such territory. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations and products are certified ISO 9001, ISO 14001, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and T&#220;V, and we are an approved supplier to many electric utilities around the world. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

We have a product backlog of approximately $256.3 million as of February 23, 2016, which includes revenues for the period between January 1, 2016 and February 23, 2016, compared to $325.8 million as of February 26, 2015, which included revenues for the period between January 1, 2015 and February 26, 2015.

Competition 

&#160; 

In our Electricity segment, we face competition from geothermal power plant owners and developers as well as other renewable energy providers. 

&#160; 

In our Product segment, we face competition from power plant equipment manufacturers or system integrators and from engineering or projects management companies. 

&#160; 

As we implement our new strategic plan, we will face competition from a number of sources, many of which may have resources, industry experience, market acceptance or other advantages we do not have. For example, expanding into new technologies, such as energy storage, or markets, such as C&#38;I will involve competition both from companies that already have established businesses in those technologies and markets, other companies seeking to acquire established businesses and other new market entrants like us. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Electricity Segment 

&#160; 

Competition in the Electricity segment is particularly marked in the very early stage of either obtaining the rights to the resource for the development of future projects or acquiring a site already in a more advanced stage of development. Once we or other developers obtained such rights or own a power plant, competition is limited. From time to time and in different jurisdictions competing geothermal developers become our customers in the Product segment. 

&#160; 

The main companies competing with us in the geothermal sector in the U.S. are CalEnergy, Calpine Corporation, Terra-Gen Power LLC, Enel Green Power S.p.A and other smaller-sized pure play developers. Outside the U.S., in many cases our competitors are companies that are gaining experience developing geothermal projects in their own countries such as Mighty River Power (MRP) from New Zealand and Origin Energy from Australia. Some of our competitors are now seeking to take the local experience they have gained and develop geothermal projects in other countries. These competitors include Energy Development Corporation (EDC) from the Philippines, Contact Energy Limited from New Zealand, Tata Group from India and Enel Green Power from Italy. Additionally, we see competition from small country-specific companies. While the geothermal industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, national electric utilities or state-owned oil companies might also enter the market. 

&#160; 

In obtaining new PPAs, we also face competition from companies engaged in the power generation business from other renewable energy sources, such as wind power, biomass, solar power and hydro-electric power. In the last few years, competition from the wind and solar power generation industries has increased significantly. 

&#160; 

As a geothermal company, we are focused on niche markets where our site-specific and base load advantages can allow us to develop competitive projects. 

&#160; 

&#160; Product Segment 

&#160; 

Our competitors among power plant equipment suppliers are divided into: high enthalpy and low enthalpy competitors. Our main high enthalpy competitors are industrial steam turbine manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. and Toshiba of Japan, GE/Nuovo Pignone brand and Ansaldo Energia of Italy. As noted above, we recently signed a strategic collaboration agreement with an affiliate of one of these competitors, Toshiba Corporation. 

&#160; 

Our low enthalpy competitors are binary systems manufacturers using the Organic Rankine Cycle such as Fuji Electric Co., Ltd of Japan, Atlas Copco Company, Exergy of Italy, and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (which acquired Turboden). While we believe that we have a distinct competitive advantage based on our accumulated experience and current worldwide share of installed binary generation capacity (which is approximately 90%), an increase in competition, which we are currently experiencing, has started to impact our ability to secure new purchase orders from potential customers. The increased competition may also lead to a reduction in the prices that we are able to charge for our binary equipment, which in turn may impact our profitability. 

&#160; 

In the REG business, our competitors are other Organic Rankine Cycle manufacturers (such as GE and Mitsubishi/Turboden), manufactures that use Kalina technology (such as Geothermal Energy Research &#38; Development Co., Ltd in Japan), as well as other manufacturers of conventional steam turbines. 

&#160; 

In the remote power unit business, we face competition from Global Thermoelectric, as well as from manufacturers of diesel generator sets and small wind and solar installations with batteries. 

&#160; 

Currently, none of our competitors compete with us in both the Electricity and the Product segments. 

&#160; 

In the case of proposed EPC projects we also compete with other service suppliers, such as project/engineering companies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

The credit ratings of any power purchaser may change from time to time. There is no publicly available information with respect to the credit rating or stability of the power purchasers under the PPAs for our foreign power plants. 

&#160; 

Our revenues from the Product segment are derived from contractors or owners or operators of power plants, process companies, and pipelines. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials, Suppliers and Subcontractors 

&#160; 

In connection with our manufacturing activities, we use raw materials such as steel and aluminum. We do not rely on any one supplier for the raw materials used in our manufacturing activities, as all of these raw materials are readily available from various suppliers. 

&#160; 

We use subcontractors for some of the manufacturing of our products components and for construction activities of our power plants, which allows us to expand our construction and development capacity on an as-needed basis. We are not dependent on any one subcontractor and expect to be able to replace any subcontractor, or assume such manufacturing and construction activities of our projects ourselves, without adverse effect to our operations. 

&#160; 

Employees&#160; 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 1,060 employees, of which 448 were located in the U.S., 499 were located in Israel and 113 were located in other countries. We expect that future growth in the number of our employees will be mainly attributable to the purchase and/or development of new power plants. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, none of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced any labor dispute, strike or work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We believe our future success will depend on our continuing ability to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., we currently do not have employees represented by unions recognized by the company under collective bargaining agreements. However, a union has filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in an attempt to organize our employees at our Puna complex in Hawaii. The NLRB ruled that a certification of representative should be issued. The Company appealed the NLRB decision and the matter was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California before being remanded back to the NLRB. As of the date of this report, the NLRB has put on hold its request for a hearing to bring unfair labor practice allegations before an administrative law judge in view of ongoing settlement discussions. 

&#160; 

We have no collective bargaining agreements with respect to our Israeli employees. However, by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement between the Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (which includes the Industrialists Association) may apply to some of our Israeli non-managerial, finance and administrative, and sales and marketing personnel. This collective bargaining agreement principally concerns cost of living pay increases, length of the workday, minimum wages and insurance for work-related accidents, annual and other vacation, sick pay, and determination of severance pay, pension contributions, and other conditions of employment. We currently provide such employees with benefits and working conditions which are at least as favorable as the conditions specified in the collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain business interruption insurance, casualty insurance, including flood, volcanic eruption and earthquake coverage, and primary and excess liability insurance, control of wells, as well as customary worker&#8217;s compensation and automobile, marine transportation insurance and such other commercial insurance, if any, as is generally carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas or as may be required by any of our PPAs, or any lease, financing arrangement, or other contract. To the extent any such casualty insurance covers both us and/or our power plants, and any other person and/or plants, we generally have specifically designated as applicable solely to us and our power plants &#8220;all risk&#8221; property insurance coverage in an amount based upon the estimated full replacement value of our power plants (provided that earthquake, volcanic eruption and flood coverage may be subject to annual aggregate limits depending on the type and location of the power plant) and business interruption insurance in an amount that also varies from power plant to power plant. 

&#160; 

We generally purchase insurance policies to cover our exposure to certain political risks involved in operating in developing countries. Political risk insurance policies are generally issued by entities which specialize in such policies, such as MIGA (a member of the World Bank Group), or by private sector providers, such as Lloyd Syndicates, Zurich Emerging Markets and other such companies. To date, all of our political risk insurance contracts are with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and with Zurich Emerging Markets. Currently we hold such insurance for our Zunil and Olkaria operating power plants, and for the Sarulla project, which is under construction. Such insurance policies generally cover, subject to the limitations and restrictions contained therein, approximately 90% of our losses derived from a specified governmental act, such as confiscation, expropriation, riots, and the inability to convert local currency into hard currency and, in certain cases, the breach of agreements with governmental entities.

Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in the United States 

&#160; 

The following is a summary overview of the electric utility industry and applicable federal and state regulations, and should not be considered a full statement of the law or all issues pertaining thereto. 

&#160; 

PURPA 

&#160; 

PURPA provides the owners of power plants certain benefits described below, if a power plant is a &#8220;Qualifying Facility&#8221;. A small power production facility is a Qualifying Facility if: (i) the facility does not exceed 80 MW; (ii) the primary energy source of the facility is biomass, waste, renewable resources, or any combination thereof, and at least 75% of the total energy input of the facility is from these sources, and fossil fuel input is limited to specified uses; and (iii) the facility , if larger than one megawatt, has filed with FERC a notice of self-certification of qualifying status, or has filed with FERC an application for FERC certification of qualifying status, that has been granted. The 80 MW size limitation, however, does not apply to a facility if (i) it produces electric energy solely by the use, as a primary energy input, of solar, wind, waste or geothermal resources; and (ii) an application for certification or a notice of self-certification of qualifying status of the facility was submitted to FERC prior to December 21, 1994, and construction of the facility commenced prior to December 31, 1999. 

&#160; 

FERC&#39;s regulations under PURPA exempt owners of small power production Qualifying Facilities that use geothermal resources as their primary source and other Qualifying Facilities that are 30 MW or under in size from regulation under the PUHCA 2005, from many provisions of the FPA and from state laws relating to the financial, organization and rate regulation of electric utilities. 

&#160; 

With respect to the FPA, FERC&#39;s regulations under PURPA do not exempt from the rate provisions of the FPA sales of energy or capacity from Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size that are made (a) pursuant to a contract executed after March 17, 2006 that is not a contract made pursuant to a state regulatory authority&#8217;s implementation of PURPA or (b) not pursuant to another provision of a state regulatory authority&#8217;s implementation of PURPA. The practical effect of these regulations is to require owners of Qualifying Facilities that are larger than 20 MW in size to obtain market-based rate authority from FERC if they seek to sell energy or capacity other than pursuant to a contract executed before March 17, 2006 pursuant to a state regulatory authority&#8217;s implementation of PURPA or pursuant to a provision of a state regulatory authority&#8217;s implementation of PURPA. Until that contract expires, is terminated or is materially modified, a Qualifying Facility, under a PURPA contract executed prior to March 17, 2006, will not be required to file for market based rates. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, PURPA and FERC&#8217;s regulations under PURPA require that electric utilities offer to purchase electricity generated by Qualifying Facilities at a rate based on the purchasing utility&#8217;s incremental cost of purchasing or producing energy (also known as &#8220;avoided cost&#8221;). However, FERC&#39;s regulations under PURPA also allow FERC, upon request of a utility, to terminate a utility&#8217;s obligation to purchase energy from Qualifying Facilities upon a finding that Qualifying Facilities have nondiscriminatory access to either: (i) independently administered, auction-based day ahead, and real time markets for energy and wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity; (ii) transmission and interconnection services provided by a FERC-approved regional transmission entity and administered under an open-access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers, and competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity and energy, including long and short term sales; or (iii) wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and energy that are at a minimum of comparable competitive quality as markets described in (i) and (ii) above. FERC regulations protect a Qualifying Facility&#8217;s rights under any contract or obligation involving purchases or sales that are entered into before FERC has determined that the contracting utility is entitled to relief from the mandatory purchase obligation. FERC has granted the request of California investor-owned utilities for a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation for Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size. 

&#160; 

We expect that our power plants in the U.S will continue to meet all of the criteria required for Qualifying Facilities under PURPA. However, since the Heber power plants have PPAs with Southern California Edison that require Qualifying Facility status to be maintained, maintaining Qualifying Facility status remains a key obligation. If any of the Heber power plants loses its Qualifying Facility status our operations could be adversely affected. Loss of Qualifying Facility status would eliminate the Heber power plants&#8217; exemption from the FPA and thus, among other things, the rates charged by the Heber power plants in the PPAs with Southern California Edison and SCPPA would become subject to FERC regulation. Further, it is possible that the utilities that purchase power from the power plants could successfully obtain a waiver of the mandatory-purchase obligation in their service territories. For example, the three California investor-owned utilities have received such a waiver from FERC for projects larger than 20 MW. If this occurs, the power plants&#8217; existing PPAs will not be affected, but the utilities will not be obligated under PURPA to renew these PPAs or execute new PPAs upon the existing PPAs&#8217; expiration. 

&#160; 

PUHCA 

&#160; 

Under PUHCA 2005, the books and records of a utility holding company, its affiliates, associate companies, and subsidiaries are subject to FERC and state commission review with respect to transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of either FERC or the state commission or costs incurred by a jurisdictional utility in the same holding company system. However, if a company is a utility holding company solely with respect to Qualifying Facilities, exempt wholesale generators, or foreign utility companies, it will not be subject to review of books and records by FERC under PUHCA 2005. Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity are not subject to state commissions&#8217; rate regulations and, therefore, in all likelihood would not be subject to any review of their books and records by state commissions pursuant to PUHCA 2005 as long as the Qualifying Facility is not part of a holding company system that includes a utility subject to regulation in that state. 

&#160; 

FPA 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the FPA, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for most wholesale sales of electricity and transmission in interstate commerce. These rates may be based on a cost of service approach or may be determined on a market basis through competitive bidding or negotiation. FERC&#39;s regulations under PURPA exempt owners of small power production Qualifying Facilities that use geothermal resources as their primary source and other Qualifying Facilities that are 30 MW or under in size from many provisions of the FPA. If any of the power plants were to lose its Qualifying Facility status, such power plant could become subject to the full scope of the FPA and applicable state regulations. The application of the FPA and other applicable state regulations to the power plants could require our power plants to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory regime that may be costly and greatly reduce our operational flexibility. Even if a power plant does not lose Qualifying Facility status, if a PPA with a power plant expires, is terminated or is materially modified, the owner of a Qualifying Facility power plant in excess of 20 MW will become subject to rate regulation under the Federal Power Act. 

&#160; 

If a power plant in the U.S. were to become subject to FERC&#8217;s ratemaking jurisdiction under the FPA as a result of loss of Qualifying Facility status and the PPA remains in effect, FERC may determine that the rates currently set forth in the PPA are not just and reasonable and may set rates that are lower than the rates currently charged. In addition, FERC may require that the power plant refund a portion of amounts previously paid by the relevant power purchaser to such power plant. Such events would likely result in a decrease in our future revenues or in an obligation to disgorge revenues previously earned by from the power plant, either of which would have an adverse effect on our revenues. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Moreover, the loss of the Qualifying Facility status of any of our power plants selling energy to Southern California Edison could also permit Southern California Edison, pursuant to the terms of its PPA, to cease taking and paying for electricity from the relevant power plant and to seek refunds for past amounts paid. In addition, the loss of any such status would result in the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture for the OFC Senior Secured Notes and the OrCal Senior Secured Notes and hence would give the indenture trustee the right to exercise remedies pursuant to the indenture and the other financing documents. 

&#160; 

&#160; State Regulation 

&#160; 

Our power plants in California and Nevada, by virtue of being Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity, are not subject to rate, financial and organizational regulations applicable to electric utilities in those states. The power plants each sell or will sell their electrical output under PPAs to electric utilities (Sierra Pacific Power Company, Nevada Power Company, Southern California Edison or SCPPA). All of the utilities except SCPPA are regulated by their respective state public utilities commissions. Sierra Pacific Power Company and Nevada Power Company, which merged and are doing business as NV Energy, are regulated by the PUCN. Southern California Edison is regulated by the CPUC. 

&#160; 

Under Hawaii law, non-fossil generators are not subject to regulation as public utilities. Hawaii law provides that a geothermal power producer is to negotiate the rate for its output with the public utility purchaser. If such rate cannot be determined by mutual accord, the PUCH will set a just and reasonable rate. If a non-fossil generator in Hawaii is a Qualifying Facility, federal law applies to such Qualifying Facility and the utility is required to purchase the energy and capacity at its avoided cost. The rates for our power plant in Hawaii are established under a long-term PPA with HELCO. 

&#160; 

Environmental Permits 

&#160; 

U.S. environmental permitting regimes with respect to geothermal projects center upon several general areas of focus. The first involves land use approvals. These may take the form of Special Use Permits or Conditional Use Permits from local planning authorities or a series of development and utilization plan approvals and right of way approvals where the geothermal facility is entirely or partly on BLM or U.S. Forest Service lands. Certain federal approvals require a review of environmental impacts in conformance with the federal National Environmental Policy Act. In California, some local permit approvals require a similar review of environmental impacts under a state statute known as the California Environmental Quality Act. These federal and local land use approvals typically impose conditions and restrictions on the construction, scope and operation of geothermal projects. 

&#160; 

The second category of permitting focuses on the installation and use of the geothermal wells themselves. Geothermal projects typically have three types of wells: (i) exploration wells designed to define and verify the geothermal resource, (ii) production wells to extract the hot geothermal liquids (also known as brine) for the power plant, and (iii) injection wells to inject the brine back into the subsurface resource. For example, in Nevada and on BLM lands, the well permits take the form of geothermal drilling permits for well installation. Approvals are also required to modify wells, including for use as production or injection wells. For all wells drilled in Nevada, a geothermal drilling permit must be obtained from the Nevada Division of Minerals. Those wells in Nevada to be used for injection will also require Underground Injection Control permits from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. Geothermal wells on private lands in California require drilling permits from the California Department of Conservation&#8217;s DOGGR. The eventual designation of these installed wells as individual production or injection wells and the ultimate closure of any wells is also reviewed and approved by DOGGR pursuant to a DOGGR-approved Geothermal Injection Program. 

&#160; 

A third category of permits involves the regulation of potential air emissions associated with the construction and operation of wells and power plants and surface water discharges associated with construction and operations activities. Generally, each well and plant requires a preconstruction air permit and storm water discharge permit before earthwork can commence. In addition, in some jurisdictions the wells that are to be used for production require and those used for injection may require air emissions permits to operate. Internal combustion engines and other air pollutant emissions sources at the projects may also require air emissions permits. For our projects, these permits are typically issued at the state or county level. Permits are also required to manage storm water during project construction and to manage drilling muds from well construction, as well as to manage certain discharges to surface impoundments, if any. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A fourth category of permits, that are required in both California and Nevada, includes ministerial permits such as building permits, hazardous materials storage and management permits, and pressure vessel operating permits. We are also required to obtain water rights permits in Nevada. In addition to permits, there are various regulatory plans and programs that are required, including risk management plans (federal and state programs) and hazardous materials management plans (in California). 

&#160; 

In some cases our projects may also require permits, issued by the applicable federal agencies or authorized state agencies, regarding threatened or endangered species, permits to impact wetlands or other waters and notices of construction of structures which may have an impact on airspace. Environmental laws and regulations may change in the future, which may lead to increases in the time to receive such permits and associated costs of compliance. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, all of the material environmental permits and approvals currently required for our operating power plants have been obtained. We are currently experiencing regulatory delays in obtaining various environmental permits and approvals required for projects in development and construction. These delays may lead to increases in the time and cost to complete these projects. Our operations are designed and conducted to comply with applicable environmental permit and approval requirements. Non-compliance with any such requirements could result in fines and penalties, and could also affect our ability to operate the affected project. 

&#160; 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 

&#160; 

Our facilities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations relating to development, construction and operation. In the U.S, these may include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Our geothermal operations involve significant quantities of brine (substantially, all of which we reinject into the subsurface) and scale, both of which can contain materials (such as arsenic, antimony, lead, and naturally occurring radioactive materials) in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits used to define hazardous waste. We also use various substances, including isopentane and industrial lubricants that could become potential contaminants and are generally flammable. Hazardous materials are also used in our equipment manufacturing operations in Israel. As a result, our projects are subject to domestic and foreign federal, state and local statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the use, storage, fugitive emissions, and disposal of hazardous substances. The cost of investigation and removal or remediation activities associated with a spill or release of such materials could be significant. 

&#160; 

Although we are not aware of any mismanagement of these materials, including any mismanagement prior to the acquisition of some of our power plants, that has materially impaired any of the power plant sites, any disposal or release of these materials onto the power plant sites, other than by means of permitted injection wells, could lead to contamination of the environment and result in material cleanup requirements or other responsive obligations under applicable environmental laws. We believe that at one time there may have been a gas station located on the Mammoth complex site, but because of significant surface disturbance and construction since that time further physical evaluation of the environmental condition of the former gas station site has been impractical. We believe that, given the subsequent surface disturbance and construction activity in the vicinity of the suspected location of the service station, it is likely that environmental contamination, if any, associated with the former facilities and any associated underground storage tanks would have already been encountered if they still existed. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in our Foreign Countries of Operation 

&#160; 

The following is a summary overview of certain aspects of the electric industry in the foreign countries in which we have an operating geothermal power plant. As such, it should not be considered a full statement of the laws in such countries or all of the issues pertaining thereto. 

&#160; 

Guatemala . The General Electricity Law of 1996, Decree 93-96, created a wholesale electricity market in Guatemala and established a new regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The law created a new regulatory commission, the CNEE, and a new wholesale power market administrator, the AMM, for the regulation and administration of the sector. The AMM is a private not-for-profit entity. The CNEE functions as an independent agency under the Ministry of Energy and Mines and is in charge of regulating, supervising, and controlling compliance with the electricity law, overseeing the market and setting rates for transmission services, and distribution to medium and small customers. All distribution companies must supply electricity to such customers pursuant to long-term contracts with electricity generators. Large customers can contract directly with the distribution companies, electricity generators or power marketers, or buy energy in the spot market. Guatemala has approved a Law of Incentives for the Development of Renewable Energy Power plants, Decree 52-2003, in order to promote the development of renewable energy power plants in Guatemala. This law provides certain benefits to companies utilizing renewable energy, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and VAT on imports and customs duties. On September 16, 2008, CNEE issued a resolution which approved the Technical Norms for the Connection, Operation, Control and Commercialization of the Renewable Distributed Generation and Self-producers Users with Exceeding Amounts of Energy. This Technical Norm was created to regulate all aspects of generation, connection, operation, control and commercialization of electric energy produced with renewable sources to promote and facilitate the installation of new generation plants, and to promote the connection of existing generation plants which have exceeding amounts of electric energy for commercialization. It is applicable to projects with a capacity of up to 5 MW. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Kenya . The electric power sector in Kenya is regulated by the Kenyan Energy Act. Among other things, the Kenyan Energy Act provides for the licensing of electricity power producers and public electricity suppliers or distributors. KPLC is the only licensed public electricity supplier and has a monopoly in the distribution of electricity in the country. The Kenyan Energy Act permits IPPs to install power generators and sell electricity to KPLC, which is owned by various private and government entities, and which currently purchases energy and capacity from other IPPs in addition to our Olkaria III complex. The electricity sector is regulated by the ERC which was created under the Kenyan Energy Act. KPLC&#8217;s retail electricity rates are subject to approval by the ERC. The ERC has an expanded mandate to regulate not just the electric power sector but the entire energy sector in Kenya. Transmission of electricity is now undertaken by KETRACO while another company, GDC, is responsible for geothermal assessment, drilling of wells and sale of steam for electricity operations to IPPs and KenGen. Both KETRACO and GDC are wholly owned by the government of Kenya. Under the new national constitution enacted in August 2010, formulation of energy policy (including electricity) and energy regulation are functions of the national government. However, the constitution lists the planning and development of electricity and energy regulation as a function of the county governments (i.e. the regional or local level where an individual power plant is or is intended to be located).
