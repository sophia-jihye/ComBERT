&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a mining company that was formed in Nevada on July 2, 2007. As a mining company, we are engaged in the production of previous metals. Our activities are not limited to production and they also include acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties, primarily for gold, from owned mining properties. Inception Mining has acquired two projects, as described below. Our target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration. We have generated revenue from mining operations. 

&#160; 

On October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger with Clavo Rico Ltd. (&#8220;Clavo Rico&#8221;). Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining concession through its subsidiaries Compa&#241;&#237;a Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compa&#241;&#237;a Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V. and holds other mining concessions. Its workings include several historical underground mining operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation. 

&#160; 

On January 11, 2016, the Company authorized a 5.5:1 reverse stock split on its shares of common stock with a record date of January 11, 2016. The reverse split has not yet been approved and announced by FINRA. 

&#160; 

On February 25, 2013, the Company acquired certain real property and the associated exploration permits and mineral rights commonly known as the U.P. and Burlington Gold Mine (&#8220;UP &#38; Burlington&#8221;) pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement entered between the Company, its majority shareholder (the &#8220;Majority Shareholder&#8221;), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inception Development Inc. (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;) on one hand, and Inception Resources on the other hand, dated February 25, 2013 (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;). We are presently in the exploration stage at UP &#38; Burlington. UP &#38; Burlington contains two Federal patented mining claims which Inception Resources acquired for the purpose of the exploration and potential development of gold on the 40 acres which comprises UP &#38; Burlington. 

&#160; 

As part of our initial Plan of Operations for UP &#38; Burlington, we have two-phases. During Phase I, we have obtained the necessary permitting to make an additional access road and surface improvements. We have implemented a bulk sample project on the surface of a 2,500 foot per day-lighted vein to depths of 40-60 feet. We plan to implement a Confirmatory Core Drilling Program that will be (NI43-101) compliant, with Vein Definition and Ore Valuation. In Phase II, we plan to contract an underground mining and operations plan, expand portal development leveraging existing underground access and implement underground mining to a depth based on optimizing costs versus processed ore value. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing either Phase I or Phase II. 

&#160; 

The Company and its independent consultants have developed a detailed exploration-drilling program to confirm and expand mineralized zones in these mines and collect additional environmental and technical data. The first phase of confirmation and expansion will begin in 2015 and the Company intends to continue evaluation, metallurgical testing, engineering and environmental programs and studies during 2016 and soon thereafter update the historic feasibility study and environmental permit applications. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We also plan to review opportunities and acquire additional mineral properties with current or historic precious and base metal mineralization with meaningful exploration potential. 

&#160; 

Competition and Mineral Prices 

&#160; 

We compete with many companies in the mining business, including larger, more established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease or acquisition in the United States and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. Because we compete with individuals and companies that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring desirable mineral properties. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition are unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the mining industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital needed to fund the acquisition and operation of such properties. Competition may result in our company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees, to obtain equipment and personnel to assist in our exploration activities or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business. The mineral exploration industry is highly fragmented, and we are a very small participant in this sector. Many of our competitors explore for a variety of minerals and control many different properties around the world. Many of them have been in business longer than we have and have established strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial resources than we do. 

&#160; 

There is significant competition for properties suitable for gold exploration. As a result, we may be unable to continue to acquire interests in attractive properties on terms that we consider acceptable. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as drill rigs, bulldozers and excavators that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them. 

&#160; 

Market for Gold 

&#160; 

In the event that gold is produced from our property, we believe that wholesale purchasers for the gold would be readily available, as many purchasers of precious metals exist in the United States and abroad. Among the largest are Handy &#38; Harman, Engelhard Industries and Johnson Matthey, Ltd. Historically, these markets are liquid and volatile. Wholesale purchase prices for precious metals can be affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; fluctuation in the supply of, demand, and market price for gold; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; mining activities of our competitors; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; interest rates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; currency exchange rates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; inflation or deflation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and other currencies; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral-producing countries. &#160; 

If we find gold that is deemed of economic grade and in sufficient quantities to justify removal, we may seek additional capital through equity or debt financing to build a mine and processing facility, or enter into joint venture or other arrangements with large and more experienced companies better able to fund ongoing exploration and development work, or find some other entity to mine our property on our behalf, or sell or lease our rights to mine the gold. Upon mining, the ore would be processed through a series of steps that produces a rough concentrate. This rough concentrate is then sold to refiners and smelters for the value of the minerals that it contains, less the cost of further concentrating, refining and smelting. Refiners and smelters then sell the gold on the open market through brokers who work for wholesalers including the major wholesalers listed above. We have not found any gold as of today, and there is no assurance that we will find any gold in the future. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Mining Operations 

&#160; 

UP and BURLINGTON (Lemhi County, Idaho) 

&#160; 

Mine operation is governed by both federal and state law. We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally. Federal laws, such as those governing the purchase, transport or storage of explosives, and those governing mine safety and health, also apply. The Company plans to obtain a Lemhi County Conditional Use Permit, an Idaho Department of Lands Surface Reclamation Bond and permitting for the U.S. Forest Service Access Road. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

When this mine comes into production we will also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, a Division of the United States Department of Labor. 

&#160; 

CLAVO RICO (Honduras, Central America) 

&#160; 

The mining operations in Honduras are governed by the national entities Honduran Institute of Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA). The Clavo Rico mine has operated under a grandfathered concession granted many years ago and has now complied with all regulatory requirements of the above agencies and the recently adopted Honduran Mining laws (The General Mining Law was approved by Legislative Decree No. 238-2012, dated January 23, 2013), including employee health and safety regulations, Environmental requirements, water discharge requirements, and potential reclamation requirements. As the above ministries have only limited operational experience and the new mining law has only recently been adopted, the interpretation, adoption and enforcement of many regulations are evolving. Other local ordinances (municipality of El Corpus) minor and most regulatory efforts are as a result of interaction between the mine and the local populace, (examples include use of the mine haul road for local traffic, restricting mine operations to daylight hours for noise considerations, watering for dust control, etc.) where no regulation or law exists, we have attempted to duplicate best practices as required in other business climates. 

&#160; 

These laws and regulations are continually changing and, as a general matter, are becoming more restrictive. The Company&#8217;s policy is to conduct our business in a manner that safeguards public health and mitigates the environmental effects of our business activities. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures. 

&#160; 

Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

Mining activities at the Company&#8217;s properties are also subject to various environmental laws, both federal and state, including but not limited to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, CERCLA (as defined below), the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and certain Idaho state laws governing the discharge of pollutants and the use and discharge of water. Various permits from federal and state agencies are required under many of these laws. Local laws and ordinances may also apply to such activities as construction of facilities, land use, waste disposal, road use and noise levels. 

&#160; 

These laws and regulations are continually changing and, as a general matter, are becoming more restrictive. The Company&#8217;s policy is to conduct our business in a manner that safeguards public health and mitigates the environmental effects of our business activities. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures. 

&#160; 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), imposes strict, joint, and several liabilities on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances. Liable parties include, among others, the current owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed or released into the environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time of such disposal or release. This liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damages to natural resources. Our properties, because of past mining activities, could give rise to potential liability under CERCLA. 

&#160; 

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and related state laws, mining companies may incur costs for generating, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous or solid wastes associated with certain mining-related activities. RCRA costs may also include corrective action or cleanup costs. 

&#160; 

Mining operations may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants, from stationary equipment, such as crushers and storage facilities, and from mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment. All of these sources are subject to review, monitoring, permitting, and/or control requirements under the federal Clean Air Act and related state air quality laws. Air quality permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the permitting conditions. 

&#160; 

Under the federal Clean Water Act and the delegated Colorado water-quality program, point-source discharges into waters of the State are regulated by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. Storm water discharges also are regulated and permitted under that statute. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of dredge and fill material into Waters of the United States, including wetlands. All of those programs may impose permitting and other requirements on our operations. 

&#160; 

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires an assessment of the environmental impacts of major federal actions. The federal action requirement must be satisfied if the project involves federal land or if the federal government provides financing or permitting approvals. NEPA does not establish any substantive standards, but requires the analysis of any potential impacts. The scope of the assessment process depends on the size of the project. An Environmental Assessment (EA) may be adequate for smaller projects. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which is much more detailed and broader in scope than an EA, is required for larger projects. NEPA compliance requirements for any of our proposed projects could result in additional costs or delays. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of Interior. The purpose of the ESA is to conserve and recover listed endangered and threatened species and their habitat. Under the ESA, endangered means that a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened under such statute means that a species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. Under the ESA, it is unlawful to take a listed species, which can include harassing or harming members of such species or significantly modifying their habitat. Future identification of endangered species or habitat in our project areas may delay or adversely affect our operations. 

&#160; 

U.S. federal and state reclamation requirements often mandate concurrent reclamation and require permitting in addition to the posting of reclamation bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurance sufficient to guarantee the cost of reclamation. If reclamation obligations are not met, the designated agency could draw on these bonds or letters of credit to fund expenditures for reclamation requirements. Reclamation requirements generally include stabilizing, contouring and re-vegetating disturbed lands, controlling drainage from portals and waste rock dumps, removing roads and structures, neutralizing or removing process solutions, monitoring groundwater at the mining site, and maintaining visual aesthetics. 

&#160; 

Capital Equipment and Research &#38; Development Expenditures 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not incur any expense related to research and development. Additionally, we are not currently conducting any research and development activities other than those relating to the possible acquisition of new gold and/or silver properties or projects of which there is no guarantee. As we proceed with our exploration programs, we may need to engage additional contractors and consider the possibility of adding additional permanent employees, as well as the possible purchase or lease of equipment. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of the date of this filing, we currently employ ninety-five (95) full-time employees and generally around twenty-one (21) temporary employees in the United States and Honduras. We have contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including investor relations, exploration, development, permitting, and other administrative functions, and may staff further with employees as we expand activities and bring new projects on line. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts 

&#160; 

We do not currently own any patents or trademarks. Also, we are not a party to any license or franchise agreements, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts arising from any patents or trademarks. 

&#160;

The Company makes available its filings to investors, free of charge, on this website. 

&#160; 

RISK FACTORS 

&#160; 

An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, along with all of the other information included in this report, before deciding to buy our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring, then our business may suffer. 

&#160; 

Risks Relating to Our Company 

&#160; 

We have incurred losses since our inception in 2007 and may never be profitable, which raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

Since our inception in 2007, we have had nominal operations and incurred operating losses. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit since inception was $13,335,797. We have substantial current obligations and at December 31, 2015, we had $18,039,976 of current liabilities compared to only $1,140,777 of current assets. Since inception, we have been able to raise only minimal additional capital, and we have minimal cash on hand. Accordingly, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources or current assets to pay its current obligations, and we have been meeting many of our obligations through the issuance of our common stock to our employees, consultants and advisors as payment for the goods and services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our management continues to search for additional financing; however, considering the difficult U.S. and global economic conditions along with the substantial turmoil in the capital and credit markets, there is a significant possibility that we will be unable to obtain financing to continue our operations. 

&#160; 

As we are in the beginning stages of our exploration activities on UP &#38; Burlington, and such property has not generated revenue in the recent past, we expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future, and such losses may continue to be significant. To become profitable, we must be successful in raising capital to continue with our mining efforts, exploration activities, meet the work commitment requirements on UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico, discover economically feasible mineralization deposits and establish reserves, successfully develop the properties and finally realize adequate prices on our minerals in the marketplace. It could be years before we receive any revenues from gold production, if ever. Thus, we may never be profitable. 

&#160; 

These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as described in an explanatory paragraph to our independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s report on our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, investors will likely lose all of their investment in our company. 

&#160; 

We have a limited operating history. 

&#160; 

As an early stage company that has recently made acquisitions, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications, and delays inherent in a new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. Our business is dependent upon the implementation of our business plan. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s recent merger with the operating foreign entity was based on a review of all historical data and potential revenue streams and resources as could be ascertained from the submission of documents and a thorough review of all data made available. We believe the materials to be accurate and have attempted to discount the valuations due to perceived risks of foreign operations and the tasks of incorporating a non-public entity into inception. 

&#160; 

The feasibility of mineral extraction from UP &#38; Burlington has not yet been established, as we have not completed exploration or other work necessary to determine if it is commercially feasible to develop the properties. 

&#160; 

UP &#38; Burlington does not have any proven or probable reserves. A &#8220;reserve,&#8221; as defined by the SEC, is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. A reserve requires a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable certainty that the deposit can be economically extracted and produced. We have not yet completed our feasibility study with regard to UP &#38; Burlington. As a result, we currently have no reserves and there are no assurances that we will be able to prove that there are reserves on UP &#38; Burlington. 

&#160; 

Exploring for gold is an inherently speculative business. 

&#160; 

Natural resource exploration, and exploring for gold in particular, is a business that by its nature is very speculative. There is a strong possibility that we will not discover gold or any other resources that can be mined or extracted at a profit. Even if we do discover gold or other deposits, the deposit may not be of the quality or size necessary for us to make a profit after extracting it. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected geological formations, geological formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent development of gold deposits. 

&#160; 

We will require significant additional capital to continue our exploration activities, and, if warranted, to develop mining operations. 

&#160; 

We will be required to raise significantly more capital in order to develop UP &#38; Burlington for mining production, assuming economically viable reserves exist. There is no assurance that our investments in UP &#38; Burlington will be financially productive. We will also be required to raise significantly more capital in order to fund our Clavo Rico operations. Our ability to obtain necessary funding depends upon a number of factors, including the price of gold, base metals, and other minerals we are able to mine, the status of the national and worldwide economy, and the availability of funds in the capital markets. If we are unable to obtain the required financing in the near future for these or other purposes, our exploration activities would be delayed or indefinitely postponed, we would likely may lose our lease and options to acquire an ownership interest in UP &#38; Burlington and be unable to fund our operations at the Clavo Rico mine in Honduras. This would likely lead to failure of our Company. Even if financing is available, it may be on terms that are not favorable to us, in which case, our ability to become profitable or to continue operating would be adversely affected. If we are unable to raise funds, the market value of our securities will likely decline, and our investors may lose some or all of their investment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The global financial conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. 

&#160; 

The continued pressure on commodities markets and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business and financial position. The recent high costs of consumables may negatively impact costs of our operations. In addition, current financial market conditions may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets. As discussed further below, the prices of the metals that we may produce are affected by a number of factors, and it is unknown how these factors will be impacted by a continuation of the financial crisis. 

&#160; 

Fluctuating gold and mineral prices could negatively impact our business plan. 

&#160; 

The potential for profitability of our gold and mineral mining operations and the value of any mining properties we may acquire will be directly related to the market price of gold and minerals that we mine. Historically, gold and other mineral prices have widely fluctuated, and are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including inflation, currency fluctuations, regional and global demand, and political and economic conditions. Fluctuations in the price of gold and other minerals that we mine may have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock and a prolonged decline in these prices will have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to extensive environmental regulations which may make exploring for or mining prohibitively expensive, and which may change at any time. 

&#160; 

All of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which could make exploration expensive or prohibit it altogether. We may be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other related activities on our properties. We may have to pay to remedy environmental pollution, which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for exploration. This may adversely affect our financial position, which may cause you to lose your investment. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy. If a decision is made to mine our properties and we retain any operational responsibility for doing so, our potential exposure for remediation may be significant, and this may have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial position. We have not yet purchased insurance for potential environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste products from our exploration activities). However, if we mine one or more of our properties and retain operational responsibility for mining, then such insurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price. All of our exploration and, if warranted, development activities may be subject to regulation under one or more local, state and federal environmental impact analyses and public review processes. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business, which may require our business to be economically re-evaluated from time to time. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capability. Inasmuch as posting of bonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under all material operating permits, increases in bonding requirements could prevent operations even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws. 

&#160; 

We may be denied the government licenses and permits which we need to explore on our properties. In the event that we discover commercially exploitable deposits, we may be denied the additional government licenses and permits which we will need to mine our properties. 

&#160; 

Exploration activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies. For example, exploration drilling on unpatented mineral claims requires a permit to be obtained from the United States Bureau of Land Management, which may take several months or longer to grant the requested permit. Depending on the size, location and scope of the exploration program, additional permits may also be required before exploration activities can be undertaken. Prehistoric or Indian grave yards, threatened or endangered species, archeological sites or the possibility thereof, difficult access, excessive dust and important nearby water resources may all result in the need for additional permits before exploration activities can commence. As with all permitting processes, there is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive costs may be experienced in obtaining required permits. The needed permits may not be granted at all. Delays in or our inability to obtain necessary permits will result in unanticipated costs, which may result in serious adverse effects upon our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The values of our properties are subject to volatility in the price of gold and any other deposits we may seek or locate. 

&#160; 

Our ability to obtain additional and continuing funding, and our profitability in the event we ever commence mining operations or sell our rights to mine, will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold. Further, the gold deposits that are recovered from our Clavo Rico mine with also be subject to the volatility in the price of gold. Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors include the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions; interest rates; currency exchange rates; inflation or deflation; fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and other currencies; speculation; global and regional supply and demand, including investment, industrial and jewelry demand; and the political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral producing countries throughout the world, such as Russia and South Africa. The price of gold or other minerals have fluctuated widely in recent years, and a decline in the price of gold could cause a significant decrease in the value of our properties, limit our ability to raise money, and render continued exploration and development of our properties impracticable. If that happens, then we could lose our rights to our properties and be compelled to sell some or all of these rights. Additionally, the future development of our properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon the level of gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make the development of our properties economically viable. You may lose your investment if the price of gold decreases. The greater the decrease in the price of gold, the more likely it is that you will lose money. 

&#160; 

Our property titles may be challenged. We are not insured against any challenges, impairments or defects to our mineral claims or property titles. We have not fully verified title to our properties. 

&#160; 

Our future unpatented claims will be created and maintained in accordance with the federal General Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented claims are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under the General Mining Law. Defending any challenges to our future property titles may be costly, and may divert funds that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes. In addition, unpatented claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government, which, if successful, may prevent us from exploiting our discovery of commercially extractable gold. Challenges to our title may increase our costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions of our properties. We are not insured against challenges, impairments or defects to our property titles, nor do we intend to carry extensive title insurance in the future. Potential conflicts to our mineral claims are discussed in detail elsewhere herein. 

&#160; 

Honduran mining operations have increased exposure. 

&#160; 

Sustaining foreign mining operations, such as those in Honduras, comes with increased uncertainty, due to less stable governments, political interruptions, volatility in taxes and fees, implementation of new laws and regulations, and more. The effect of this exposure can lead to closure of operations, nationalization, and strikes, all of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Granting and maintaining concessions is highly subject to political whim and maintaining the concessions is subject to a number of factors and variables beyond the company&#8217;s control. We do not currently insure against these interruptions but have chosen to structure our operations to minimize exposure to capital assets by subcontracting major areas of work, and to otherwise keep our financial exposure limited even at the expense of operation costs and our bottom line. 

&#160; 

Foreign operations involve numerous risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates and other financial risks. 

&#160; 

Foreign operations involve numerous risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates and with increasing taxes and fees associated with importing of necessary goods, equipment and services not adequately found in country and with exporting of the finished gold dore&#769;. Recent enactment of the Honduran mining laws has helped stabilize the fees, but continual review by the various government operations, and central bank subject the historical operations to review and could impact our ability to export on a timely basis and/or face possible fines etc. associated with repatriation of past revenues, etc. 

&#160; 

Possible amendments to the General Mining Law could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business plan. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Congress has considered proposals to amend the General Mining Law of 1872 that would have, among other things, permanently banned the sale of public land for mining. The proposed amendment would have expanded the environmental regulations to which we might be subject and would have given Indian tribes the ability to hinder or prohibit mining operations near tribal lands. The proposed amendment would also have imposed a royalty of 8% of gross revenue on new mining operations located on federal public land, which might have applied to our future properties. The proposed amendment would have made it more expensive or perhaps too expensive to recover any otherwise commercially exploitable gold deposits which we might find on our future properties. While at this time the proposed amendment is no longer pending, this or similar changes to the law in the future could have a significant impact on our business model. 

&#160; 

Market forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other resources. 

&#160; 

Gold exploration, and resource exploration in general, demands contractors available for such work, and unforeseen shortages of supplies and/or equipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities. Current demand for exploration drilling services, equipment and supplies is robust and could result in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled times for our exploration program. Fuel prices are extremely volatile as well. We will attempt to locate suitable equipment, materials, manpower and fuel if sufficient funds are available. If we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs, we may have to suspend some or all of them until equipment, supplies, funds and/or skilled manpower become available. Any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration activities. 

&#160; 

Our exploration activities depend upon adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources, and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs. Unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Our exploration activities may be adversely affected by the local climates, which could prevent or impair us from exploring our properties year round. 

&#160; 

The local climate in our area of operations may impair or prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our properties year round. Because of its rural location and limited infrastructure in this area, our property is generally impassible for several days each year as a result of significant rain or snow events. Earthquakes, heavy rains, snowstorms, and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities, equipment or means of access to our properties, or may otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our properties. 

&#160; 

We do not currently carry any property or casualty insurance. 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including but not limited to, adverse environmental conditions, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, ground or slope failures, cave-ins, changes in the regulatory environment, and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods and earthquakes. Such occurrences could result in damage to our properties, equipment, infrastructure, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays, monetary losses and possible legal liability. You could lose all or part of your investment if any such catastrophic event occurs. We do not carry any property or casualty insurance at this time (but we will carry all insurances that we are required to by law, such as motor vehicle and workers&#8217; compensation, plus other coverage that may be in the best interest of the Company). Even if we do obtain insurance, it may not cover all of the risks associated with our operations. Insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and operations are often not available to us or to other companies in our business on acceptable terms. Should any events against which we are not insured actually occur, we may become subject to substantial losses, costs and liabilities, which will adversely affect our financial condition. 

&#160; 

Reclamation obligations could require significant additional expenditures. 

&#160; 

We are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to any exploratory and mining activities. The satisfaction of current and future bonding requirements and reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk we will be unable to fund these additional bonding requirements, and further, increases to our bonding requirements or excessive actual reclamation costs will negatively affect our financial position and results of operation. 

&#160; 

Title to mineral properties can be uncertain, and we are at risk of loss of ownership of our property. 

&#160; 

Our ability to explore and mine future leased and optioned properties depends on the validity of title to that property. These uncertainties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, failure to meet statutory guidelines, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. Since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry. Thus, there may be challenges to the title to future properties, which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations. 

&#160; 

The probability of a mining claim having the necessary quantity and quality to result in a profitable mining operation is uncertain, and our claims, even with large investments by us, may never generate a profit. 

&#160; 

We are dependent upon the successful exploration of our mining property and the discovery of valuable mineralization on the property. All anticipated future revenues would come directly or indirectly from the UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico projects. Should we fail to locate economically extractable mineralization on our property, or enter into an agreement to option and sell our interests to some other mining operation, we will have no revenue and our business will fail. 

&#160; 

Our ongoing operations and past mining activities of others are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations. 

&#160; 

Mining exploration and exploitation activities are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including laws regulating the removal of natural resources from the ground and the discharge of materials into the environment. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Exploration and exploitation activities are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of exploration methods and equipment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Environmental and other legal standards imposed by federal, state or local authorities are constantly evolving, and typically in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, and increased fines and penalties for non-compliance. Such changes may prevent us from conducting planned activities or increase our costs of doing so, which would have material adverse effects on our business. Moreover, compliance with such laws may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated, thus causing an adverse effect on us. Additionally, we may be subject to liability for pollution or other environmental damages that we may not be able to or elect not to insure against due to prohibitive premium costs and other reasons. Unknown environmental hazards may exist on UP &#38; Burlington and/or on Clavo Rico, or we may acquire properties in the future that have unknown environmental issues caused by previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. 

&#160; 

We could be exposed to significant liability for violations of hazardous substances laws because of the use or presence of such substances at our project. 

&#160; 

Our mining operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local statutory and regulatory standards relating to the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances. We use cyanide, propane and industrial lubricants and other substances at our mining locations, which are or could become classified as hazardous substances. If it is discovered that any hazardous substances have been released into the environment at or by the project in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits, we could become liable for the investigation and removal of those substances, regardless of their source and time of release. If we fail to comply with these laws, ordinances or regulations (or any change thereto), we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, the imposition of liens or fines, and large expenditures to bring the project into compliance. Furthermore, we may be held liable for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at other locations where we arranged for disposal of those substances, even if we did not cause the release at that location. The cost of any remediation activities in connection with a spill or other release of such substances could be significant. 

&#160; 

UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico are subject to royalties on production. 

&#160; 

As part of our purchase of UP &#38; Burlington, we granted a Net Smelter Royalty (&#8220;NSR&#8221;) of 3%. Additionally, our Clavo Rico project has a NSR of 5% in addition to a refinery royalty of 3%. In addition, claims made by currently-unknown third parties for historical royalties may be asserted against us. 

&#160; 

Our industry is highly competitive, attractive mineral lands are scarce, and we may not be able to obtain quality properties. 

&#160; 

We compete with many companies in the mining industry, including large, established mining companies with capabilities, personnel and financial resources that far exceed our limited resources. In addition, there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease or acquisition in the United States, and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. We are at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these larger individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. Likewise, our competition extends to locating and employing competent personnel and contractors to prospect, develop and operate mining properties. Many of our competitors can offer attractive compensation packages that we may not be able to meet. Such competition may result in our company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business. 

&#160; 

We depend on our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and the loss of these individuals could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Our company is completely dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ahlin, and our Chief Financial Officer, Trent D&#8217;Ambrosio who are also members of our Board of Directors. As of the date of this report the two are significant to the company. Thus, the loss of either Ahlin or D&#8217;Ambrosio could significantly and adversely affect our business, and certainly the loss of both of these individuals on or about the same time could result in a complete failure of the Company. We do not carry any life insurance on the life of Ahlin or D&#8217;Ambrosio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses that could materially and adversely affect our operations. 

&#160; 

Exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of economically feasible mineralization. Few properties that are explored are ultimately advanced to the stage of producing mines. We are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties such as, but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; economically insufficient mineralized material; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; fluctuations in production costs that may make mining uneconomical; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; labor disputes; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; environmental hazards; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; water conditions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; difficult surface or underground conditions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; industrial accidents, such as personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins, and landslides; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; metallurgical and other processing problems; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; mechanical and equipment performance problems; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; decreases in revenues and reserves due to lower gold and mineral prices. &#160; 

Any of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures and production commencement dates. We currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent that are not recoverable. 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to permitting requirements that could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations on our mining property. 

&#160; 

Our operations and exploration activities require permits from the local, state and federal governments. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for Inception will be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We may never find commercially viable gold or other reserves on UP and Burlington. 

&#160; 

Mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. We cannot assure you that any future mineral exploration and development activities will result in any discoveries of proven or probable reserves as defined by the SEC since such discoveries are remote. Nor can we provide any assurance that, even if we discover commercial quantities of mineralization, a mineral property will be brought into commercial production. Development of our mineral properties will follow only upon obtaining sufficient funding and satisfactory exploration results. 

&#160; 

Mineral deposit estimates are imprecise and subject to error. 

&#160; 

Mineral deposit estimation calculations may prove unreliable. Assumptions made regarding the supporting data may prove inaccurate and unforeseen events may lead to further inaccuracies. Sample variability, mining and processing adjustments, environmental changes, metal price fluctuations, and law and regulation changes are all factors that could lead to deviances from any original estimations. Despite future investment in exploration activities, there is no guarantee we will locate additional commercially viable ore deposits or reserves. Most exploration projects do not result in discovery of commercially viable and mineable ore deposits. With little capital available, we will have to limit our exploration, which decreases the chances of finding a commercially viable ore body. Even if potentially promising mineralization is identified at UP &#38; Burlington, we may choose to not begin production due to high extraction costs, low gold prices, or inadequate amount and reduced recovery rates. Further, we may cease our production operations at Clavo Rico due to high extraction costs, low gold prices, or inadequate amount and reduced recovery rates. If exploration activities do not suggest a commercially successful prospect, then we may altogether abandon plans to pursue efforts to further develop these properties. 

&#160; 

Historical production of gold at UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico may not be indicative of the potential for future development or revenue. 

&#160; 

Historical production of gold and minerals from UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico cannot be relied upon as an indication that these mines will have commercially feasible reserves. Investors in our securities should not rely on historical operations of UP &#38; Burlington and Clavo Rico as an indication that we will be able to place them into commercial production again. We expect to incur losses unless and until such time as the properties enter into commercial production and generate sufficient revenue to fund our continuing operations. 

&#160; 

Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

In their audit opinion issued in connection with our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and our related consolidated statements of operations, deficiency in stockholders&#8217; deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our recurring net losses, negative cash flows from operations and the limited amount of funds on our balance sheet. We have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. This could make it more difficult to raise capital in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Risks Associated with Our Common Stock 

&#160; 

Trading on the Over the Counter markets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. 

&#160; 

Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier of the over-the-counter markets administered by OTC Markets Group, Inc under the symbol &#8220;IMII&#8221;. Trading in stock quoted on over the counter markets is often thin, volatile, and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the over the counter markets are not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the over the counter markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on other stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ Stock Market, New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. 

&#160; 

Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC&#8217;s penny stock regulations and the FINRA&#8217;s sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholders&#8217; ability to buy and sell our stock. 

&#160; 

Our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers&#8217; account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#8217;s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage broker-dealer and investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 

&#160; 

Our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuation which could adversely impact the value of our common stock. 

&#160; 

There has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either develop or be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time. 

&#160; 

FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders&#8217; ability to buy and sell our stock. 

&#160; 

In addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade our securities. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares, which may cause the value of your investment to decline. 

&#160; 

Our shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a written agreement prior from you to making a sale on your behalf. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that broker-dealers will not want to make a market in our common stock. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your investment to decline. 

&#160; 

A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business. 

&#160; 

A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, or convertible debt instruments, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business. 

&#160; 

Our stock price may be volatile. 

&#160; 

The stock market in general has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; changes in our industry; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; competitive pricing pressures; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our ability to obtain working capital financing; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; additions or departures of key personnel; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; limited &#8220;public float&#8221; in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market prices of our common stock; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; sales of our common stock; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our ability to execute our business plan; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; operating results that fall below expectations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; loss of any strategic relationship; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; regulatory developments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; economic and other external factors; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. &#160; 

In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

&#160; 

We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock to date, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Notwithstanding, we will likely elect to retain any earnings, if any, to finance our growth. Future dividends may also be limited by bank loan agreements or other financing instruments that we may enter into in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. 

&#160; 

Recent federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ are those that address board of directors&#8217; independence, audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics. While our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, we have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. 

&#160; 

Difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations. 

&#160; 

As our business needs expand, we may need to hire a significant number of employees. This expansion may place a significant strain on our managerial and financial resources. To manage the potential growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; improve existing, and implement new, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; install enhanced management information systems; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; train, motivate, and manage our employees. &#160; 

We may not be able to install adequate management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business would be seriously harmed. 

&#160; 

If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives. 

&#160; 

We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, Mr. Ahlin, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. D&#8217;Ambrosio, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Cluff our Consulting Director. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining our employees in the future. 

&#160; 

Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

&#160; 

If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an &#8220;overhang&#8221; and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. 

&#160;
