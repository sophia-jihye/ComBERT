 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Delek Logistics Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2012 by Delek US Holdings, Inc. ("Delek") and its indirect subsidiary, Delek Logistics GP, LLC, which is our general partner ("GP" or "general partner"). Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires, "Delek" and "Sponsor" refer collectively to Delek and any of its subsidiaries, other than the Partnership, its subsidiaries and its general partner. In November 2012, the Partnership completed its initial public offering (the "Offering"). 

The Partnership's business primarily consists of certain crude oil, intermediate and refined products pipelines and transportation, storage, wholesale marketing, terminalling and offloading assets which were previously owned, operated or held by Delek and assets acquired from unrelated third parties. Irrespective of the party from whom we acquired our assets, Delek is our primary or sole customer for a substantial majority of our assets and is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the majority of our gross margin (as defined below). 

&#32;Overview 

The Partnership primarily owns and operates logistics and marketing assets for crude oil and intermediate and refined products. We generate revenue and contribution margin, which we define as net sales less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, by charging fees for gathering, transporting and storing crude oil, for storing intermediate products and feed stocks, and for marketing, wholesale marketing, distributing, transporting and storing refined products. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent on the success of Delek's refining operations and most of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek in support of Delek's refineries in Tyler, Texas (the "Tyler Refinery") and El Dorado, Arkansas (the "El Dorado Refinery"). See "&#8212;Commercial Agreements&#8212;Commercial Agreements with Delek" and Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. In addition to the services we provide to Delek, we also provide, and generate substantial revenue and contribution margin, from crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation services for, and terminalling and marketing services to, third parties primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas. Certain of these services are provided pursuant to contractual agreements with such third parties. See "&#8212;Commercial Agreements&#8212;Other Agreements with Third Parties." 

We are not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and the fair market value of our assets and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities, the acquisition price of their units and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. 

&#32;3 

2015 Developments 

Paline Pipeline Capacity Reservation 

Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into separate agreements with two unrelated third parties for such parties to reserve certain capacity on the Paline Pipeline. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, each unrelated third party pays a fixed monthly fee for the exclusive right to use its respective reserved capacity on the pipeline, which together account for a combined 35,000 barrels per day ("bpd"). The initial term of each agreement runs through June 30, 2016. We have the right to extend one of the agreements for a term ending on December 31, 2016, for a total reservation of 10,000 bpd. 

Acquisitions 

On March 31, 2015, the Partnership completed transactions with Delek to acquire the following: 

&#8226; 

&#32;two crude oil rail offloading racks, which are designed to receive up to 25,000 bpd of light crude oil or 12,000 bpd of heavy crude oil, or any combination of the two, delivered by rail to the El Dorado Refinery and related ancillary assets (the &#8220;El Dorado Assets&#8221;) (such transaction, the "El Dorado Offloading Racks Acquisition"); and 

&#8226; 

&#32;a crude oil storage tank (the "Tyler Crude Tank") located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery and certain ancillary assets (collectively with the Tyler Crude Tank, the "Tyler Assets") (such transaction, the "Tyler Crude Tank Acquisition"). 

Other Developments 

Joint Ventures. On March 20, 2015, we entered into two joint ventures with unrelated third parties that are currently constructing logistics assets, that we anticipate will serve interested parties. Our total projected investment for the two joint ventures is approximately $96.0 million and will be financed through a combination of cash from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and asset contributions. These assets are expected to include the following: 

&#8226; 

an 80-mile pipeline with a capacity of 80,000 bpd that originates in Longview, Texas with destinations in the Shreveport, Louisiana area (the "Caddo Pipeline"); and 

&#8226; 

a 109-mile pipeline with a capacity of 55,000 bpd, with the capability to expand to 85,000 bpd, that originates in north Loving County, Texas near the Texas-New Mexico border and terminates in Midland, Texas ("the RIO Pipeline"). 

The joint venture that will construct and own the Caddo Pipeline was formed pursuant to an agreement between our subsidiary DKL Caddo, LLC ("DKL Caddo") and Plains Pipeline, L.P., an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ("Plains"), under which DKL Caddo and Plains each own a 50% membership interest. The joint venture that will construct and own the RIO Pipeline was formed pursuant to an agreement between our subsidiary DKL RIO, LLC ("DKL RIO") and Rangeland Energy II, LLC ("Rangeland") under which DKL RIO and Rangeland own 33% and 67% membership interests, respectively. 

Inflation Adjustments. On July 1, 2015, the tariffs on our Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under our agreements with Delek and third parties that are subject to adjustment using the FERC indexing increased by approximately 4.6%, the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek and third parties, the fees increased or decreased based on the consumer price index or the producer price index, which increased approximately 0.8% and decreased approximately 0.8%, respectively, the latter only for those agreements pursuant to which the decrease would not have reduced the fee to an amount below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. 

&#32;4 

Assets and Operations 

We prepare segment information on the same basis that we review financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Currently, our business consists of two operating segments: (i) pipelines and transportation and (ii) wholesale marketing and terminalling. Additional segment and financial information is contained in our segment results included in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 15 , Segment Data, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our principal assets, as of December 31, 2015 , are described below under the segment that uses such assets. 

The following provides an overview of our assets and operations: 

Pipelines and Transportation Segment 

Our pipelines and transportation segment consists of assets, including pipelines and trucks and ancillary assets, that provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and finished products transportation and storage services primarily in support of the Tyler and El Dorado Refineries. Additionally, this segment provides crude oil and other products transportation services to certain unrelated third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store; and, therefore, the results of our pipelines and transportation segment are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our pipeline assets include approximately 400 miles of operable crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 366 miles of refined product pipelines and approximately 600 miles of crude oil gathering and trunk lines. Associated with and currently used in connection with the operation of these lines are crude oil, intermediate and refined products storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 7.3 million barrels of active shell capacity. We also own 123 trucks and 205 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil, finished products and other hydrocarbon products for unrelated and related third parties. 

&#160; 

The tables below show the operating results for each of our operating systems within this segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

&#32;5 

Lion Pipeline System. &#32;&#32;Our Lion Pipeline System is a system of common carrier pipelines that transport crude oil to, and refined products from, Delek's El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System consists primarily of: 

&#8226; 

the Magnolia Pipeline system; 

&#8226; 

the El Dorado Pipeline system; 

&#8226; 

multiple short crude oil pipelines located on the El Dorado Refinery and Delek's Sandhill Station; 

&#8226; 

the Magnolia Station located west of the El Dorado Refinery; 

&#8226; 

refined product pipeline capacity leased from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC ("Enterprise") that runs from the El Dorado Refinery to our Memphis terminal; 

&#8226; 

a Refined Products Pipeline system (as defined and described below); and 

&#8226; 

certain related crude oil pipelines. 

The Magnolia Pipeline is an approximately 77-mile crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 68,500 bpd, that runs from a connection with ExxonMobil&#8217;s LOLA System near Shreveport, Louisiana to our Magnolia Station, where the crude oil is then stored and transferred to our El Dorado Pipeline. In addition, a new third-party pipeline links an existing third-party pipeline to the Magnolia Pipeline near Haynesville, Louisiana, which allows for the receipt of crude oil transported from Longview, Texas. The service provided on the Magnolia Pipeline is regulated by the FERC and is subject to FERC tariffs. 

The El Dorado Pipeline is a 28-mile, 12-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 22,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from our Magnolia Station to Delek's Sandhill Station adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery. The service provided on the El Dorado Pipeline is regulated by the FERC and is subject to FERC tariffs. Upon reaching the Sandhill Station, the crude oil from the El Dorado Pipeline is transported, via multiple short crude oil pipelines owned by us, to Tank 192, a 150,000 barrel capacity storage tank located at Delek's Sandhill Station ("Tank 192"). At present, substantially all crude oil that enters the El Dorado Refinery, including the crude oil gathered on the SALA Gathering System, is first routed to Tank 192. Through our SALA subsidiary, we own Tank 192 and lease the underlying ground from Lion Oil under a long-term ground lease. 

The Magnolia Station is a location owned by us where the Magnolia and Lion Pipelines and SALA Gathering System have origination and destination points, as the case may be. In addition, the Magnolia Station has storage facilities with approximately 135,000 barrels of active shell capacity. 

We also own two refined product pipelines that transport gasoline and diesel from the El Dorado Refinery to the nearby Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station (the &#8220;Refined Products Pipelines&#8221;). Pursuant to a capacity lease with Enterprise dated October 24, 2013, we also lease capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd on the Enterprise Products Pipeline from Enterprise's El Dorado Station to our refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The Refined Products Pipelines along with the leased capacity are collectively referred to as the "Refined Products Pipeline System." The service provided on the Refined Products Pipelines is regulated by the FERC and is subject to a FERC tariff. The diesel line is 12 inches in diameter while the gasoline line is 10 inches in diameter. These two lines commence at the El Dorado Refinery. We own the portion of these lines that commence at the Sandhill Station at the location of the pump for each line and runs approximately eight miles to the Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station. From this point, service continues on the Enterprise TE Products Pipeline to destinations along its system and on capacity we lease from Enterprise to our terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The service provided on the Refined Products Pipeline System, including on the capacity leased from Enterprise, is regulated by the FERC. 

The pipelines in the Lion Pipeline System also have injection points where crude oil gathered from the SALA Gathering System can be injected and then transported to the El Dorado Refinery. Movements from the SALA Gathering System onto the Lion Pipeline System to the El Dorado Refinery are subject to a joint tariff for the transportation of these volumes that is on file with the FERC for both the SALA Gathering System and the El Dorado Pipeline; the joint rate for these movements is equal to the rate that would apply for movements only on the SALA Gathering System to the connection point with the Lion Pipeline System. The Lion Pipeline System has crude oil storage tanks and facilities ancillary to the operation of the pipeline system. The Lion Pipeline System is capable of transporting crude oil offloaded from rail cars at or near the El Dorado Refinery, including at the El Dorado Assets.

SALA Gathering System. &#32;&#32;The SALA Gathering System is a system of common carrier pipelines that primarily gathers and transports crude oil and condensate that is purchased from various crude oil producers in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana by Delek or a third party to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. Service on the SALA Gathering System is regulated by the FERC and is subject to tariffs on file with the FERC. The SALA Gathering System includes approximately 600 miles of two- to eight-inch crude oil gathering and transportation lines in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana located primarily within a 60-mile radius of the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the gathering system transports small volumes of crude oil that are received from other sources and condensate that is purchased from a third party in east Texas. All such crude oil and other products are ultimately transported to the El Dorado Refinery for processing. In addition, a pipeline within the SALA Gathering System transports minimal crude oil for third party shippers pursuant to a common carrier tariff. 

The SALA Gathering System includes 53 crude oil storage tanks and breakout tanks with a total combined active shell capacity of approximately 0.8 million barrels (including Tank 192 and approximately 42,000 barrels of capacity we lease to an unrelated third party), 14 truck receipt locations, approximately 500 pipeline gathering and receiving stations and 17 relay stations to deliver crude oil to the Magnolia Station, the El Dorado Pipeline System or directly to the El Dorado Refinery. We also have approximately 0.5 million barrels of combined shell capacity that is currently not in service. The table below sets forth historical throughput information for the SALA Gathering System.

Paline Pipeline System. Our Paline Pipeline System is primarily a 195-mile, 10-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 36,000 bpd, running from Longview, Texas to the Phillips 66-operated Beaumont terminal in Nederland, Texas. It includes a three-mile section that runs north from Kilgore, Texas. The three-mile section of pipeline is operated as a common carrier pipeline and the service is regulated by the FERC. The remainder is subject to current capacity agreements with unrelated third parties. See Item 1, "Business&#8212;2015 Developments&#8212;Paline Pipeline Capacity Reservation" for additional information on these agreements. 

East Texas Crude Logistics System. &#32;&#32;Our East Texas Crude Logistics System includes two owned and operated crude oil pipeline systems and their related tank farms, which serve the Tyler Refinery: (i) the Nettleton pipeline, a bi-directional 36-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 38,000 bpd, that is capable of transporting crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas to (a) the Bullard Junction at the Tyler Refinery and (b) to other of our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and (ii) the McMurrey Pipeline System, a 65-mile pipeline system, with a capacity of approximately 28,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and runs roughly parallel to the Nettleton Pipeline. While service on the East Texas Crude Logistics System may otherwise be interstate commerce and subject to the common carrier regulation and jurisdiction of FERC, it is currently subject to a temporary waiver issued by FERC on October 23, 2012, waiving the otherwise applicable tariff filing and reporting requirements for common carrier interstate service providers (the &#8220;East Texas Waiver Order&#8221;). The continuing effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver 

&#32;7 

Order depends upon the continuation in effect of the following conditions: (1) our affiliates continuing to own 100% of the throughput; (2) there being no demonstrated third party interest in shipping on the system; (3) our not anticipating any such interest materializing; and (4) there remaining no demonstrated opposition to the continuing effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver Order. 

Our East Texas Crude Logistics System also includes five owned or leased crude oil storage terminals at which we store crude oil owned by Delek for the Tyler Refinery. The LaGloria Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. The Nettleton Station consists of five tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 222,000 barrels. It is located on property that we lease from a third party as described in more detail in Item 2, "Facilities." In addition to the active shell capacity, the Nettleton Station includes approximately 55,000 barrels of shell capacity that is currently not in service. The Bradford Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 65,000 barrels. The Arp Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 110,000 barrels. The Big Sandy Station consists of seven tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 248,000 barrels.

We have a pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek to provide throughput on the East Texas Crude Logistics System. However, in April 2013, a reconfigured pipeline system that is owned and operated by third parties began transporting crude oil to the Tyler Refinery from west Texas. Delek has a 10-year agreement, with an initial term expiring in 2022, with such third parties to transport a substantial majority of the Tyler Refinery&#8217;s crude oil requirements on this reconfigured pipeline system. As a result of the third parties' ability to transport crude oil on its reconfigured pipeline system directly to the Tyler Refinery, the crude oil supplied through the Nettleton and McMurrey Pipelines fell below the minimum aggregate throughput requirements of our pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek during the second quarter of 2013 and has remained below the minimum aggregate throughput requirements since that time. We expect crude oil volumes transported on our East Texas Crude Logistics System to continue to be below the minimum throughput requirement of 35,000 bpd for the foreseeable future. However, until November 2017, Delek is required under its commercial agreement with us, to pay us throughput fees in an amount equal to the fees it would pay were we to throughput 35,000 bpd, based on the per barrel fees in our agreement. 

&#160; 

Tyler-Big Sandy Pipeline. The Tyler-Big Sandy Pipeline is essentially one pipeline link between the Tyler Refinery and the Partnership's terminal at Big Sandy, Texas that consists of the following two pipelines, which effectively connect at the Hopewell Station: (i) the Hopewell Pipeline, an approximately 13-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which &#32; originates at the Tyler Refinery and terminates at the Hopewell Station, and (ii) the Big Sandy Pipeline, a 19-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which originates at the Hopewell Station and terminates at the Big Sandy Terminal. The Big Sandy Terminal has 13 tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 177,000 barrels. Service on the Tyler-Big Sandy Pipeline is not provided for third parties, and is classified as private intrastate carrier service. 

&#160; 

Tyler Tank Assets. The Tyler Tank Assets consist of 96 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the Tyler Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.0 million barrels. 

El Dorado Tank Assets. &#32;&#32;The El Dorado Tank Assets consist of 158 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels. 

&#160; 

Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline and Greenville Storage Facilit y. The Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is a 76-mile pipeline, connecting the Greenville Storage Facility and the Mount Pleasant Terminal. The service provided on the Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission, subject to a tariff on file with that Commission. The Greenville Storage Facility has four tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 330,000 barrels and is connected to the Explorer Pipeline System. 

&#32;8 

North Little Rock Tanks . Our terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas has five tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels. 

&#160; 

FTT Trucking Assets. &#32;We own 123 trucks and 205 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for third parties and Delek. 

El Dorado Offloading Racks . The El Dorado Offloading Racks consist of two crude oil rail offloading racks, which are designed to receive up to 25,000 bpd of light crude oil or 12,000 bpd of heavy crude oil, or any combination of the two, delivered by rail to the El Dorado Refinery and related ancillary assets. 

Tyler Crude Tank. &#32;&#32;The Tyler Crude Tank is a crude oil storage tank and certain ancillary assets located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery. The Tyler Crude Tank has approximately 350,000 barrels of shell capacity and primarily supports the Tyler Refinery. 

Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment 

Our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides wholesale marketing and terminalling services to Delek&#8217;s refining operations and to independent third parties from whom we receive fees for marketing, transporting, storing and terminalling refined products and to whom we wholesale market refined products. In providing certain of these services, we take ownership of the products and are therefore exposed to market risks related to the volatility of refined product prices in our west Texas operations, which depend on many factors, including demand and supply of refined products in the west Texas market, the timing of refined product deliveries and downtime at refineries in the surrounding area. As of December 31, 2015 , we generated revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by (i) providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery, (ii) engaging in wholesale activity at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, as well as at terminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and (iii) providing terminalling services to independent third parties and Delek. See &#8220;&#8212;Commercial Agreements&#8212;Other Agreements with Third Parties&#8212;West Texas." Also see Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. The tables below show the operating results for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we present the results for the period during which we owned the assets, as delineated in any notes accompanying the tables.

Commercial Agreements 

Commercial Agreements with Delek 

The Partnership has various agreements with Delek, the majority of which are structured as long-term, fee-based commercial agreements under which we provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services, and marketing, terminalling and offloading services to Delek. These agreements have an initial term ranging from five to ten years, which may be extended for various renewal terms at the option of Delek. These agreements typically include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments. Fees under each agreement are payable to us monthly by Delek or certain third parties to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. For a discussion of a third party's involvement in certain agreements, see "Delek's Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement." In most circumstances, if Delek or the applicable third party assignee fails to meet or exceed the minimum volume, throughput or other commitment during any calendar quarter, Delek, and not any third party assignee, will be required to make a quarterly shortfall payment to us equal to the volume or amount of the shortfall multiplied or increased by the applicable fee. Carry-over of any volumes in excess of such commitment to any subsequent quarter is not permitted. Exceptions to this requirement that Delek make minimum payments under a given agreement may exist under certain of these agreements if (i) there is an event of force majeure affecting our asset, or (ii) after the first three years of the applicable commercial agreement's term (a) there is an event of force majeure affecting the applicable Delek asset or (b) if Delek shuts down the applicable refinery upon giving 12 months' notice, which such notice may only be given after the first two years of the applicable commercial agreement's term. In addition, Delek may terminate any of these agreements under certain circumstances. 

The tariffs and throughput and storage fees under our agreements with Delek are subject to increase or decrease annually, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index, the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. 

See Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. 

Other Agreements with Delek 

In addition to the commercial agreements described above, the Partnership has entered into the following agreement with Delek: 

Omnibus Agreement. &#32;&#32;The Partnership entered into an omnibus agreement with Delek, our general partner, Delek Logistics Operating LLC ("OpCo") and certain of the Partnership&#8217;s and Delek&#8217;s other subsidiaries on November 7, 2012, which was subsequently amended and restated on July 26, 2013, February 10, 2014 and March 31, 2015 in connection with our subsequent acquisitions from Delek (collectively, the "Omnibus Agreement"). The third amended and restated omnibus agreement, entered into effective March 31, 2015 provided for the following: (i) revisions of the schedules to include the El Dorado Assets and the Tyler Assets, (ii) revisions of certain provisions and schedules with respect to certain environmental matters, (iii) the addition of DKL Transportation, LLC as a party to the agreement, (iv) the elimination of certain provisions under the Omnibus Agreement that had expired, and (v) updating the annual administrative fee payable by us to Delek for general corporate and administrative services that Delek and its affiliates provide to us to reflect the inflationary increase provided under the Omnibus Agreement, from $3.3 million to $3.4 million, which is prorated and payable monthly. The Partnership entered into an amendment to the third amended and restated omnibus agreement on August 3, 2015, with an effective date of April 1, 2015 to eliminate a $1.0 million per event deductible that applied to certain asset failures before Delek was required to reimburse the Partnership. The third amended and restated omnibus agreement between the Partnership, Delek and the general partner, as amended, is referred to as the "Third Restated Omnibus Agreement". 

Other Agreements with Third Parties 

Paline Pipeline System Capacity Reservation . Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into separate agreements with two unrelated third parties for such parties to reserve certain capacity on the Paline Pipeline. See Item 1, "Business&#8212;2015 Developments&#8212;Paline Pipeline Capacity Reservation" for additional information on these agreements. 

West Texas. &#32;In our west Texas marketing operations, we generate revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and Delek for sale and exchange to third parties at our San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. Substantially all of our product sales in west Texas are on a wholesale basis. The majority of the petroleum products we sell in west Texas are purchased from Noble Petro. Under the terms of the Abilene Contract with Noble Petro, we have the right to purchase up to 20,350 bpd of petroleum products. Under this contract, we purchase petroleum products based on monthly average prices from Noble Petro immediately prior to our resale of such products to customers at our San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals, which we lease to Noble Petro. Under this arrangement, we have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating 

&#32;12 

prices for these refined products due to the short period of time between the purchase and resale of these refined products. The Abilene Contract expires in December 2017 and does not have a renewal option. 

Delek's Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement 

Pursuant to an arrangement with Delek and Lion Oil, to which we are not a party, J. Aron acquires and holds title to substantially all crude oil and refined products transported on our Lion Pipeline System and SALA Gathering System. J. Aron is therefore considered the shipper for the liquid it owns on the Lion Pipeline System and the SALA Gathering System. J. Aron also has title to the refined products stored at our Memphis, North Little Rock and El Dorado terminals and in the El Dorado Storage Tanks. Under (i) our pipelines and storage agreement with Lion Oil relating to the Lion Pipeline System and the SALA Gathering System, (ii) our terminalling agreements with Lion Oil relating to the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, and (iii) our throughput and tankage agreement relating to the El Dorado Terminal and Tank Assets, Lion Oil has assigned to J. Aron certain of its rights under these agreements, including the right to have J. Aron's crude oil and intermediate and refined products stored in or transported on or through these systems, the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals and the El Dorado Terminal and Tank Assets, with Lion Oil acting as J. Aron's agent for scheduling purposes. Accordingly, even though this is effectively a financing arrangement for Delek whereby J. Aron sells the product back to Delek, J. Aron is technically our primary customer under each of these agreements. J. Aron will retain these storage and transportation rights for the term of its arrangement with Delek and Lion Oil, which currently runs through April 30, 2017, and J. Aron will pay us for the transportation, throughput and storage services we provide to it. The rights assigned to J. Aron will not alter Lion Oil's obligations to meet certain throughput minimum volumes under our agreements with respect to the transportation, throughputting and storage of crude oil and refined products through our facilities, but J. Aron's throughput will be credited toward Lion Oil's minimum throughput commitments. Accordingly, Lion Oil will be responsible for making any shortfall payments incurred under the pipelines and storage agreement or the terminalling agreement which may result from minimum throughputs or volumes not being met. 

Customers 

We are dependent upon Delek as our primary customer and the loss of Delek as a customer would have an adverse effect on both of our operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our gross margin, which is defined as net sales less cost of goods sold, from fee-based commercial agreements with Delek or as a direct result of its operations. For more information pertaining to these agreements, please see "&#8212;Commercial Agreements." We also have other customers, including major oil companies, independent refiners and marketers, jobbers, distributors, utility and transportation companies, and independent retail fuel operators. 

Major Customers 

Sunoco LP accounted for 16.2% , 23.3% &#32;and 17.7% &#32;of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Delek, directly or indirectly, accounted for 24.2% , 13.6% &#32;and 8.6% &#32;of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. However, we believe that gross margin is a better measure of performance of our business than revenue, particularly in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, as total revenue varies with the price of the underlying product, such as a gallon of finished product. Accordingly, we believe that, for the purpose of evaluating our business on a customer-specific basis, gross margin is a more accurate indicator to reflect the importance of certain customers to our operations. Delek, directly or indirectly, accounted for 90.0% , 76.6% , and 79.5% &#32;of our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

&#32;13 

Competition 

Pipelines and Transportation &#32; 

Our business in this segment primarily consists of gathering, transporting and storing crude oil, intermediate and finished products for Delek and third parties, especially other refiners. We face competition for the transportation and storage of crude oil from other pipeline owners whose pipelines or storage facilities (i) may have a location advantage over our pipelines or storage facilities, (ii) may be able to transport or store more desirable crude oil or finished products to Delek or to third parties, (iii) may be able to transport or store crude oil or finished product at a lower rate, or (iv) may be able to store more crude oil or finished product. Any or all such factors could cause Delek or our third-party customers to reduce throughput to a level that is below the minimum throughput commitments established in any contracts we may have with them or determine not to renew such contracts when the term expires. 

As a result of our physical integration with Delek's El Dorado Refinery and our contractual relationships with Delek relative to the El Dorado Refinery, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the transportation of crude oil or refined products to or from the El Dorado Refinery, particularly during the term of our Lion Pipeline System, SALA Gathering System, El Dorado Tank Assets and El Dorado Assets agreements with Delek. See Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. 

Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling 

The wholesale marketing and terminalling business is generally very competitive. Our owned refined product terminals, as well as the other third-party terminals we use to sell refined product, compete with other independent terminal operators as well as integrated oil companies on the basis of terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. The costs associated with transporting products from a loading terminal to end users usually limit the geographic size of the market that can be served economically by any terminal. Two key markets in west Texas that we serve from our owned facilities are Abilene and San Angelo, Texas. We have direct competition from an independent refinery that markets through another terminal in the Abilene market. However, there are no competitive fuel loading terminals within approximately 90 miles of our San Angelo terminal. Our Nashville terminal competes with a significant number of other terminals located in the greater Nashville area. With respect to terminalling services we provide to Delek at our Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, as a result of our exclusive terminalling agreements, we do not believe we will face significant competition from third parties for these services. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to an exclusive 10-year marketing agreement with Delek, the initial term of which expires in 2022, we market 100% of the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery (other than jet fuel and petroleum coke). As a result, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for these services from third parties. In addition, as a result of our physical integration with the Tyler Refinery and our contractual relationships with Delek relative to the Tyler Refinery, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the storage or throughput of intermediate or refined products at the Tyler Refinery, particularly during the term of our agreements with Delek. See Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. Should Delek's wholesale customers, however, reduce their purchases of refined products due to the increased availability of more competitively priced products from other suppliers or for other reasons, the volumes we sell under the aforementioned agreement could decrease below the minimum volume commitment under the contract. Delek's Tyler Refinery is the only full-range product supplier within 100 miles; therefore, we believe its location gives the Tyler Refinery a natural advantage over more distant competitors. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Rate Regulation of Petroleum Pipelines 

The rates and terms and conditions of service on certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (&#8220;ICA&#8221;) and by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including the Railroad Commission of Texas, the Louisiana Public Service Commission, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission. Certain of our pipeline systems are subject to such regulation and have filed tariffs with the appropriate authorities. We 

&#32;14 

also comply with the reporting requirements for these pipelines. Other of our pipelines have received a waiver from application of the FERC's tariff requirements but comply with other applicable regulatory requirements. 

The FERC regulates interstate transportation under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including pipelines that transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products in interstate commerce (collectively referred to as &#8220;petroleum pipelines&#8221;), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the FERC. Under the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. Tariff rates are typically contractually subject to increase or decrease on July 1 of each year, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index, the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. 

While the FERC regulates rates for shipments of crude oil or refined products in interstate commerce, state agencies may regulate rates and service for shipments in intrastate commerce. We own pipeline assets in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana; accordingly such assets may be subject to additional regulation by the applicable governmental authorities in those states. Without limitation, certain of our pipeline assets in Texas are operated under Texas Railroad Commission regulation and subject to filed tariffs with that agency. See Item 1, "Business&#8212;Pipelines and Transportation&#8212;Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline and Greenville Storage Facility" for additional information on these tariffs. In Texas, a pipeline, with some exceptions, is required to operate as a common carrier by publishing tariffs and providing transportation without discrimination. Arkansas provides that all intrastate oil pipelines are common carriers. In Louisiana, all pipelines conveying petroleum from a point of origin within the state to a destination within the state are declared common carriers. The Louisiana Public Service Commission is empowered with the authority to establish reasonable rates and regulations for the transport of petroleum by a common carrier, mandating public tariffs and providing of transportation without discrimination. State commissions have generally not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines, have generally not investigated the rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints, and generally resolve shipper complaints informally. 

Whether a pipeline provides service in interstate commerce or intrastate commerce is highly fact-dependent and determined on a case-by-case basis. We cannot provide assurance that the FERC will not at some point assert that some or all of the transportation service we provide, for which we do not have a tariff on file at the FERC, is within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were successful with any such assertion, the FERC's ratemaking methodologies may subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. Service on the East Texas Crude Logistics System is currently subject to a temporary waiver issued by FERC as discussed above in Item 1, "Business&#8212;Pipelines and Transportation&#8212;East Texas Crude Logistics System." If the conditions to the continued effectiveness of that East Texas Waiver Order are no longer true at any point, service on that system would become fully subject to FERC tariff filing requirements and other regulatory requirements for the provision of transportation service. 

Department of Transportation 

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") of the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") regulates the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, reporting and emergency response of crude oil, petroleum products and other hazardous liquids pipelines and other facilities, including certain tank facilities used in the transportation of such liquids. These requirements are complex, subject to change and, in certain cases, can be costly to comply with. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations but cannot assure you substantial expenditures on our part will not be required to remain in compliance. Moreover, certain of these rules are difficult to insure adequately and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to address costs and damages from any noncompliance. 

&#160; 

The United States Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (or Pipeline Safety Act) was enacted on January 3, 2012, pursuant to which the maximum civil penalties for certain violations were increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. A number of the provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. We intend to work closely with our industry associations to participate with and monitor DOT-PHMSA's efforts. 

The DOT has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities against terrorist attack. We have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities. We cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack. 

&#32;15 

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the DOT regulates safety standards and monitors drivers and equipment of commercial motor carrier fleets. Such standards include vehicle and maintenance inspection requirements, limitations on the number of hours drivers may operate vehicles, and financial responsibility requirements. We believe that the operations of our fleet of crude oil and finished products truck transports are substantially in compliance with these regulations and safety requirements. 

Environmental Health and Safety 

We are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination and the protection of workers and the public. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to develop, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Numerous permits or other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our terminals, pipelines, and related operations, and may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal. These laws and permits may become the basis for future claims and lawsuits involving environmental and safety matters, which could include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed of, or that relate to pre-existing conditions for which we have assumed or are assigned responsibility. 

We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental, health and safety requirements. However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes by regulatory authorities, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory or judicial authorities. The legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to respond to, contain and remediate a release, to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury, property damage, or natural resources damages. See "&#8212;Hazardous Substances and Waste" below for additional information on regulations pertaining to releases into the environment. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. There have been and will continue to be ongoing discussions about environmental and safety matters between us and federal and state authorities, including notices of violations, citations and other enforcement actions, some of which have resulted or may result in changes to operating procedures and in capital expenditures. 

Indemnification 

Under the Omnibus Agreement, Delek has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental matters associated with the ownership of our assets at or before the closing of our initial public offering (the "Offering") and subsequent acquisitions from Delek. 

Air Emissions and Climate Change 

Our operations are subject to the United States Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. Any such future obligations may require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs. These air emissions requirements also affect Delek's refineries, from which we receive a substantial portion of our revenues. In the future, Delek may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to comply with new legislative and regulatory requirements relating to its operations. To the extent these capital expenditures have a material effect on Delek, they could have a material effect on our business and results of operations. 

In addition, on April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that subject oil and natural gas operations, including production, processing, transmission, and storage to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) programs. The finalized regulations establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. In addition, in September 2015, the EPA published proposed updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls 

&#32;16 

on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations. We do not expect these rules to have a significant impact on our business. 

Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and other gases) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include requirements effective in January 2010 to report emissions of greenhouse gases to the EPA beginning in 2011, proposed federal regulation (and, from time to time, federal legislation) as well as state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which require or could require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of Delek. None of our facilities is presently subject to the federal greenhouse gas reporting rule or the greenhouse gas &#8220;tailoring&#8221; rule, which subjects certain facilities to the additional permitting obligations under the NSR/PSD and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on a facility&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions. 

As such, we do not expect any substantial impacts from the tailoring rule on our facilities. New or modified legislation or regulation requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. These requirements may also significantly affect Delek&#8217;s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our products and services." 

On October 23, 2015, the EPA published as a final rule the Clean Power Plan, which sets performance rates for GHG emissions from power generating units firing coal, oil or natural gas. While we do not operate power plants governed by this final rule, it remains unclear what impact the rule may have on demand for oil, coal, natural gas and renewable energy sources, including crude oil and refined products transported and stored by us. These and other GHG-related requirements that disproportionately affect the cost of energy from oil in comparison to competing energy sources could affect demand for our services. The U.S. Supreme Court recently stayed the Clean Power Plan final rule until pending legal challenges are resolved. 

Renewable Fuel Standard 

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ("EISA") was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating the Renewable Fuel Standard - 2 (RFS-2) rule, requiring the amounts of renewable fuel sold or introduced in the United States to reach 36 billion gallons by 2022. The EPA has not finalized future volume requirements beyond 2016. The requirements could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks. 

Hazardous Substances and Waste 

To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into water or soils, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), which is also known as Superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites. 

We also generate small quantities of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state laws. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including crude oil and refined products wastes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes. 

&#32;17 

However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Any changes in the regulations could increase our and our competitors&#8217; maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

We currently own and lease, and Delek has in the past owned and leased, properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 

Water 

Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Several of our pipelines and terminals are located near, or cross under or over, environmentally sensitive waters such as streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and wetlands. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA"), the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the "Clean Water Act") and related state requirements. These requirements subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar and, in some cases, more stringent laws. 

Regulations under the Clean Water Act, the OPA and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture, or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at many of our facilities. In addition, the OPA requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with the OPA, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. We regularly review and modify our crude oil and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures to help prevent crude oil and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. 

The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Our facilities contract with third parties for wastewater disposal, discharge to local Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), or discharge under the terms of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for wastewater and stormwater. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. 

Employees 

We have no employees. Rather, all of the employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates, and we believe that our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. 

Seasonality and Customer Maintenance Programs 

The volume and throughput of crude oil and refined products transported through our pipelines and sold through our terminals and to third parties is directly affected by the level of supply and demand for all of such products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Supply and demand for such products fluctuates during the calendar year. Demand for gasoline, for example, is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic. While demand for 

&#32;18 

asphalt products, which are a substantial portion of the El Dorado Refinery's product mix, is also lower in the winter months. In addition, our refining customers, such as Delek, occasionally reduce or suspend operations to perform planned maintenance, which is more typically scheduled during the winter, when demand for their products is lower. Accordingly, these factors affect the need for crude oil or finished products by our customers and therefore limit our volumes or throughput during these periods, and our operating results will generally be lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year. We, believe, however, that many of the potential effects of seasonality on our revenues and contribution margin will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with Delek that include minimum volume and throughput commitments.
