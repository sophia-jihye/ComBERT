 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

Our company, Franklin Street Properties Corp., which we refer to as FSP Corp., the Company, we or our, is a Maryland corporation that operates in a manner intended to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;FSP&#8221;. FSP Corp. is the successor to Franklin Street Partners Limited Partnership, or the FSP Partnership, which was originally formed as a Massachusetts general partnership in January 1997 as the successor to a Massachusetts general partnership that was formed in 1981. On January 1, 2002, the FSP Partnership converted into FSP Corp., which we refer to as the conversion. As a result of this conversion, the FSP Partnership ceased to exist and we succeeded to the business of the FSP Partnership. In the conversion, each unit of both general and limited partnership interests in the FSP Partnership was converted into one share of our common stock. As a result of the conversion, we hold, directly and indirectly, 100% of the interest in three former subsidiaries of the FSP Partnership: FSP Investments LLC, FSP Property Management LLC, and FSP Holdings LLC. We operate some of our business through these subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

We are a REIT focused on commercial real estate investments primarily in office markets and currently operate in only one segment: real estate operations. The principal revenue sources for our real estate operations include rental income from real estate leasing, interest income from secured loans made on office properties, property dispositions and fee income from asset/property management and development. 

&#160; 

Our current strategy is to invest in select urban infill and central business district properties, with primary emphasis on our top five markets of Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis. We believe that our top five markets have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents. We will also monitor San Diego, Silicon Valley, Greater Boston and Greater Washington, DC, as well as other markets, for opportunistic investments. We seek value-oriented investments with an eye towards long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income. 

&#160; 

Previously we also operated in an investment banking segment, which was discontinued in December 2011. Our investment banking segment generated brokerage commissions, loan origination fees, development services and other fees related to the organization of single-purpose entities that own real estate and the private placement of equity in those entities. We refer to these entities, which are organized as corporations and operated in a manner intended to qualify as REITs, as Sponsored REITs. On December 15, 2011, we announced that our broker/dealer subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC, would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly-formed Sponsored REITs. On July 15, 2014, FSP Investments LLC withdrew its registration as a broker/dealer with FINRA. 

&#160; 

From time-to-time we may acquire real estate or invest in real estate by making secured loans on real estate. We may also pursue on a selective basis the sale of our properties to take advantage of the value creation and demand for our properties, or for geographic or property specific reasons. 

&#160; 

Real Estate 

&#160; 

We own and operate a portfolio of real estate consisting of 3 6 office properties as of December 31, 201 5 . We derive rental revenue from income paid to us by tenants of these properties. See Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our properties. From time-to-time we dispose of properties generating gains or losses in an ongoing effort to improve and upgrade our portfolio. We also held preferred stock investments in two Sponsored REITs as of December 31, 201 5 , from which we record our share of income or loss under the equity method of accounting, and from which we receive dividends. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We provide asset management, property management, property accounting, investor and/or development services to our portfolio and certain of our Sponsored REITs through our subsidiaries FSP Investments LLC and FSP Property Management LLC. FSP Corp. recognizes revenue from its receipt of fee income from Sponsored REITs that have not been consolidated or acquired by us. Neither FSP Investments LLC nor FSP Property Management LLC receives any rental income. 

&#160; 

From time-to-time we may make secured loans to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other purposes. We anticipate that these loans will be repaid at their maturity or earlier from long-term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or some other capital event. We refer to these loans as Sponsored REIT Loans. We had six Sponsored REIT Loans secured by real estate out standing as of December 31, 2015 , from which we derive interest income. 

&#160; 

Investment Objectives 

&#160; 

Our investment objectives are to create shareholder value by increasing revenue from rental, dividend, interest and fee income and net gains from sales of properties and increase the cash available for distribution in the form of dividends to our stockholders. We expect that we will continue to derive real estate revenue from owned properties and Sponsored REIT Loans and fees from asset management, property management and investor services. We may also acquire additional real properties. 

&#160; 

We may acquire, and have acquired, real properties in any geographic area of the United States and of any property type. We own 3 6 properties that are located in 13 different states. See Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our properties. 

&#160; 

From time to time, as market conditions warrant, we may sell properties owned by us. We sold an office property located in Plano, Texas on February 23, 2015 at a $1.5 million gain, an office property located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota on March 31, 2015 at a $9.0 million gain , an office property located in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 13, 2015 at a $0.9 million gain and an office property located in San Jose, California on December 9 , 2015 at a $12.3 million gain . We also sold one office property located in Colorado Springs, Colorado on December 3, 2014 at a $0.9 million gain and one office property located in Richardson, Texas on October 29, 2013 at a $2.2 million gain . When we sell a property, we either distribute some or all of the sale proceeds to our stockholders as a distribution or retain some or all of such proceeds for investment in real properties or other corporate activities. 

&#160; 

We rely on the following principles in selecting real properties for acquisition by FSP Corp. and managing them after acquisition: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

we seek to buy or develop investment properties at a price which produces value for investors and avoid overpaying for real estate merely to outbid competitors; 

&#183; 

we seek to buy or develop properties in excellent locations with substantial infrastructure in place around them and avoid investing in locations where the future construction of such infrastructure is speculative; 

&#183; 

we seek to buy or develop properties that are well-constructed and designed to appeal to a broad base of users and avoid properties where quality has been sacrificed for cost savings in construction or which appeal only to a narrow group of users; 

&#183; 

we aggressively manage, maintain and upgrade our properties and refuse to neglect or undercapitalize management, maintenance and capital improvement programs; and 

&#183; 

we believe that we have the ability to hold properties through down cycles because we generally do not have significant leverage on the Company, which could place the properties at risk of foreclosure. As of February 1 2 , 201 6 , none of our 3 6 properties was subject to mortgage debt. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

With respect to our real estate investments, we face competition in each of the markets where our properties are located. In order to establish, maintain or increase the rental revenues for a property, it must be competitive on location, 

&#160;

cost and amenities with other buildings of similar use. Some of our competitors may have significantly more resources than we do and may be able to offer more attractive rental rates or services. On the other hand, some of our competitors may be smaller or have less fixed overhead costs, less cash or other resources that make them willing or able to accept lower rents in order to maintain a certain occupancy level. In markets where there is not currently significant existing property competition, our competitors may decide to enter the market and build new buildings to compete with our existing projects or those in a development stage. Our competition is not only with other developers, but also with property users who choose to own their building or a portion of the building in the form of an office condominium. Competitive conditions are affected by larger market forces beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, that may increase competition among landlords for quality tenants, and individual decisions by tenants that are beyond our control. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had 40 employees as of December 31, 201 5 and 40 employees as of February 1 2 , 201 6 .
