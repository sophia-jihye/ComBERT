The Chief Operating Decision Maker for Food Service and Retail Supermarkets and the Chief Operating Decision Maker for Frozen Beverages monthly review detailed operating income statements and sales reports in order to assess performance and allocate resources to each individual segment.

&#160; 

Certain of the Company&#8217;s soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling a participating school to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of the Company&#8217;s soft pretzels from the USDA. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. Soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by the Company&#8217;s twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, we make soft pretzels which are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily quick-frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal marketing program in the Food Service segment includes supplying ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven. The Company retains ownership of the equipment placed in customer locations, and as a result, customers are not required to make an investment in equipment. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

&#160; 

The balance of the Company&#8217;s frozen juice treats and desserts products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints.

The Company also provides repair and maintenance service to customers for customers&#8217; owned equipment and sells equipment in its Frozen Beverages segment, revenue from both totaled to 10% of sales in 2016, 9% in 2015 and 9% in 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Each new frozen carbonated customer location requires a frozen beverage dispenser supplied by the Company or by the customer. Company-supplied frozen carbonated dispensers are purchased from outside vendors, built new or rebuilt by the Company. 

&#160; 

The Company provides managed service and/or products to approximately 119,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers.

Other Products 

&#160;

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The Company sells its products to two principal channels: food service and retail supermarkets. The primary products sold to the food service channel are soft pretzels, frozen beverages, frozen juice treats and desserts, churros, dough enrobed handheld products and baked goods. The primary products sold to the retail supermarket channel are soft pretzels, frozen juice treats and desserts and dough enrobed handheld products. 

&#160; 

We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 42%, 43% and 43% of our sales during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with our largest customer accounting for 8% of our sales in 2016, 8% of our sales in 2015 and 8% of our sales in 2014. Three of the ten customers are food distributors who sell our product to many end users. The loss of one or more of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts and make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our operating income would be adversely impacted. 

&#160; 

The Food Service and the Frozen Beverages segments sell primarily to food service channels. The Retail Supermarkets segment sells primarily to the retail supermarket channel. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s customers in the food service segment include snack bars and food stands in chain, department and mass merchandising stores, malls and shopping centers, fast food outlets, casual dining restaurants, stadiums and sports arenas, leisure and theme parks, convenience stores, movie theatres, warehouse club stores, schools, colleges and other institutions, and independent retailers. Machines and machine parts are sold to other food and beverage companies. Within the food service industry, the Company&#8217;s products are purchased by the consumer primarily for consumption at the point-of-sale. 

&#160; 

The Company sells its products to an estimated 85-90% of supermarkets in the United States.

The Company&#8217;s products are shipped in refrigerated and other vehicles from the Company&#8217;s manufacturing and warehouse facilities on a fleet of Company operated tractor-trailers, trucks and vans, as well as by independent carriers. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s sales are seasonal because frozen beverage sales and frozen juice treats and desserts sales are generally higher during the warmer months. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Snack food and bakery products markets are highly competitive. The Company&#8217;s principal products compete against similar and different food products manufactured and sold by numerous other companies, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the Company. As the soft pretzel, frozen juice treat and dessert, bakery products and related markets evolve, additional competitors and new competing products may enter the markets. Competitive factors in these markets include product quality, customer service, taste, price, identity and brand name awareness, method of distribution and sales promotions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Company believes it is the only national distributor of soft pretzels. However, there are numerous regional and local manufacturers of food service and retail supermarket soft pretzels as well as several chains of retail pretzel stores. 

&#160; 

In Frozen Beverages the Company competes directly with other frozen beverage companies. These include several companies which have the right to use the ICEE name in portions of nine states. There are many other regional frozen beverage competitors throughout the country and one large retail chain which uses its own frozen beverage brand. 

&#160; 

The Company competes with large soft drink manufacturers for counter and floor space for its frozen beverage dispensing machines at retail locations and with products which are more widely known than the ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE frozen beverages. 

&#160; 

The Company competes with a number of other companies in the frozen juice treat and dessert and bakery products markets. 

&#160; 

Risks Associated with Foreign Operations 

&#160; 

Foreign operations generally involve greater risk than doing business in the United States. Foreign economies differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States&#8217; economy in such respects as the level of inflation and debt, which may result in fluctuations in the value of the country&#8217;s currency and real property. Sales of our foreign operations were $27,075,000, $25,313,000 and $23,633,000 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At September 24, 2016, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $29 million or 3.7% of total assets. At September 26, 2015, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $28 million or 3.8% of total assets. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company has about 3,600 full and part time employees and approximately 1,500 workers employed by staffing agencies as of September 24, 2016. About 1,000 production and distribution employees throughout the Company are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

&#160; 

The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
