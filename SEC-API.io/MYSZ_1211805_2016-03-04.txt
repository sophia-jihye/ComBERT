 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General Background and Description of the Company 

&#160; 

My Size Inc. (hereinafter: the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated and commenced operations in September 1999 as Topspin Medical, Inc., (&#8220;Topspin&#8221;) a private company registered in the State of Delaware, United States. Topspin was engaged in research and development of a medical magnetic resonance imaging (&#8220;MRI&#8221;) technology for interventional cardiology and in the development of MRI technology for use in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. 

&#160; 

On September 1, 2005, the Company issued securities to the public in Israel according to a prospectus and became publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (&#8220;TASE&#8221;). In 2007, and until August 2012, the Company registered some of its securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#34;SEC&#34;). The Company's shares are traded only in Israel in NIS. 

&#160; 

In January 2012, after having received the approval of the general meeting of shareholders of the company, the company consummated a transaction whereby it acquired Metamorefix Ltd. Pursuant to such transaction Metamorefix became wholly owned by the company (through Topspin Israel). Metamorefix Ltd. was incorporated in 2007, and is engaged in the development of innovative solutions with high practicable potential for the rehabilitation of tissues, particularly skin tissues. 

&#160; 

On August 21, 2012, the Company&#8217;s board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), approved the suspension of the Company&#8217;s reporting obligations under Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (the &#8220;Deregistration&#8221;). The Company thereafter filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on September 5, 2012 to effect the Deregistration. Upon the filing of the Form 15, the Company&#8217;s obligation to file periodic and current reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, was immediately suspended. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the Company changed its name to Knowledgetree Ventures Inc. On February 16, 2014 the Company changed its name to My Size Inc. In January, 2014, the Board approved a transaction with Shoshana Zigdon, a related party, concerning the entering into a technology venture through a new subsidiary which will be incorporated for this purpose, as discussed below. In the past, the Company engaged through its Israeli subsidiary, in the development of products in the fields of cardiology and urology. By the end of 2012, in view of the Company&#8217;s cash flow, the Company&#8217;s ceased its above operations and shortly thereafter the Company&#8217;s employees were laid off and in January 2013 the Company sold its entire shares in Metamorfix. 

&#160; 

Transaction Involving Change in Control 

&#160; 

In September 2013 Ronen Luzon, the Company&#8217;s CEO, purchased control of the Company from Mr. Asher Shmuelevitch. Mr. Ronen Luzon purchased 1,755,950 shares from Mr. Asher Shmuelevitch which represented approx. 40% of the issued and outstanding share capital at such time and thus became a controlling shareholder (the &#34;Transaction&#34;). 

&#160; 

Within the framework of the Transaction Mr. Ronen Luzon undertook to act to reach a settlement with the Company's creditors, according to which the Company will pay the main creditor, Mr. Asher Shmuelevitch, a total sum of NIS 0.5 million, in consideration for a full and final waiver of any and all his claims that he may have in connection with any monetary indebtedness of the Company to them. 

&#160; 

As a result of the various investment rounds in the Company (as detailed in item 5 below) Mr. Ronen Luzon's holding in the Company was diluted and currently represents 12% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

MySize is a technology company whose strategy is based on the development of applications that can be utilized to accurately take measurements of a variety of items via a smartphone. By simply downloading the application to one&#8217;s smartphone, the user is then able to simply run the smartphone over the surface of the item the user wishes to measure. The information is then automatically sent to a cloud based server where the dimensions are calculated through the company&#8217;s proprietary algorithms and the accurate measurements (+ or - .78 of an inch) are then sent back to the users smartphone. The entire process takes mere seconds to complete. The commercial applications for this technology are significant in many areas. 

&#160; 

Currently, MySize is focusing on the following business verticals: 

&#160; 

&#9679; E-commerce Apparel Industry &#8211; main market &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Courier Services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Do It Yourself (DIY) uses &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Usage as a tape measure &#160; 

Currently, MySize is devoting much of its focus on the applications for the apparel business. The company also believes that all of the above mentioned applications will be useful to users, retailers and vendors alike. 

&#160; 

The Apparel Industry 

&#160; 

MySize is in development of an application which assists the consumer to accurately take the measurements of his or her own body in order to fit clothing in the best way possible without the need to try them on using a smartphone. The purpose of MySize is to simplify the process of clothing acquisition through the internet and to significantly reduce the rate of returns of clothing which were acquired through the internet and which are returned to the stores as a result of ill-fitting.

&#160; 

MySize operates based on the use of existing sensors in smart phones which enable, through a specific purpose application, to measure the body of each consumer independently by moving the cellular phone along his or her body. The measurements will then be saved on the Company's cloud database, enabling the user to search for clothes in various retailer websites without worrying about size. When a search is made, the retailer connects to the Company's cloud and only provides results based on the user's measurements and other parameters as he may have defined. This data will also be saved for when a customer enters a brick and mortar store to help serve the customer more efficiently and to better the shopping experience. 

&#160; 

As soon as the item is found and the acquisition is completed, the retailer will be charged a certain percentage of the acquisition price. The rate to be charged of the entire acquisition has not been fixed at this stage and will be determined following negotiations with fashion companies, in a more advanced stage of the development. 

&#160; 

A B2B pilot was launched in 2015 with a Spanish apparel e-tailor Trucco. It was agreed that in March 2016, Trucco will select a focus group to test the MySizeID app and provide feedback on the efficacy of the technology. The next milestones will be decided after the results of the Focus Group. 

&#160;

The company is already in advanced discussions with additional major online apparel players to integrate the MySizeID solution. 

&#160; 

How MySize Apparel Can be Utilized 

&#160; 

1. My Size ID: This app lets consumers create a secure, online profile of their personal measurements, which can then be utilized with partnered online retailers to insure that no matter the manufacturer or size chart, they will always get the right fit. The MySizeID App utilizes a patent-pending measurement technology that does not rely on user photographs nor any additional hardware; all you need to do is scan your body with your smartphone and the app records your measurements. &#160; &#160; 2. In Store Shopping Tool: Users of MySize can allow brick and mortar merchants to access their profile to receive more personalized attention. This concierge like service enables the salesperson to better serve customers by accessing a user's size and style preferences to make the in-store shopping experience more pleasant, time efficient and satisfactory. &#160; &#160; 3. Cross Site Search Feature: The MySizeID Profile will enable users to search for a specific product or item across multiple online retailers, but unlike most shopping comparison shopping tools, MySizeID delivers results that fit each individual user&#8217;s measurements. This feature can be customized for personalized filters that go beyond sizing and measurements, and can also include a user's favorite colors, brands, styles and more. &#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s assumed profitability is based on these factors: 

&#160; 

1. The internet acquisition market does not exhaust its growth potential since the consumers are reluctant to order clothes which they have not seen or tried on and which may not fit them. &#160; &#160; 2. In the US the cost of return of clothes which were purchased on the internet, if the customer wishes to return them, is usually borne by the selling company. Consequently, high costs are incurred by the selling companies which increase their motivation to find a solution which would reduce such costs. &#160; &#160; 3. MySize does not currently hold any patents, the Venture, is in its advanced development stages, and is in the application and/or review process of 4 patent registrations, none of which have been granted at this time. &#160; 

MySize aims to cut the amount of returns by providing an application that calculates the exact body measurement proportions and determines the appropriate sized item to order, decreasing the amount of wrongly sized ordered items. Retailers are searching for ways to encourage shoppers to return less. MySize Inc. offers an easy to use mobile technology that solves this problem. 

&#160; 

INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP IN SPAIN: 

&#160; 

MySize signed an agreement with In Situ A. Trucco, a leading Spanish fashion company, to conduct a pilot utilizing MySize&#8217;s unique measuring and ID technology. It will be available for Trucco's online and off line customers to enable a more effective online shopping experience and the customization of clothing articles to their measures. Trucco maintains more than 240 shops in about 20 countries in Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South America, Middle East and Israel. 

&#160; 

The planned milestones for the In Situ A. Trocco project are detailed below. (due to the delay in the integration with Trucco we have accelerated several other processes that were planned for later stages and hence have been completed to date): 

&#160; 

Login and Account creation (Servers connection and API implementation) &#8211; completed 

&#160;

1. Focus group of 100 subjects with their detailed body measurements &#8211; completed &#160;

2. Database Migration &#8211; completed &#160;

3. Design of Web Widget &#8211; completed &#160;

4. Embedding it on Trucco web site &#8211; This was already completed. &#160;

5. Design of user review and package acceptance &#8211; this is stage has been decided to be placed on hold. &#160;

6. Design of Push Notifications - completed and approved by Trucco. &#160;

7. Final integration (client, MySize and Trucco servers) &#8211; Scheduled for Q2 2016 &#160; 

In Situ A. Trucco is a &#8220;white label&#8221; retailer, where all the products will be under its name using our technology. The scenario of using the MySize product with Trucco will go through the following stages. 

&#160; 

Stage 1 &#8211; Trucco consumers will create their profile using our web service or through our mobile app by measuring different body parts. 

&#160;

Stage 2 &#8211; after creating their profile the users will be able to log into Trucco online shop using their Trucco ID (received after creating their profile) and selecting the type of garment they would like to buy. 

&#160;

Stage 3 &#8211; Trucco servers will retrieve the user information from MySize servers and filter out only the items that matches the users size .

&#160;

Stage 4 &#8211; the users will select the garments he likes and go through checkout. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s success is significantly dependent upon the ongoing relationship with In Situ A. Trocco, and the achievement of the milestones for the project.

Courier Services 

&#160; 

When an individual wishes to ship boxes from place to place, they often call a courier service. Currently, individuals will contact a courier service and request a pick up. The individual is then usually asked the dimensions of the package to be shipped. Unfortunately, the response given to the courier can be rather vague (big, medium small etc.). This is often the cause of much confusion between the individual shipper and the courier. This confusion can lead to the courier sending out the wrong vehicle for the pick up and/or a large price differential than what was originally quoted by the courier causing customer dissatisfaction. 

&#160; 

How MySize Can be Utilized for Courier Services 

&#160; 

MySize operates based on the use of existing sensors in smart phones which enable, through a specific purpose application, to measure the dimensions of each package by moving the cellular phone along package (length, height and width) to be sent via courier. The measurements will then be saved on the Company's cloud database, and shared with the courier. This will allow for: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Courier services to provide accurate pricing to their consumers with little to no confusion. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Courier services can send the proper sized vehicle to pick up package(s). &#160;

The courier service market in the United States alone had revenues of over $90 billion in 2014 (http:// marketrealist.com/2015/07/look-courier-service-industry-united-states/). Consequently, the company views this as an excellent opportunity to create value in the courier market. 

&#160; 

Agreement with Katz Delivery Services, LTD 

&#160; 

On November 20,2015, MySize entered into an agreement with Katz Deliveries, LTD, one of the largest courier services in Israel. Katz Delivery Services delivers about five million parcels per year (the largest in Israel). The company employs more than 500 employees. The company has more than 250 vehicles. In this agreement, both parties have agreed to mutually work together to develop and integrate MySize technology with those of Katz&#8217;s Delivery Service. Currently, the company expects to have the application ready for use sometime in the second quarter of 2016. MySize hopes to begin to see revenues from this endeavor by the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Still in Development 

&#160; 

MySize is working on additional consumer applications. One of these applications is in the category of &#8220;Do It Yourself &#8220; (DIY). In this application, users will be able to visualize how an object or a piece of furniture will fit in an existing room in their home or office. As many people have difficulty with spatial recognition, the company hopes this will help alleviate the problem. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in Q3 2015, My Size launched the SizeUp app, a smart tape measure for the B2C market. SizeUp is another project that MySize has already completed and launched. This application allows users to utilize their smartphone as a tape measure. The application provides measurements with an accuracy +_- 2 cm. The current application is currently free. Initially available only for iOS, The app has garnered over 70K downloads through January, 2016. 

&#160; 

The first version for Android will measure horizontal distances and 2 nd version for iOS will include vertical measurements as well. Both of these improvements, are undergoing final QA stages. The company expects both apps will be published in app store (iOS) and Play Store (Android) on or about March 16.

The Market 

Clothing retailers have gained substantial growth in revenues by offering consumers an online platform to perform their shopping. MySize intends to market our product globally. We think that the statistics regarding the US are reflecting the world trend. The Company believes that the US will continue to have the largest scope of electronic commerce for a single country, and will be followed by the following countries in a large scope of sales: China, England, Japan and Germany. Apparel sales in the U.S. totaled $361.3 billion in 2013, with 15% of that being from online sales, approximately $54.2 billion in online sales 1 . Over the next 4 years, this percent of total sales is expected to increase to about 20% 2 .

&#160;

As online shopping becomes easier and more secure, global e-commerce sales are projected to grow at a cumulative annual growth rate of 14.6% through 2017, to reach about USD 2 trillion, as illustrated below.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

&#160; 

Additionally, mobile ecommerce is expected to total 25% of the total ecommerce market by 2017, as the chart demonstrates below. As Smartphones become more common and sophisticated, consumers will be able to shop wherever they are, strengthening the ecommerce market.

Income Sources - Projected Income 

&#160; 

The Company sees four methods of producing revenue through its product: 

&#160; 

1. Fees - The Company will charge sellers with a fee for every garment and clothing item purchased using its services. 1-3% of royalties on product sales, depending on volume, resulting from usage of the MySizeID platform &#160; 

2. Advertisements - the Company may generate revenue by using specialized ads using its database to identify the user's exact needs. &#160; 

3. Second Hand Goods - the Company may offer its services for private sellers of garments and clothing, such as through &#34;ebay&#34; and the like. In this case, the seller will pay a fee if the purchase was made using the Company's application. &#160; 

4. &#34;Offline Shopping&#34; - the Company may offer its services for clothing and fashion stores, for real-time use by their customers. The service may allow the store to immediately offer the customer a fitting garment suitable for his size. &#160; 

Plan of Operations 

&#160; 

MySize is not currently profitable and may not be able to achieve profitability in the future. 

&#160; 

Over the next 12 months MySize will remain committed to its current core business of developing products that going to change the way consumers buy clothes online and how consumers ship products via courier services and developing of SizeUp application a tape measurement for your smartphone. 

&#160; 

In addition the Company will continue to develop a number of complimentary products. 

&#160; 

On the 26th of April 2015 the Company finished development of the measurement algorithm on 2D horizontal surface that enables to measure the distance the mobile phone is traveling without the use of any external sensors. The Company plans to patent this algorithm, but its patent has not been granted at this time. In the Company&#8217;s Israeli patent application filed on 02/02/2015 ( A System For and a Method of Measuring a Path Length Using a Handheld Electronic Device -(061917)), the term path is defined as follows: 

&#160; 

The term path may refer to a linear path i.e. a path extending substantially along one path line. The path/path line may be supported by a supporting surface of an object. For example, the path may be supported by a body part or a plane surface. 

&#160; 

On 18 of February the company reported on a technological breakthrough that will allow for measurements to be taken using a Smartphone &#8220;in the air&#8221;, without having to pass the phone directly over the surface, this ability very important for measuring a box (which is not always a straight surface) or a long wall. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase 1 - Define requirements and priorities according to the retailers need - This includes defining all the requirements of the different products &#8211; User profile , Database, measurement wizard, My Size cloud Engine, applications , platforms, search engine and in store shopping tool. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 - Pre Design Review (PDR) - The purpose of the PDR is to ensure that all top level performance requirements for designs, systems and structures are complete and adequate. Another area to be addressed is if there are any alternate solutions that must be studied given the defined requirements.

Competition 

&#160;

MySzieID's solution is win-win solution for consumers and retailers. The Company's innovative technology is protected by 2 patent-pending submissions, with a third patent application in process. MySize's products allow users to measure themselves simply by sliding a smartphone over their body, and the measurements are recorded by the MySize App. 

&#160; 

Unlike other products claiming similar capabilities, there is no need for additional accessories (no webcam, photos, or measuring tape etc.). Users of the MySize app and their information are protected and a unique id number is provided that matches personal sizes with retailer size charts. When consumers get the right size products, retailers get fewer returns. 

&#160; 

My Size offers a unique, easy to use product that automatically and accurately determines your clothing size. MySize utilizes a patent-pending measurement technology combined with sophisticated algorithms that does not rely on user photographs nor any additional hardware; all you need in order to buy your perfect size is your smartphone. 

&#160; 

My Size's advantage lies in its easy to use application in recording body measurements. Using special algorithmic equations, the software is able to determine which sizes will best fit the customer. The collection of this data, and tracking shoppers' preferences, allows for a unique shopping experience both online and in brick and mortar stores where the technology can instantly match clothes the customer likes in sizes that will fit them. 

&#160; 

As mentioned, 15% of apparel sales are done online. This is lower than other consumer goods such as media &#38; sporting items, electronics, and furniture. The likely reason for this is that people want to try on clothes before buying them. My Size believes its technology will reduce customer apprehensiveness by telling the customer what will fit when searching online for clothes. 

&#160; 

However, My Size does face competition in helping retailers increase conversation rate and reduce shipping costs.

Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well established in markets in which we have existing retailers or intend to locate new retailers. We may also need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new retail formats or concepts that develop from time to time, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that modifications to our concepts will not reduce our profitability.
