General Development of the Business 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160;

FutureFuel Corp. (sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our,&#8221; and includes our wholly owned subsidiaries) is a Delaware corporation. 

&#160; 

Prior to 2011, our shares of common stock were quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (or OTC Bulletin Board). On March 8, 2011, the New York Stock Exchange (or &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) approved the listing of our common stock for trading on the exchange. Trading of our common stock on the NYSE commenced on March 23, 2011 under the symbol &#8220;FF&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We distributed normal quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on our common stock for the calendar year 2015. Additionally, we have declared normal quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on our common stock for the calendar year 2016. 

&#160; 

FutureFuel Chemical Company 

&#160; 

FutureFuel Chemical Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of FutureFuel Corp., is a Delaware corporation and manufactures diversified chemical products, bio-based products comprised of biofuels, and bio-based specialty chemical products. We report FutureFuel Chemical Company&#8217;s operations in two reporting segments: chemicals and biofuels. The chemicals segment manufactures a diversified listing of chemical products that are sold to third party customers. The biofuels segment primarily produces and sells biodiesel to its customers. 

&#160; 

The majority of the revenues from the chemicals segment are derived from the custom manufacturing of specialty chemicals for specific customers. We have actively worked to develop our chemicals business with new customers in more diversified growth markets. 

&#160; 

Growth of our specialty chemicals business is based on a solid reputation as a technology-driven, highly reliable, and globally competitive specialty chemicals producer. We retain a strong emphasis on operational excellence, cost control, and efficiency improvements to enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities in the worldwide chemical industry. 

&#160;

With respect to our biofuels segment, our plant has a demonstrated capacity in excess of 58 million gallons per year. The plant ran at a reduced rate during 2015 as a result of the weakened market conditions for renewable fuel. Future production of biodiesel is uncertain and will depend on various factors including: (i) changes in feedstock prices relative to biodiesel prices; (ii) whether government mandates with respect to biodiesel usage remain in effect; (iii) whether certain tax credits with respect to biodiesel production remain in effect; and (iv) competitiveness and availability of foreign imports. See the discussion below, including &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; beginning at page 15 below.

Narrative Description of Our Business 

&#160; 

Principal Executive Offices 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 8235 Forsyth Blvd., 4 th Floor, Clayton, Missouri 63105. Our telephone number is (314) 854-8385. FutureFuel Chemical Company&#8217;s principal executive offices are located at 2800 Gap Road, Highway 394 South, Batesville, Arkansas 72501-9680. Its telephone number is (870) 698-3000. 

&#160; 

Plant Location 

&#160; 

We own approximately 2,200 acres of land six miles southeast of Batesville in north central Arkansas fronting the White River. Approximately 500 acres of the site are occupied with batch and continuous manufacturing facilities, laboratories, and associated infrastructure, including on-site liquid waste treatment. Land and infrastructure are available to support expansion and business growth. In November 2011, we acquired a nearby warehouse in Batesville, Arkansas. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; &#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 58% of our revenue was derived from biofuels, 36% from manufacturing specialty chemicals for specific customers (&#8220;custom manufacturing&#8221;), and 6% of revenues from multi-customer specialty chemicals (&#8220;performance chemicals&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our biofuels business segment primarily involves the production and sale of biodiesel and petrodiesel blends and the buying, selling, and shipping of refined petroleum products on common carrier pipelines. Custom chemicals manufacturing involves producing unique products for strategic customers, generally under long-term contracts. Our custom chemicals manufacturing product portfolio includes agrochemicals and intermediates, detergent additives, biocides intermediates, specialty polymers, dyes, stabilizers, and chemicals intermediates. Our performance chemicals product portfolio includes polymer modifiers that enhance stain resistance and dye-ability to nylon and polyester fibers, in addition to several small-volume specialty chemicals and solvents for diverse applications. 

&#160; 

We are committed to growing our biofuels and chemical businesses. For the biofuels business segment, we will continue to leverage our technical capabilities and quality certifications, secure local and regional markets, and expand marketing efforts to fleets and regional/national customers. For our chemicals segment, we intend to pursue commercialization of other products, including building block chemicals. While pursuing this strategy, we will continue our efforts to establish a name identity for both segments. 

&#160;

Biofuels Business Segment 

&#160; 

&#160;

Biofuel Products 

&#160; 

Our biofuels business segment began in 2005 and primarily produces and sells biodiesel. In addition, we sell petrodiesel in blends with our biodiesel and, from time to time, with no biodiesel added. Our biofuels segment also includes the financial results of a granary in central Arkansas that we acquired in March 2009. Finally, we are a shipper of refined petroleum products on common carrier pipelines, and we buy and sell petroleum products to maintain our active shipper status on these pipelines. 

&#160; 

Biodiesel is a renewable energy product consisting of mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids. The mono-alkyl esters are typically produced from vegetable oil, fat, or grease feedstocks. Biodiesel is used primarily as a blend with petrodiesel (usually 5% (commonly referenced as &#8220;B5&#8221;) to 20% (commonly referenced as &#8220;B20&#8221;) by volume). A major advantage of biodiesel is that it can be used in most existing diesel engines and fuel injection equipment in blends up to B20 with no material impact to engine performance. As an additional benefit, biodiesel is the only alternative fuel to meet all testing requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 1998, Congress approved the use of biodiesel as an Energy Policy Act compliance strategy, which allowed federal, state, and public fleets covered by this Act to meet their alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements by simply buying biodiesel and burning it in new or existing diesel vehicles in a minimum B20 blend). Finally, biodiesel also benefits from favorable properties compared to petrodiesel (e.g., negligible sulfur content, lower particulate matter, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a higher cetane number leading to better engine performance and lubrication). See Pew Center on Global Climate Change (&#8220;Pew Center&#8221;) biodiesel factsheet http://www.c2es.org/technology/factsheet/biodiesel and July 2011 Biodiesel Climate Techbook, http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/Biodiesel_0.pdf. 

&#160; 

Our technical and operational competency acquired as a supplier of specialty chemicals enabled the development of a flexible manufacturing process which can utilize a broad range of feedstock oils, including, but not limited to, soy oil, cottonseed oil, pork lard, poultry fat, crude corn oil, yellow grease, inedible tallow, choice white grease, and beef tallow. Our Batesville plant produces biodiesel, which is sometimes referenced as &#8220;B100.&#8221; A blend is currently used in the facility&#8217;s diesel fleet and is available for retail sale at the site. In 2009, we began offering B100, biodiesel blended with petrodiesel (B2, B5, B10, and B20 blends), and petrodiesel at our leased storage facility in Little Rock, Arkansas. In addition, we deliver blended product to a small group of customers within our region. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Biodiesel Production/Capacity 

&#160; 

While biodiesel can be made from various renewable sources, the choice of feedstock to be used at any particular facility is determined primarily by the price and availability of each feedstock variety, the yield loss of lower quality feedstock, and the capabilities of the producer&#8217;s biodiesel production facility. In addition, the chemical properties of the biodiesel (e.g., cloud point, pour point, and cetane number) depend on the type of feedstock. EIA, Monthly Biodiesel Production Report, http://www.eia.gov/biofuels/biodiesel/production. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the majority of biodiesel historically has been made from domestically produced crude soybean oil due to its relatively low price. See ibid. Since we started our biodiesel production, the cost of crude soybean oil has increased due in part to its use in biodiesel production and competing food demands. As a result, the biodiesel feedstock market in the United States is in a transition from this increasingly expensive first-generation soy feedstock to alternative second-generation lower-cost, non-food feedstocks such as waste vegetable oil, tallow, and algae. See http://www.emerging-markets.com/biodiesel/index.html. Accordingly, we redesigned our continuous line to produce biodiesel from these second-generation lower-cost feedstocks with high-free fatty acids. From the redesigned line, the plant has demonstrated a production capacity in excess of 58 million gallons of biodiesel per year. 

&#160; 

Legislative Incentives 

&#160; 

The acceptance of biodiesel in the United States in the latter part of the 20 th century and continuing into this century has been driven to a great degree by legislative initiatives at both the federal and state levels. 

&#160; 

Federal Renewable Fuels Mandate 

&#160; 

The largest incentive at this time is the federal mandate enacted by Congress as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the &#8220;2005 Act&#8221;). The 2005 Act included a number of provisions intended to spur the production and use of biodiesel. In particular, the 2005 Act&#8217;s provisions included biodiesel as part of the minimum volume (i.e., a mandate) of renewable fuels (the &#8220;renewable fuels standard&#8221; or &#8220;RFS&#8221;) to be included in the nationwide gasoline and diesel pool. More specifically, the RFS requires a specific amount of renewable fuel to be used each year in the nationwide gasoline and diesel pool. The volume increased each year, from 4 billion gallons per year in 2006 to 16.55 billion gallons per year in 2013. The 2005 Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;USEPA&#8221;) to publish &#8220;renewable fuel obligations&#8221; applicable to refiners, blenders, and importers in the contiguous 48 states. The renewable fuel obligations are expressed in terms of a volume percentage of gasoline sold or introduced into commerce and consist of a single applicable percentage that applies to all categories of refiners, blenders, and importers. The renewable fuel obligations are based on estimates that the Energy Information Association provides to the USEPA on the volumes of gasoline it expects will be sold or introduced into commerce. The USEPA released the final rules to implement the RFS on April 10, 2007. Under those rules, the RFS compliance period began on September 1, 2007. No differentiation was made among the various types of renewable fuels (e.g., biodiesel or ethanol). 

&#160; 

On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the &#8220;2007 Act&#8221;) was enacted which, among other things, expanded the RFS (the &#8220;RFS2&#8221;). Prior to the enactment of the 2007 Act, the RFS requirement was mostly filled by ethanol. In contrast to its predecessor, the 2007 Act provided a renewable fuel standard carve-out specifically applicable to biodiesel. On July 1, 2010, RFS2&#8217;s biodiesel requirement became effective, thus requiring that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biodiesel mandate rose annually and reached 1.28 billion gallons per year in 2013. Currently, the mandate is determined by the USEPA in coordination with the U.S. Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture. On November 30, 2015, the USEPA finalized the volume requirements and percentage standards under the RFS2 program for 2014, 2015, and 2016 for cellulosic biofuel, biomass based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel. 

&#160; 

The USEPA also finalized the volume requirement for biomass-based diesel in 2017. Biodiesel standards grew steadily over the next two years increasing to 2 billion gallons by 2017 as shown in the following table.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

U.S. biomass-based diesel production, of which biodiesel represents a significant amount, exceeded the federal mandate from 2011 through 2015 as shown in the following chart: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Federal Blenders&#8217; and Producers&#8217; Credits 

&#160; 

Biodiesel tax incentives have been provided through various federal statutes, including the 2005 Act and the American Jobs Creation Act, and later, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The most important of these is the one dollar per gallon blenders&#8217; tax credit (&#8220;BTC&#8221;) applicable to all biodiesel. Although this credit has lapsed and been reinstated numerous times over the last decade, in late 2015 the BTC was reinstated retroactively to January 1, 2015 and will remain in place through at least December 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

We also benefit from a &#8220;small&#8221; agri-biodiesel producers&#8217; tax credit for production in capacity not in excess 60 million gallons per year. This credit of $0.10 per gallon applies to the first 15 million gallons of agri-biodiesel sold. See https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8864.pdf . Like the BTC, the small agri-biodiesel credit is currently effective and will remain in place through December 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

Other Federal Incentives 

&#160; 

Agencies of the United States government, including the Department of Energy, the USEPA, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Transportation, offer biodiesel incentives in addition to the mandate discussed above. Some of these federal incentives do not directly reduce the net cost of producing or blending biodiesel but do increase the demand for biodiesel. For example, tax credits are available under the Internal Revenue Code for investment in qualifying refueling property, the USEPA will pay 50-100% of the cost for schools to upgrade and/or replace their buses, and programs administered by the Department of Energy indirectly require government fleet operators to purchase substantial amounts of biodiesel. 

&#160; 

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires government fleet operators to use a certain percentage of alternatively fueled vehicles. The Act established a goal of replacing 10% of motor fuels with non-petroleum alternatives by 2000, increasing to 30% by the year 2010. Currently, 75% of all new light-duty federal vehicles purchased are required to have alternative fuel capability to set an example for the private automotive and fuel industries. 

&#160; 

Under the Energy Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1998, vehicle fleets that are required to purchase alternatively fueled vehicles can generate credit toward this requirement by purchasing and using biodiesel in a conventional vehicle. Since there are few cost-effective options for purchasing heavy-duty alternatively fueled vehicles, federal and state fleet providers can meet up to 50% of their heavy-duty alternatively fueled vehicle purchase requirements with biodiesel. The biodiesel fuel credit allows fleets to purchase and use 450 gallons of biodiesel in vehicles in excess of 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight instead of alternatively fueled vehicles. Fleets must purchase and use the equivalent of 450 gallons of pure biodiesel in a minimum of a 20% blend to earn one credit. Covered fleets earn one vehicle credit for every light-duty alternatively fueled vehicle they acquire annually beyond their base vehicle acquisition requirements. Credits can be banked or sold. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The federal government offers other programs that benefit our biofuels segment, such as the alternative fuel infrastructure credit, the clean school bus program, and the national clean diesel program. 

&#160; 

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was enacted which, among other things, appropriated monies to support various investments and offered incentives (such as tax credits, grant programs, and other funding) for projects related to alternative fuels, energy independence, and renewable energy technologies. For example, the Department of Energy was provided with $800 million for projects related to biomass, and $2 billion was made available for grants for manufacturing advanced battery systems and electric vehicle components to support domestic manufacturing of advanced lithium ion batteries and hybrid electric systems. We were the recipient of a portion of these grants. See the discussion under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. - Department of Energy Grant&#8221; beginning at page 40 below. 

&#160; 

State Incentives 

&#160; 

Many states follow the federal government&#8217;s lead and are offering similar programs and incentives to spur biodiesel production and use. For example, Arkansas offers a tax refund of $0.50 for each gallon of biodiesel used by a supplier to produce a biodiesel/petrodiesel mixture of not more than 2% biodiesel. In April 2007, Arkansas passed legislation that provided for a $0.20 per gallon biodiesel producer credit and up to $50 in grants per site for biodiesel producers and distributors to install distribution infrastructure. The $0.20 per gallon Arkansas producer credit was capped at 10 million gallons of production, or $2 million, per defined time intervals. We applied for, and received, the credit for time intervals through June 30, 2009. No funding was available for this program in 2010 through 2015. However, we intend to apply for the credit in future years when and as such credit is available. 

&#160; 

Our review of state statutes reveals that virtually all states provide user or producer incentives for biodiesel, several states provide both types of incentives, and more than 35 states provide incentives to biodiesel producers to build facilities in their states, typically offering tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives. As we expand our business, we will evaluate these additional state incentives to determine if we qualify. 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

We will continue to identify and pursue other legislative incentives to support our business. However, no assurances can be given that we will qualify for any such incentives or, if we do qualify, what the amount of such incentives will be or whether such incentives will continue to be available. 

&#160; 

Quality 

&#160; 

For quality specification purposes, and to qualify for the federal mandate, biodiesel must meet the requirements of American Society for Testing and Materials (&#8220;ASTM&#8221;) D6751. This specification ensures that blends up to B20 are compatible with diesel engines and associated fuel system hardware. See Status and Issues for Biodiesel in the United States , National Renewable Energy Laboratory, R.L. McCormick et. al., Oct. 2009. All biodiesel manufactured at our Batesville plant is tested in on-site quality control laboratories and confirmed to meet, and typically exceed, the ASTM D6751 standard. Because our biodiesel exceeds industry standard specifications, we appeal to a broader customer base than our competitors. 

&#160; 

Commercially available biodiesels can contain small amounts of unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats as well as other minor impurities. The unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats are called glycerides. In rare instances the glycerides and other minor components and impurities can clog engine filters. To address this issue, ASTM D6751 was amended in February 2012 to create two new grades of biodiesel. Grade No. 2 is essentially the specifications in effect before the amendment. Grade No. 1 provides for a maximum total monoglyceride content and a maximum cold soak filterability time and in theory would be used where the No. 2 biodiesel does not operate down to its cloud point. Both grades of biodiesel qualify as &#8220;biodiesel&#8221; for purposes of the RFS2 mandate. FutureFuel continues to operate under the most recently published version of ASTM D6751, Standard Specifications for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock (B100) for Middle Distillate Fuels. All biodiesel made in our continuous process meets the specifications for No. 1 biodiesel. 

&#160; 

The U.S. biodiesel industry created the BQ-9000 program to address quality issues that arose during the early years of the industry. This program is run by the National Biodiesel Accreditation Committee, which is a cooperative and voluntary program for the accreditation of biodiesel producers and marketers. The program is a quality system oriented program that includes standards for storage, sampling, testing, blending, shipping, distribution, and fuel management practices. Since the creation and adoption of the BQ-9000 program, the quality of biodiesel in the U.S. market has markedly improved. Our plant has operated as a BQ-9000 accredited production facility since 2006. 

&#160; 

The ISO 9000 family of standards represents an international consensus on good quality management practices. It consists of standards and guidelines relating to quality management systems and related supporting standards. ISO 9001 provides a set of standardized requirements for a quality management system, regardless of what the user organization does, its size, or whether it is in the private or public sector. It is the only international standard against which organizations can be certified, although certification is not a compulsory requirement of the standard. Our plant is an ISO 9001 accredited production facility for both chemicals and biofuels. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Renewable Identification Numbers 

&#160; 

As noted above, the RFS2 mandates levels of various types of renewable fuels that are to be blended with U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel by U.S. refiners, blenders, and importers. Renewable Identification Numbers (&#8220;RINs&#8221;) are the mechanism for ensuring that the prescribed levels of blending are reached. As ethanol and biodiesel is produced or imported, the producer or importer has the responsibility to report the activity in the USEPA&#8217;s Moderated Transaction System (&#8220;EMTS&#8221;) where a series of numbers (i.e., a RIN) is assigned to their product. Assignment is made according to guidelines established by the USEPA. Currently, 1&#189; RINs are assigned for each gallon of biodiesel produced. When biofuels change ownership to the refiners, importers, and blenders of the fuel, the RINs are also transferred. The RINs ultimately are separated from the renewable fuel generally at the time the renewable fuel is blended. The refiners, importers, and blenders generally use the RINs to establish that they have blended their applicable percentage of renewable fuels during the applicable reporting period. However, once the RINs are separated from the underlying biofuels (e.g., by blending the underlying biodiesel with petrodiesel), they can also be sold separate and apart from the underlying biofuel. 

&#160; 

We generate RINs with our biodiesel. At times, we sell biodiesel with the RIN attached to the fuel. If we blend the biodiesel with petrodiesel in blends of B80 or less (e.g., B5 or B20), we can either sell the RINs with our blended biodiesel or we can sell them as a separate, free-standing instrument removed from the biodiesel. The decision of whether or not to separate the RINs from the blended biodiesel depends on the desires of the customer and market conditions for separated RINs, particularly, market prices. While biodiesel RINs continue to be traded through market makers, no assurances can be given that a separate market for RINs will be sustained or what value will be realized upon the sale of biodiesel RINs. 

&#160; 

The USEPA issued a proposed rule on February 21, 2013 to establish a voluntary Quality Assurance Program (&#8220;QAP&#8221;) to verify the validity of renewable identification numbers under the RFS Program. We voluntarily registered in the program as a QAP B participant in 2013. On July 18, 2014, the USEPA issued the final rule. All of our 2013, 2014, and 2015 RINs were verified in accordance with the final rule. See https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-07-18/pdf/2014-16487.pdf . 

&#160; 

Byproducts 

&#160; 

Glycerin 

&#160; 

A byproduct of the biodiesel process is crude glycerin, which is produced at the rate of approximately 10% by mass of the quantity of biodiesel produced. Increased production of biodiesel in Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, and Malaysia resulted in excess glycerin being produced by the biodiesel industry in 2015. See http://www.icis.com/resources/news/2015/12/31/9952515/outlook-16-us-glycerine-market-faces-long-supply/. Crude glycerin as generated from biodiesel production is commonly sold into the feed market for limited value, the price of which is determined by supply and corn commodity prices. 

&#160; 

Biodiesel producers may sell their crude glycerin to large refineries for upgrading. Because of the influx of crude glycerin into the market from biodiesel producers, producers currently are receiving only minimal value for this byproduct. Crude glycerin can be refined into a pure form and then used in higher value markets such as specialty chemical production, agricultural chemistry, food, pharmaceutical, and/or cosmetic applications. In 2014, we added the capability to refine our crude glycerin to an industrial grade with higher value applications. We currently market both crude and industrial grade glycerin, with our product mix dependent upon refining capacity, product specifications, prices, and other market conditions. 

&#160; 

Biodiesel Residue 

&#160;

An additional byproduct of the biodiesel production process is biodiesel residue. We utilize distillation columns in our biodiesel production process. Biodiesel residue accumulates in these columns as biodiesel is produced. This is a low priced commodity that we aggregate and sell to multiple customers, primarily for use in Bunker C #6 oil and as an asphalt release agent. 

&#160; 

Biodiesel Production Capacity 

&#160; 

According to Biodiesel Magazine, as of December 8, 2015, there were 166 biodiesel plants in existence in the United States. These plants had a combined annual nameplate production capacity of 2,756.06 million gallons. See http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/plants/listplants/USA/. An additional 15 plants were under construction with a combined nameplate production capacity of 326.25 million gallons, for a total built-out capacity of 3,082.31 million gallons. See http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/plants/listplants/USA/construction/ . 

&#160; 

Because both current and anticipated biodiesel production capacities exceed the federal mandate, we believe that price competition and their biodiesel industry will continue to be highly competitive. 

&#160; 

The majority of biodiesel nameplate production capacity was built to use higher cost crude vegetable oil, usually soybean oil, as its only feedstock. Many of these plants are being consolidated and retrofitted to accommodate lower cost feedstocks. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Customers and Markets &#160; 

&#160; 

Biodiesel and biodiesel blends are currently used in nearly all of the end markets where petrodiesel is used. Most biodiesel in the United States is consumed in the on-road diesel fuel market, although some is used for off-road purposes such as farming, residential/commercial heating oil, and power generation. 

&#160; 

We currently market our biodiesel products by truck, rail, and barge directly to customers in the United States. Through the utilization of liquid bulk storage facilities and barge loading capabilities, we are positioned to market biodiesel throughout the United States for transportation and home heating fuel usage. Although the regional market is still being developed, we estimate that the regional direct market available to us at maturity will be at least 30 million gallons per year. 

&#160; 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, two of our customers represented approximately 57% and 52% of our biofuels revenues (33% and 30% of total revenues), respectively, with the remaining biofuels revenues spread across multiple other customers. We do not have a contract with either primary customer, but rather sell on the basis of monthly or short-term, multi-month purchase orders placed with us by this customer at prices based upon then-prevailing market rates. We do not believe that the loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that: (i) biofuels are a commodity with a large potential customer base; (ii) we believe that we could readily sell biofuels to other customers; (iii) the prices we receive from these customers are based upon then-market rates; and (iv) our sales to the customers are not under fixed terms and the customers have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short term purchase orders. 

&#160; 

In 2015, U.S. imports of biodiesel rose approximately 30% to an estimated 670 million gallons from 510 million gallons in 2014. As imports continue to take a larger share of the U.S. market, the U.S. biodiesel industry continues to lobby for a reformation of the BTC as a U.S. domestic production credit. Biodiesel Production Rises in 2015 as Consumers Seek Cleaner Fuels . The National Biodiesel Board. January 25, 2016. 

&#160; 

Competition &#160; 

&#160; 

We compete with other producers of biodiesel locally, regionally, nationally, and with foreign imports. The principal methods of competition in the biodiesel industry are price, supply reliability, biodiesel quality, and RIN integrity, i.e., the degree of confidence the market maintains in the validity of a biodiesel producer&#8217;s RINs. The largest producers in terms of production capacity of biodiesel in the United States in 2015 were Renewable Energy Group, Inc., RBF Port Neches LLC, Green Earth Fuels of Houston LLC, Louis Dreyfus Agricultural Industries LLC, Archer Daniels Midland Co. - Velva, Elevance Natchez Inc., Delta BioFuels Inc., FutureFuel Chemical Company, Ag Processing Inc., and Cincinnati Renewable Fuels LLC. See http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/plants/listplants/USA/. Additionally, we compete with numerous other smaller producers and evolving cellulosic based biodiesel technologies. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the emergence of significant new supplies of natural gas in the U.S., primarily as a result of shale gas development, has increased the awareness of natural gas as a key component of the domestic U.S. energy supply and has lowered natural gas prices. Natural gas use in the transportation sector is likely to increase. See http://mitei.mit.edu/publications/reports-studies/future-natural-gas. Increased usage of natural gas may lead to declines in the demand for petrodiesel and biodiesel. 

&#160; 

We cannot give any assurances that renewable diesel fuel, green diesel, natural gas or some other product produced by these or similar competing technologies will not supplant biodiesel as an alternative to conventional petrodiesel. 

&#160; 

The biodiesel industry also is in competition with the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry. The biodiesel industry is small relative to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Without government incentives and requirements, biodiesel would likely be more expensive than petroleum-based diesel, making it difficult for biodiesel to compete with petroleum-based diesel on price. 

&#160; 

Supply and Distribution 

&#160;

As a result of our feedstock-flexible process, we are able to source feedstock from a broad supplier base, which includes crude corn oil producers and pork, chicken, and beef rendering facilities from both national and regional suppliers. Crude corn oil has been sourced from several national and regional producers. All feedstocks are currently supplied by either rail or truck. We believe that an adequate supply of feedstocks can be sourced to support our anticipated production. 

&#160; 

We sell biodiesel from our plant site as well as ship it to liquid bulk storage facilities for further distribution. Sales from our plant site are made by railcar and tank truck. Biodiesel is being delivered by Company-owned tank trucks and common carriers to a liquid bulk storage facility leased by us for distribution there and for further transportation by barge or tank truck. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cyclicality and Seasonality 

&#160; 

Biodiesel producers have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel. Biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during the winter in northern and Midwestern states due to concerns about biodiesel&#8217;s ability to operate optimally in cold weather as compared to petrodiesel. This seasonal fluctuation has been strongest for biodiesel made from animal fats and used cooking oils. Biodiesel made from such feedstocks has a higher cloud point (which is the point at which a fuel begins to gel) than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils such as soybean, canola, or crude corn oil. This higher cloud point may cause cold weather performance issues. This historical seasonality appears to be decreasing as biodiesel blends are used in cold Midwestern states throughout the year. 

&#160; 

The mandate for biodiesel usage as established by RFS2 may interject an additional seasonal fluctuation in our biodiesel business. Once the mandate for a calendar year is met, or is anticipated to be met, demand for biodiesel may decrease. We experienced this type of seasonal fluctuation in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013 resulting in reduced profitability on biodiesel. This seasonal fluctuation was less prevalent in 2014 and 2015 given the weakened market conditions and the absence of a renewable fuel mandate. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Outlook for the Biodiesel Industry/Our Future Strategy 

&#160; 

The BTC was reinstated on December 18, 2015, and made retroactive to January 1, 2015 and effective through December 31, 2016. Based on analysis from industry analysts, it is anticipated that the U.S. biodiesel market may transition to larger plants, alternative feedstocks and second-generation technologies, resulting in consolidation among smaller, first-generation producers accompanied by a series of mergers and acquisitions in the field. Although it is unclear whether this trend will occur, if it does, we believe that producers who are proactive in responding to these changes can compete with foreign imports and benefit in this emerging market. These responses include: new and improved technologies; alternative feedstocks with higher yields; production scalability and flexibility options; supply chain, distribution and co-location strategies; the sale of RINs separate from the underlying biodiesel; and innovative risk management strategies. See http://www.emerging-markets.com/biodiesel/index.html . 

&#160; 

Our future strategy for our biofuels segment is geared towards these responses. We have redesigned our continuous line to produce biodiesel from lower cost feedstock with high free fatty acids. Debottlenecking has increased our annual capacity to in excess of 58 million gallons per year. Projects are currently in progress to further debottleneck the plant to run at higher rates. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding our future strategy, our continued production of biodiesel may be severely limited or eliminated entirely in the event Congress eliminates the federal mandate of the RFS2. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; beginning at page 15 below. 

&#160; 

Chemicals Business Segment 

&#160; 

Overview of the Segment 

&#160; 

Our chemicals segment manufactures diversified chemical products that are sold to third party customers. This segment comprises two components: &#8220;custom manufacturing&#8221; (manufacturing specialty chemicals for specific customers); and &#8220;performance chemicals&#8221; (multi-customer specialty chemicals). 

&#160; 

Chemical Products 

&#160; 

Custom manufacturing involves producing unique products for strategic customers, generally under long-term contracts. Many of these products are produced under confidentiality agreements in order to protect each company&#8217;s intellectual property. This is a service-based business where customers value dependability, regulatory compliance, technical capabilities, responsiveness, product quality, process scale up and improvement, operational safety, and environmental protection. Our custom products are manufactured by continuous production, dedicated batch or general purpose batch mode depending on the volumes required. We are recognized as a strategic production partner to our key customers in this segment and our engineering and technology teams collaboratively work together with our customers to further develop the processes and drive continued improvement. 

&#160; 

Our plant&#8217;s custom manufacturing product portfolio includes products that are used in the agricultural chemical, coatings, chemical intermediates, industrial and consumer cleaning, oil and gas, and specialty polymers industries. We historically have produced two significant products, or product families, within this particular portfolio. One of these products is our laundry detergent additive product, which is produced for a major detergent and consumer products manufacturer. The other of these was a proprietary herbicide and associated intermediates we produced for a former long-term customer. We ceased production for this legacy customer in 2014 and began the process of transitioning the equipment used for the production of the proprietary herbicide and intermediates into use for a different customer desiring a different proprietary herbicide. Our custom manufacturing business has grown with new customers in new markets, resulting in the customer for the laundry detergent additive product and the legacy proprietary herbicide customer playing a less significant role in our custom manufacturing portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Performance chemicals comprise multi-customer products which are sold based upon specification and/or performance in the end-use application. This portfolio includes a family of polymer (nylon and polyester) modifiers, glycerin products, and several small-volume specialty chemicals and solvents for diverse applications. In addition, we have recently been successful in growing our performance chemical business through new product development. New products include a family of acetal based solvents, including diethoxymethane, dimethoxymethane, dibutoxymethane, glycerol formal, and phenol sulfonic acid. In 2014, we added the capability to refine our crude glycerin to an industrial grade of glycerin for higher value specialty chemical applications. 

&#160; 

Future Strategy 

&#160; 

To build on and maintain our reputation as a technology-driven competitive chemical producer, we believe that we must continuously focus on customer relationship development, cost control, operational efficiency, capacity utilization, operational safety, and environmental protection to maximize earnings. The ability to utilize large-scale batch and continuous production processes and a continuous focus on process improvements allows us to compete effectively in the global custom manufacturing market and to remain cost competitive with, and for some products cost-advantaged over, our competitors. We intend to improve margins in this area of our business by careful management of product mix with regard to size of opportunity, timing to market, capital efficiency and matching of opportunities to assets and capabilities. 

&#160; 

Customers and Markets 

&#160; 

Our chemical products are used in a variety of markets and end uses, including detergent, agrochemical, automotive, oil and gas, coatings, nutrition, and polymer additives. Some of the chemical products can be cyclically driven by changes in energy and agricultural commodity prices. In the case of our custom manufacturing business, the customers are often the &#8220;brand owners&#8221; and therefore control factors related to demand, such as market development strategy. In such cases, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of sales revenue for these products. 

&#160; 

In September of 2015, we signed a contract amendment to extend the supply of our laundry detergent additive to our customer through 2018. This customer had previously expressed its intent to terminate the supply arrangement effective December 31, 2015, but it has now been reinstated on amended terms. The amendment (i) supersedes such customer&#8217;s notice of termination of the supply arrangement effective December 31, 2015; (ii) extends the term of the supply arrangement to December 31, 2018 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement, as amended); and (iii) provides for sales of the laundry detergent additive to this customer in reduced volumes with adjusted pricing during 2015-2018. This supply agreement allows us to sell certain formulations of the laundry detergent additive to third parties as a performance chemical. Sales of this product totaled less than 10% of our 2015 revenue. Demand for the laundry detergent additive has decreased in recent years. We continue to work collaboratively with our customer to assess their future demand, which may continue to decline. We are also working to find new customers for this product. 

&#160; 

None of our chemical customers represented 10% or more of our 2015 consolidated sales revenues. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Historically, there have been significant barriers to entry for competitors with respect to specialty chemicals primarily due to the fact that the relevant technology and manufacturing capability has been held by a small number of companies. As technology and investment have increasingly moved outside of North America, competition from multi-national chemical manufacturers has intensified, primarily from manufacturers in India and China. We compete with these and other producers primarily based on price, customer service, technology, quality, and reliability. Our major competitors in this segment include large multi-national companies with specialty chemical business units and smaller independent producers. The multi-national competitors are often disadvantaged by poor responsiveness and customer service, while the small producers often have limited technology and financial resources. We believe that we are well positioned for growth due to the combination of our scale of operations, technical capabilities, reputation, and financial strength. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Supply and Distribution 

&#160; 

Specialty chemicals are generally high unit value products sold in packaged, or low-volume bulk form, and for which distribution is a relatively minor component of cost. Most products are sold FOB the Batesville site for distribution globally. Similarly, raw materials for these products are comparatively higher-value components that are sourced globally. An exception will be the biofuels co-products, which will be recovered from local processing. 

&#160; 

Cyclicality and Seasonality 

&#160; 

Some of the chemical products can be cyclical, driven by changes in energy prices and agricultural commodity prices. For example, demand for chemical products sold into energy exploration and transportation markets is influenced by oil prices. The use of chemical products in agricultural markets likewise is influenced by agricultural commodity prices. Supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle. Despite sensitivity to cyclicality in these industries, many of the products in the chemical segment provide stable earnings. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

The majority of our revenues are derived under custom manufacturing agreements with specific customers. These customers generally provide us with forecasts of demand on a monthly or quarterly basis. These forecasts are intended to enable us to optimize the efficiency of our production processes and generally are not firm sales orders. As such, we do not monitor or report backlog. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We consider our intellectual property portfolio to be a valuable corporate asset which we intend to expand and protect globally through a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, patents, trademarks and copyrights. As a producer of a broad and diverse portfolio of chemicals, our intellectual property relates to a wide variety of products and processes acquired through the development and manufacture of over 300 specialty chemicals during the history of the site. Our primary strategy regarding our intellectual property portfolio will be to appropriately protect all innovations and know-how in order to provide our business segments with a technology-based competitive advantage wherever possible. In the chemicals business segment, custom manufacturing projects are primarily conducted within the framework of confidentiality agreements with each customer to ensure that intellectual property rights are defined and protected. In the biofuels business segment, innovations and process know-how will be vigorously protected as appropriate. 

&#160; 

As may be necessary, we will seek to license technologies from third parties that complement our strategic business objectives. Neither our business as a whole, nor any particular segment, is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, copyright, or trade secret. As the laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, we can make no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect all of our intellectual property assets. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We devote considerable resources to our research and development programs, which are primarily targeted towards three objectives: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

innovating, developing and improving biofuels processes, in particular biodiesel and other biofuels, including value-up technology and applications for co-products; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

developing and improving processes for custom manufacturing products; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

innovating, developing and improving performance chemical products and manufacturing processes. 

&#160; 

Our research and development capabilities comprise analytical chemistry competencies to assay and characterize raw materials and products, organic chemistry expertise applied across a breadth of reaction chemistries and materials, design and process engineering capabilities for batch and continuous processing of both solid and liquid materials, and proficiency in process safety to design and scale-up safe chemical manufacturing processes. We believe that these core competencies, established in support of the legacy chemical business, are applicable to building a technology-based position in biofuels and associated bio-based specialty products and expanding our performance chemicals product line. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and development expense incurred by us for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $2,741, $3,168, and $3,444, respectively. Substantially all of such research and development expense are related to the development of new products, services, and processes or the improvement of existing products, services, and processes. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Various aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by state and federal agencies. Biofuel and chemical operations are subject to numerous, stringent and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

require acquisition of permits regarding discharges into the air and discharge of waste waters; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

place restrictions on the handling and disposal of hazardous and other wastes; and; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

require capital expenditures to implement pollution control equipment. 

&#160; 

Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly and noncompliance can result in substantial civil and even criminal penalties. Some environmental laws impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Moreover, there is strong public interest in the protection of the environment. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the biofuels and/or chemical manufacturing industry in general. The following provides a general discussion of some of the significant environmental laws and regulations that impact our activities. 

&#160; 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (or &#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of the site where the release occurred, past owners and operators of the site, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Additionally, it is not uncommon for third parties to assert claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. 

&#160; 

The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (or &#8220;RCRA&#8221;), is the principal federal statute governing the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility. Many of the wastes generated in our manufacturing facility are governed by RCRA. 

&#160; 

The federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (or &#8220;OPA&#8221;) and regulations there under impose liability on responsible parties for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. Effective December 31, 2015, OPA increased its liability limit for onshore facilities from $350,000 to $633,850. These liability limits may not apply if a spill is caused by a party&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct, the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating regulation, or if a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. Failure to comply with OPA&#8217;s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

The federal Water Pollution Control Act (also referred to as the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;) imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties for discharges of oil and other pollutants, and imposes liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. Comparable state statutes impose liability and authorize penalties in the case of an unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other pollutants, into state waters. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including facilities involved in manufacturing chemicals and biofuels. New facilities are generally required to obtain permits before operations can commence, and new or existing facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures to install air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The federal Endangered Species Act, the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act, and similar federal and state wildlife protection laws prohibit or restrict activities that could adversely impact protected plant and animal species or habitats. Manufacturing activities could be prohibited or delayed in areas where such protected species or habitats may be located, or expensive mitigation may be required to accommodate such activities. 

&#160; 

Our policy is to operate our plant and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public. We intend to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with our policies and with the technology available. In some cases, applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the Clean Air Act and RCRA, and related actions of regulatory agencies, determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by us. 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for closure/post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets we maintain. Environmental assets include waste management units such as chemical waste destructors, landfills, storage tanks, and boilers. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on the expected life of the environmental assets, the applicable regulatory closure requirements, and our environmental policies and practices. These expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, we estimate the useful life of each individual asset up to 39 years. 

&#160; 

In addition to our general environmental policies and policies for asset retirement obligations and environmental reserves, we accrue environmental costs when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient data, particularly in the nature and timing of the future performance. In these cases, the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient data exists. With respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remedial requirements at the site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. 

&#160; 

Our cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately $10,205, $10,007, and $9,798 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also include expenditures for construction and development. While we do not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially increase our planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, we can give no assurances that such requirements will not materialize in the future. 

&#160; 

We believe that we have obtained in all material respects the necessary environmental permits and licenses to carry on our operations as presently conducted. We have reviewed environmental investigations of the properties owned by us and believe, on the basis of the results of the investigations carried out to date, that there are no material environmental issues which adversely impact us. In connection with the acquisition of our warehouse in Batesville, the seller agreed to remediate certain environmental conditions existing at the facility on the date that we acquired it and to indemnify us with respect to those environmental conditions. We continue to monitor the seller&#8217;s compliance with its remediation obligations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Management Team and Workforce 

&#160;

Our executive management team at the Batesville plant consists of individuals with a combined 90 plus years of experience in the chemicals industry, comprising technical, operational, and business responsibilities. The members of the executive team also have international experience, including assignments in Europe. The operational and commercial management group at the Batesville site includes additional degreed professionals with an average experience of over 25 years in the chemical industry. 

&#160; 

Our Batesville workforce comprises approximately 500 full-time employees, and includes degreed professionals including chemists (some with PhDs) and engineers (including licensed professional electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineers). Operations personnel have received extensive training and are highly skilled. Additionally, all site manufacturing and infrastructure is fully automated and computer-controlled. Due to the lack of locally-available process industry infrastructure, the workforce is substantially self-sufficient in the range of required operational skills and experience. Voluntary attrition at the site has averaged 4.3% over the past five years.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

Most of our sales are FOB the Batesville plant, although some transfer points are in other states or foreign ports. While many of our chemicals are utilized to manufacture products that are shipped, further processed, and/or consumed throughout the world, the chemical products, with limited exceptions, generally leave the United States only after we have transferred ownership. Rarely are we the exporter of record, never are we the importer of record into foreign countries, and we are not always aware of the exact quantities of our products that are moved into foreign markets by our customers. We do track the addresses of our customers for invoicing purposes and use this address to determine whether a particular sale is within or outside the United States. Our revenues for the last three fiscal years attributable to the United States and foreign countries (based upon the billing addresses of our customers) were as set forth in the following table.
