BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a leading technology and analytics company focused on providing online financial services. In 2015, we extended approximately $1.9 billion in credit to borrowers. As of December 31, 2015 we offered or arranged loans to consumers in 33 states in the United States and in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Brazil and China. We also offered financing to small businesses in all 50 states and Washington D.C. in the United States. We use our proprietary technology, analytics and customer service capabilities to quickly evaluate, underwrite and fund loans or provide financing, allowing us to offer consumers and small businesses credit or financing when and how they want it. Our customers include the large and growing number of consumers who and small businesses which have bank accounts but use alternative financial services because of their limited access to more traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. We were an early entrant into online lending, launching our online business in 2004, and through December 31, 2015, we have completed over 35.5 million customer transactions and collected approximately 12 terabytes of currently accessible consumer behavior data, allowing us to better analyze and underwrite our specific customer base. We have significantly diversified our business over the past several years having expanded the markets we serve and the financing products we offer. These financing products include short-term loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and receivables purchase agreements (&#8220;RPAs&#8221;). 

We believe our customers highly value our products and services as an important component of their personal or business finances because our products are convenient, quick and often less expensive than other available alternatives. We attribute the success of our business to our advanced and innovative technology systems, the proprietary analytical models we use to predict the performance of loans and finance receivables, our sophisticated customer acquisition programs, our dedication to customer service and our talented employees. 

We have developed proprietary underwriting systems based on data we have collected over our 11 years of experience. These systems employ advanced risk analytics to decide whether to approve financing transactions, to structure the amount and terms of the financings we offer pursuant to jurisdiction-specific regulations and to provide customers with their funds quickly and efficiently. Our systems closely monitor collection and portfolio performance data that we use to continually refine the analytical models and statistical measures used in making our credit, purchase, marketing and collection decisions. 

Our flexible and scalable technology platforms allow us to process and complete customers&#8217; transactions quickly and efficiently. In 2015, we processed approximately 3.6 million transactions, and we continue to grow our loan and finance receivables portfolio and increase the number of customers we serve through desktop, tablet and mobile platforms. Our highly customizable technology platforms allow us to efficiently develop and deploy new products to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and consumer preference, and to enter new markets quickly. In 2012, we launched a new product in the United States designed to serve near-prime customers, and in April 2014 we introduced a similar product in the United Kingdom. In June 2014, we launched a pilot program in Brazil, where we arrange financing for borrowers through a third party lender. In addition, in July 2014, we introduced a pilot program for a new line of credit product in the United States to serve the needs of small businesses. In June 2015, we further expanded our product offering by acquiring certain assets of a company that provides financing to small businesses by offering RPAs (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These new products are intended to allow us to further diversify our product offerings, customer base and geographic scope. In 2015, we derived 78.2% of our total revenue from the United States and 21.8% of our total revenue internationally, with 91.1% of international revenue (representing 19.9% of our total revenue) generated in the United Kingdom. 

We have been able to consistently acquire new customers and successfully generate repeat business from returning customers when they need financing. We believe our customers are loyal to us because they are satisfied with our products and services. We acquire new customers from a variety of sources, including visits to our own websites, mobile sites or applications, and through direct marketing, affiliate marketing, lead providers and relationships with other lenders. We believe that the online convenience of our products and our 24/7 availability to accept applications with quick approval decisions are important to our customers.

Once a potential customer submits an application, we quickly provide a credit or purchase decision. If a loan or financing is approved we or our lending partner typically fund the loan or financing the next business day or, in some cases, the same day. During the entire process, from application through payment, we provide access to our well-trained customer service team. All of our operations, from customer acquisition through collections, are structured to build customer satisfaction and loyalty, in the event that a customer has a need for our products in the future. We have developed a series of sophisticated proprietary scoring models to support our various products. We believe that these models are an integral component of our operations and they allow us to complete a high volume of customer transactions while actively managing risk and the related credit quality of our loan and finance receivable portfolios. We believe our successful application of these technology innovations differentiates our capabilities relative to competitive platforms as evidenced by our history of strong growth and stable credit quality.

&#160;

Products and Services 

Our online financing products and services provide customers with a deposit of funds to their bank account or onto a debit card in exchange for a commitment to repay the amount deposited plus fees, interest and/or revenue on the receivables purchased. We originate, arrange, guarantee or purchase short-term consumer loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and RPAs. We have one reportable segment that includes all of our online financial services. 

Short-term consumer loans . Short-term consumer loans are unsecured loans written by us or by a third-party lender through our credit services organization and credit access business programs, which we refer to as our CSO programs, that we arrange and guarantee. As of December 31, 2015, we offered or arranged short-term consumer loans in 23 states in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Short-term consumer loans generally have terms of seven to 90 days, with proceeds promptly deposited in the customer&#8217;s bank account or onto a debit card in exchange for a pre-authorized debit from their account. Due to the credit risk and high transaction costs of serving our customer segment, the interest and/or fees we charge are generally considered to be higher than the interest or fees charged to consumers with superior credit histories by banks and similar lenders who are typically unwilling to make unsecured loans to alternative credit consumers. Our short-term consumer loans contributed approximately 31.4% of our total revenue in 2015, 31.7% in 2014, and 50.9% in 2013. 

Line of credit accounts . We offer consumer line of credit accounts in seven states in the United States and business line of credit accounts in 22 states in the United States, which allow customers to draw on their unsecured line of credit in increments of their choosing up to their credit limit. Customers may pay off their account balance in full at any time or make required minimum payments in accordance with their terms of the line of credit account. As long as the customer&#8217;s account is in good standing and has credit available, customers may continue to borrow on their line of credit. As a result of regulatory changes in 2014, we discontinued offering line of credit accounts to new customers in the United Kingdom in late 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, we discontinued draws on those existing accounts. Our line of credit accounts contributed approximately 28.4% of our total revenue in 2015, 37.7% in 2014, and 22.3% in 2013. 

Installment loans . Installment loans are longer-term loans that generally require the outstanding principal balance to be paid down in multiple installments. We offer, or arrange through our CSO Programs and in Brazil, multi-payment unsecured consumer installment loan products in 16 states in the United States and in the United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil. Terms for our installment loan products range between two and 60 months. These loans generally have higher principal amounts than short-term loans. The loan may be repaid early at any time with no prepayment charges. Our installment loans contributed approximately 39.9% of our total revenue in 2015, 30.5% in 2014, and 26.6% in 2013. 

We have been investing and will continue to invest in the growth of our near-prime installment lending portfolio, particularly loans with an annual percentage rate, or APR, at or below 36%, and those through loan programs that we are establishing with a small number of banks.

CSO Programs . Through our CSO programs, we provide services related to third-party lenders&#8217; short-term and installment loan products by acting as a credit services organization or credit access business on behalf of consumers in accordance with applicable state laws. Services offered under our CSO programs include credit-related services such as arranging loans with independent third-party lenders and assisting in the preparation of loan applications and loan documents, or CSO loans. Under our CSO programs, we guarantee consumer loan payment obligations to the third party lender in the event the customer defaults on the loan. When a consumer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the consumer, to provide certain services, one of which is to guarantee the consumer&#8217;s obligation to repay the loan received by the consumer from the third-party lender if the consumer fails to do so. For CSO loans, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the consumer&#8217;s application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We, in turn, are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loan. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific short-term loans, which generally have terms of less than 90 days, and specific installment loans, which have terms of four to 12 months, if they go into default. 

As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the outstanding amount of active short-term consumer loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $34.1 million, $36.3 million and $41.4 million, respectively, which were guaranteed by us.

The outstanding amount of active installment loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs, which have terms of four to 12 months, was $9.0 million and $7 thousand as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively, which were guaranteed by us.

Receivables purchase agreements. Under RPAs, small businesses receive funds in exchange for a portion of the business&#8217;s future receivables at an agreed upon discount. In contrast, lending is a commitment to repay principal and interest. A small business customer who enters into a RPA commits to delivering a percentage of its receivables through ACH or wire debits or by splitting credit card receipts until all purchased receivables are delivered. We offer RPAs in all 50 states and in Washington D.C. in the United States. 

&#160;

Our Markets 

We currently provide our services in the following countries: 

United States. We began our online business in the United States in May 2004. As of December 31, 2015, we provided services in all 50 states and Washington D.C. We market our financing products under the names CashNetUSA at www.cashnetusa.com, NetCredit at www.netcredit.com, Headway Capital at www.headwaycapital.com and The Business Backer at www.businessbacker.com. The United States represented 78.2% of our total revenue in 2015 and 58.6% of our total revenue in 2014. 

United Kingdom . We provide services in the United Kingdom under the names QuickQuid at www.quickquid.co.uk, Pounds to Pocket at www.poundstopocket.co.uk and On Stride Financial at www.onstride.co.uk. We began our QuickQuid short-term consumer loan business in July 2007, our Pounds to Pocket installment loan business in September 2010, and our On Stride near-prime installment loan business in April 2014. We offered a line of credit product from March 2013 to December 2014 under the brand name QuickQuid FlexCredit. The United Kingdom represented 19.9% of our total revenue in 2015 and 40.1% of our total revenue in 2014. Our results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 do not include the full impact of changes in our U.K. operations resulting from regulatory and legislative changes that occurred in 2014. 

Australia. We provide services under the name DollarsDirect at www.dollarsdirect.com.au in Australia, and we began providing services there in May 2009. Australia represented 0.9% of our total revenue in 2015 and 0.5% of our total revenue in 2014.

Brazil. On June 30, 2014, we launched a pilot program in Brazil where we arrange installment loans for a third party lender under the name Simplic at www.simplic.com.br. We plan to continue to invest and expand our lending in Brazil as the program moves out of a pilot phase. Brazil represented 0.3% of total revenue in 2015. 

Key Financial and Operating Metrics 

We have achieved significant growth since we began our online business as we have expanded both our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve. We measure our business using several financial and operating metrics. Our key metrics include domestic and international combined loans and finance receivables outstanding, in addition to other measures described under &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

This growth in product offerings and geographic markets has resulted in significant revenue diversification, as set forth below: 

&#160;

Additional financial information regarding our operating segment and each of the geographic areas in which we do business is provided in &#8220;Note 17. Operating Segment Information&#8212;Geographic Information&#8221; to our Audited Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Recent Regulatory Developments&#8212;Financial Conduct Authority&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 of this report for a discussion about our expectations for our U.K. business going forward. 

&#160;

Our Industry 

The internet has transformed how consumers and small businesses shop for and acquire products and services. According to International Data Corporation, global internet usage is expected to increase at a pace of 2% annually through 2020, with 3.2 billion people, or 44% of the world&#8217;s population, having access to the internet in 2016. As internet accessibility has grown, a number of traditional financial services such as banking, bill payment and investing have become widely available online. A March 2015 report by the Consumer and Community Development Research Section of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Board of Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (&#8220;DCCA&#8221;) found that approximately 74% of bank customers in a U.S. sample reported having interacted with their financial institution using online banking tools, up 9% from 2011. This level of use highlights the extent to which consumers now accept the internet for conducting their financial transactions and are willing to entrust their financial information to online companies. We believe the increased acceptance of online financial services has led to an increased demand for online lending and financing, the benefits of which include customer privacy, easy access, security, 24/7 availability to apply for a loan or financing, speed of funding and transparency of fees and interest. 

We use the internet to serve the large and growing number of underbanked consumers and small businesses who have bank accounts but use alternative financial services because of their limited access to more traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. Demand from these consumers has been fueled by several demographic and socioeconomic trends, including an overall increase in the population and stagnant to declining growth in the household income for working-class individuals. The necessity for alternative financial services was highlighted by a May 2015 report from the Consumer and Community Development Research Section of the DCCA, which found that half of the 47% of respondents could not cover an emergency expense of $400, or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money. The report also found a sizeable portion of the population is unable to access credit through traditional financial channels, with many instead turning to alternative financial services options. Approximately 17% of respondents had been denied credit, were offered less credit than they desired, or desired credit but did not apply for fear of denial. Thirty-eight percent of those individuals indicated they had used some form of alternative financial services.

We believe that consumers and small businesses seek online lending services for numerous reasons, including because they often: 

&#160;

&#183; 

prefer the simplicity, transparency and convenience of these services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

require access to financial services outside of normal banking hours; 

&#160;

&#183; 

have an immediate need for cash for financial challenges and unexpected expenses; 

&#160;

&#183; 

have been unable to access certain traditional lending or other credit services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

seek an alternative to the high cost of bank overdraft fees, credit card and other late payment fees and utility late payment fees or disconnect and reconnection fees; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

wish to avoid potential negative credit consequences of missed payments with traditional creditors. 

Our Customers 

Our customer base is comprised largely of individuals living in households that earn between $25,000 and $50,000 annually in the United States and between &#163;13,000 and &#163;23,000 annually in the United Kingdom, most of whom are considered sub-prime borrowers. Based on our analysis of industry data, we believe our addressable markets are approximately 68 million and 7 million individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. The short-term lending market is sizable in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The Center for Financial Services Innovation has estimated that the online lending market opportunity in the United States represented approximately $39 billion in loan volume in 2012. The U.K. Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards estimated that the high-cost credit market, which includes short-term lending, represented over $9 billion in loan volume as of September 2013. However, in its February 2015 final report following its investigation of the U.K. payday lending industry, the Competition &#38; Markets Authority found that revenue for the seven major payday lenders was down 27% year over year for the first nine months of 2014. Our small business customers who enter into RPAs average approximately $2 million in annual sales and 12 years of operating history while those who obtain an open line of credit account average approximately $500 thousand in annual sales and 7 years of operating history.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths position us well for continued growth: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Significant operating history and first mover advantage. As an early entrant in the online lending sector, we have accumulated approximately 12 terabytes of currently accessible consumer behavior data from more than 35 million transactions in our more than eleven years of experience. This database allows us to market to a customer base with an established borrowing history as well as to better evaluate and underwrite new customers, leading to better loan performance. In order to develop a comparable 

&#160;

&#160;

database, we believe that competitors would need to incur high marketing and customer acquisition costs, overcome customer brand loyalties and have sufficient capital to withstand higher early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. Additionally, we are licensed in all jurisdictions which require licensing and believe that it would be difficult and time consuming for a new entrant to obtain such licenses. We have also created strong brand recognition over our more than eleven years of operating history and we continue to invest in our brands, such as CashNetUSA, NetCredit, Pounds to Pocket, QuickQuid, DollarsDirect, On Stride Financial, Headway Capital, The Business Backer and Simplic, to further increase our visibility. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Proprietary analytics, data and underwriting . We have developed a fully integrated decision engine that evaluates and rapidly makes credit and other determinations throughout the customer relationship, including automated decisions regarding marketing, underwriting, customer contact and collections. Our decision engine currently handles more than 100 algorithms and over 1,000 variables. These algorithms are constantly monitored, validated, updated and optimized to continuously improve our operations. Our proprietary models are built on over eleven years of lending history, using advanced statistical methods that take into account our experience with the millions of transactions we have processed during that time and the use of data from numerous third-party sources. Since we designed our system specifically for our specialized products, we believe our system provides more predictive assessments of future loan behavior than traditional credit assessments, such as the Fair Isaac Corporation score, or FICO score, and therefore, results in better evaluation of our customer base. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Scalable and flexible technology platforms. Our proprietary technology platforms are designed to be powerful enough to handle the large volume of data required to evaluate customer applications and flexible enough to capitalize on changing customer preferences, market trends and regulatory requirements. These platforms have enabled us to achieve significant growth over more than eleven years as we have expanded both our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve. We began offering installment loans in the United States and United Kingdom in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and added line of credit products in the United States and United Kingdom in 2010 and 2013, respectively. We have experienced significant growth in these products, with revenue contribution from installment and line of credit products increasing from 11.7% of total revenue in 2010 to 68.3% of total revenue in 2015. Similarly, total revenue contribution from our international operations, primarily in the United Kingdom, grew from $40.5 million, or 15.9% of total revenue in 2009, to $335.1 million, or 41.4% of total revenue in 2014, before declining to $142.4 million, or 21.8% of total revenue in 2015 due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom. Due to the scalability of our platform, we were able to achieve this growth without significant investment in additional infrastructure, and over the past three years capital expenditures have averaged only 2.8% of revenue per year. We expect our advanced technology and underwriting platform to help continue to drive significant growth in our business. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on customer experience. We believe that alternative credit consumers and small businesses are not adequately served by traditional lenders. To better serve these consumers and small businesses, we use customer-focused business practices, including extended-hours availability of our customer service team by phone, email, fax and web chat. We continuously work to improve customer satisfaction by evaluating information from website analytics, customer surveys, call center feedback and focus groups. Our call center teams receive training on a regular basis and are monitored by quality assurance managers. We believe customers who wish to access credit again often return to us because of our dedication to customer service, the transparency of our fees and interest charges and our adherence to trade association &#8220;best practices.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Diligent regulatory compliance. We conduct our business in a highly regulated industry. We are focused on regulatory compliance and have devoted significant resources to comply with laws that apply to us, while we believe many of our online competitors have traditionally not done so. We tailor our lending products and services to comply with the specific requirements of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to fees, loan durations and renewals or extensions, loan amounts, disclosures and underwriting requirements. Our compliance experience and proprietary technology platform allow us to launch new products and to enter new geographic regions with a focus on compliance with applicable laws and customer protection. We are members of industry trade groups, including the Online Lenders Alliance in the United States and the Consumer Finance Association in the United Kingdom, which have promulgated &#8220;best practices&#8221; for our industry that we have adopted. The flexibility of our online platform enables us to rapidly adapt our products as necessary to comply with changes in regulation, without the need for costly and time consuming retraining of store-based employees and other expenses faced by our storefront competitors. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Proven history of growth and profitability. Over the last five years, we grew our net loan and finance receivables, which are the gross outstanding balances for our loan and finance receivables carried in the consolidated balance sheets net of the allowance for estimated losses, at a compound annual growth rate of 27.8%, from $163.0 million as of December 31, 2011 to $434.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Over the same period, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.0%, from $480.3 million in 2011 to $652.6 million in 2015, while Adjusted EBITDA grew at a compound annual growth rate of 15.4%, from $87.7 million to $155.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin has likewise improved, increasing over 500 basis points from 18.3% of revenue in 2011 to 23.9% of revenue in 2015. See note (a) in &#8220;Selected Financial Data&#8212;Part II, Item 6&#8221; of this report for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (which is Adjusted EBITDA margin). &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Talented, highly educated employees. We believe we have one of the most skilled and talented teams of professionals in the industry. Our employees have exceptional educational backgrounds, with numerous post-graduate and undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. We hire and develop top talent from graduate and undergraduate programs at institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. The extensive education of our team is complemented by the experience our leadership team obtained at leading technology firms and financial services companies such as optionsXpress, HSBC, First American Bank and JPMorgan Chase. 

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase penetration in existing markets through direct marketing . We believe that we have reached only a small number of the potential customers for our products and services in the markets in which we currently operate. We continue to focus on our direct customer acquisition channels, with direct marketing (traditional and digital) generating approximately 52% of our new consumer transactions in 2015, as compared to 32% in 2009. We believe these channels will ultimately allow us to reach a larger customer base at a lower acquisition cost than the traditional online lead purchasing model. Additionally, as our smaller and less sophisticated competitors, both online and storefront, struggle to adapt to both regulatory developments and evolving customer preference, we believe we have the opportunity to gain significant market share. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand globally to reach new markets . We are building on our global reach by entering new markets. In June 2014, we launched a pilot program in Brazil, where we began arranging loans for borrowers through a third party lender. We also operated a pilot program in China in 2014 and 2015 where we arranged loans for borrowers through a third party lender but have decided to address the Chinese market as a service provider and/or analytics provider going forward. We believe that these countries have significant populations of underserved consumers. When pursuing geographic expansion, factors we consider include, among others, whether there is (i) widespread internet usage, (ii) an established and interconnected banking system and (iii) government policy that promotes the extension of credit. Our recent pilots in Brazil and China, as well as our launches into the United Kingdom in 2007 and Australia and Canada in 2009, demonstrate that we can quickly and efficiently enter and explore new markets. Our revenue from international operations has increased from $1.6 million in 2007, or 0.9% of our total revenue, to $142.4 million in 2015, or 21.8% of our total revenue. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Introduce new products and services . We plan to attract new categories of consumers and small businesses not served by traditional lenders through the introduction of new products and services. We have introduced new products to expand our businesses from solely single-payment consumer loans to installment loans, line of credit accounts and small business loans, using our analytics expertise and our flexible and scalable technology platform. In 2012, we launched NetCredit, a longer duration installment loan product for near-prime consumers in the United States, and we launched On Stride Financial, a similar near-prime product, in the United Kingdom in April 2014. In late July 2014 we launched Headway Capital, a pilot program for a new line of credit product in the United States that serves the needs of small businesses. On June 23, 2015, we completed the purchase of certain assets of a company operating as The Business Backer, which now allows us to provide short-term financing to small businesses throughout the United States through RPAs. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate and offer new products and services that complement our online specialty financial services in order to meet the growing needs of our consumers and small businesses. 

Online Loan Process 

Our consumer and small business loan transactions are conducted almost exclusively online. When a customer takes out a new loan, funds are promptly deposited in the customer&#8217;s bank account or onto a debit card in exchange for a pre-authorized debit for repayment from the customer&#8217;s account. Where permitted by law and approved by us, a customer may choose to renew a short-term consumer loan before payment becomes due by agreeing to pay an additional finance charge. If a loan is renewed or refinanced, the renewal or refinanced loan is considered a new loan. 

&#160;

We have created a quick and simple process for customers to apply for an online loan, as shown below: 

Technology Platform 

Our proprietary technology platforms are built for scalability and flexibility and are based on proven open source software. The technology platforms were designed to be powerful enough to handle the large volumes of data required to evaluate customer and small business applications and flexible enough to capitalize on changing customer preferences, market trends and regulatory changes. The scalability and flexibility of our technology platforms allow us to enter new markets and launch new products quickly, typically within three to six months from conception to launch. 

We continually employ technological innovations to improve our technology platforms, which perform a variety of integrated and core functions, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Front-end system , which includes external websites, landing pages and mobile sites and applications that customers use when applying for loans or financing and managing their accounts; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Back-end and customer relationship management, or CRM, systems , which maintain customer-level data and are used by our call center employees to provide real-time information for all inquiries. Our back-end system and CRM system includes, among other things, our contact management system, operational and marketing management system, automated phone system, Interactive Voice Response and call center performance management system; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Decision engine , which rapidly evaluates and makes credit and financing decisions throughout the customer relationship; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Financial system , which manages the external interface for funds transfers and provides daily accounting, reconciliation and reporting functions. 

The key elements of our technology platforms include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Scalable Information Technology infrastructure. Our Information Technology infrastructure allows us to meet customer demand and accommodate business growth. Our services rely on accessing, evaluating and creating large volumes of data including, for example, information collected from approximately 40 million credit reports during 2015. This rich dataset has grown significantly over our more than eleven year history and will continue to grow as our business expands. We believe that our scalable IT infrastructure enables us to meet substantial growth demands. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Flexible software and integration systems. Our software system is designed to allow us to enter new markets and launch new products rapidly, modify our business operations quickly and account for complex regulatory requirements imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have developed a proprietary software solution that allows us to innovate quickly and to improve the customer experience. Our integration system allows us to easily interface with banks and other strategic partners in order to deliver the best financial products and services possible. Our software and integration systems and their flexibility allow us much more control over the continually evolving aspects of our business. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rapid development processes. Our software development life cycle is rapid and iterative to increase the efficiency of our platform. We are able to implement software updates while maintaining our system stability. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Security. We collect and store personally identifiable customer information, including names, addresses, social security numbers and bank account information. We have safeguards designed to protect this information. We also created controls to limit employee access to that information and to monitor that access. Our safeguards and controls have been independently verified through regular and recurring audits and assessments. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Redundant disaster recovery. Certain key parts of our technology platform, such as our phone system for handling U.S. and U.K. customer service on consumer loans, are distributed across two different locations. In addition, critical components of our platform are redundant. This provides redundancy, fault tolerance and disaster recovery functionality in case of a catastrophic outage. 

Proprietary Data and Analytics 

Decision Engine 

We have developed a fully integrated decision engine that evaluates and rapidly makes credit and other determinations throughout the customer relationship, including automated decisions regarding marketing, underwriting, customer contact and collections. Our decision engine currently handles more than 100 algorithms and over 1,000 variables. The algorithms in use are constantly monitored, validated, updated and optimized to continuously improve our operations. In order to support the daily running and ongoing improvement of our decision engine, we have assembled a highly skilled team of approximately 50 data and analytics professionals as of December 31, 2015. 

Proprietary Data, Models and Underwriting 

Our proprietary models are built on more than eleven years of history, using advanced statistical methods that take into account our experience with the millions of transactions we have processed during that time and the use of data from numerous third-party sources. We continually update our underwriting models to manage risk of defaults and to structure loan terms. Our system completes these assessments within seconds of receiving the customer&#8217;s data. 

Our underwriting system is able to assess risks associated with each customer individually based on specific customer information and historical trends in our portfolio. We use a combination of numerous factors when evaluating a potential customer, which can include a consumer&#8217;s income, rent or mortgage payment amount, employment history, external credit bureau scores, amount and status of outstanding debt and other recurring expenditures, fraud reports, repayment history, charge-off history and the length of time the customer has lived at his or her current address. While the relative weight or importance of the specific variables that we consider when underwriting a loan changes from product to product, generally, the key factors that we consider for loans include monthly gross income, disposable income, length of employment, duration of residency, credit report history and prior loan performance history if the applicant is a returning customer. Similar factors are considered for small business applicants and also include length of time in business, online business reviews, and sales volumes. Our customer base for consumer loans is predominantly in the low to fair range of FICO scores, with scores generally between 500 and 680 for most of our loan products. We generally do not take into account a potential customer&#8217;s FICO score when deciding whether to make a loan. A Vantage score is one of the factors in our credit models for our near-prime installment product in the United States. Since we designed our system specifically for our specialized products, we believe our system provides more predictive assessments of future payment behavior and results in better evaluation of our customer base when compared to traditional credit assessments, such as a FICO score. 

Fraud Prevention 

Our robust fraud prevention system is built from in-depth analysis of previous fraud incidences and information from third party data sources. To ensure sustainable growth, our fraud prevention team has built rigorous systems and processes to detect fraud trends, identify fraudulent applications and learn from past fraudulent cases. 

Working together with multiple vendors, our systems first determine whether the customer information submitted matches other indicia regarding the application and that the applicant can authorize transactions for the submitted bank account. To prevent more organized and systematic fraud, we have developed predictive models that incorporate signals from various sources that we have found to be useful in identifying fraud. These models utilize advanced data mining algorithms and recent technologies to effectively identify fraudulent applications with a very low false positive rate. In addition, we have built strong loan processing teams that handle suspicious activities efficiently while minimizing friction in customer experience. Our fraud prevention system incorporates algorithms to differentiate customers in an effort to identify suspected fraudulent activity and to reduce our risks of loss from fraud.

We continuously develop and implement ongoing improvements to these systems and, while no system can completely protect against losses from fraud, we believe our systems provide protection against significant fraud losses. 

&#160;

Marketing 

We use a multi-channel approach to marketing our online loans, with both broad-reach and highly-targeted channels, including television, digital, direct mail, telemarketing and partner marketing (which includes lead providers, independent brokers and marketing affiliates). The goal of our marketing is to promote our brands and products in the online lending marketplace and to directly acquire new customers at low cost. Our marketing has successfully built strong awareness of and preference for our brands, as our products have achieved market leadership through the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Traditional advertising . We use television, direct mail, radio and outdoor advertisements, supported by technology infrastructure and key vendors, to drive and optimize website traffic and loan volume. We believe our investments through these channels have helped create strong brand awareness and preference in the customer segments and markets we serve. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Digital acquisition . Our online marketing efforts include pay-per-click, keyword advertising, search engine optimization, marketing affiliate partnerships, social media programs and mobile advertising integrated with our operating systems and technology from vendors that allow us to optimize customer acquisition tactics within the daily operations cycle. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Partner Marketing . We purchase qualified leads for prospective new customers from a number of online lead providers and independent brokers and through marketing affiliate partnerships. We believe that our rapid decision-making on lead purchases, strong customer conversion rate and significant scale in each of our markets make us a preferred partner for lead providers and affiliates while at the same time our technology and analytics help us determine the right price for the right leads. 

&#160;

&#183; 

User experience and conversion. We measure and monitor website visitor usage metrics and regularly test website design strategies to improve customer experience and conversion rates. 

Our brand, technology and analytics-powered approach to marketing has enabled us to increase the percentage of consumer loans sourced through direct marketing (where we have more visibility and control than in the lead purchase or affiliate channels) from approximately 32% in 2009 to 52% in 2015, and we believe we have also improved customer brand loyalty during the same period. 

Customer Service 

We believe that our in-house call center and our emphasis on superior customer service are significant contributors to our growth. To best serve our consumers and small businesses, we use customer-oriented business practices, such as offering extended-hours customer service. We continuously work to improve our customers&#8217; experience and satisfaction by evaluating information from website analytics, customer satisfaction surveys, call center feedback, call monitoring and focus groups. Our call center teams receive training on a regular basis, are monitored by quality assurance managers and adhere to rigorous internal service-level agreements. We do not outsource our call center operations, except in Brazil. We have two call center facilities, one in our corporate offices in Chicago and another in Gurnee, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 500 employees in our call centers supporting our customers. 

Collections 

We operate centralized collection teams within our two call centers to coordinate a consistent approach. We have implemented loan and financing collection policies and practices designed to optimize regulatory compliant loan and financing repayment, while also providing excellent customer service. Our collections employees are trained to help the customer understand available payment alternatives and make arrangements to repay the loan or financing. We use a variety of collection strategies to satisfy a delinquent loan, such as settlements and payment plans, or to adjust the delivery of finance receivables. 

Call center employees contact customers following the first missed payment and periodically thereafter. Our primary methods of contacting past due customers are through phone calls, letters and emails. At times, we sell loans that we are unable to collect to debt collection companies or place the debt for collection with debt collection companies. 

Competition 

We have many competitors. Our principal competitors are consumer loan companies, CSOs, online lenders, credit card companies, consumer finance companies, auto title lenders, pawnshops and other financial institutions that offer similar financial products and services, including loans on an unsecured as well as a secured basis. We believe that there is also indirect competition to some of our products, including bank overdraft facilities and banks&#8217; and retailers&#8217; insufficient funds policies, many of which may be more expensive alternative approaches for consumers and small businesses to cover their bills and expenses than the consumer and small business loan and financing products we offer. Some of our U.S. competitors operate using other business models, including a &#8220;tribal model&#8221; where the lender follows the laws of a Native American tribe regardless of the state in which the customer resides. 

&#160;

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer and small business loan and financing industry consist of the ability to provide sufficient loan size to meet customers&#8217; loan requests, speed of funding, customer privacy, ease of access, transparency of fees and interest and customer service. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage as an early mover in many of the markets that we serve. New entrants face obstacles typical to launching new lending operations, such as successfully implementing underwriting and fraud prevention processes, incurring high marketing and customer acquisition costs, overcoming customer brand loyalty and having or obtaining sufficient capital to withstand early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. In addition, there are substantial regulatory and compliance costs, including the need for expertise to customize products and obtain licenses to lend in various states in the United States and in international jurisdictions. Our proprietary technology, analytics expertise, scale, international reach, brand recognition and regulatory compliance would be difficult for a new competitor to duplicate. 

Because numerous competitors offer consumer and small business loan and financing products, and many of our competitors are privately held, it is difficult for us to determine our exact competitive position in the market. However, we believe our principal online competitors in the United States include Avant, Elevate, LendUP and Speedy Cash. Storefront consumer loan lenders that offer loans online or in storefronts are also a source of competition in some of the markets where we offer consumer loans, including Advance America, Ace Cash Express, Check Into Cash, Check &#8216;n Go, Dollar Financial and One Main Financial. For online small business financing, we believe our main competitors are CAN Capital, OnDeck and Kabbage. In the United Kingdom, we believe that our principal online competitors include 118118, Amigo, Avant, Lending Stream, Mr. Lender, PaydayUK, Satsuma, Sunny and Wonga. In Australia, we believe our main online competitors are Nimble, Cash Converters and Money3. In Canada, the industry has been dominated by storefront lenders, and as a result, our principal competitors are not online lenders but storefront lenders, such as Money Mart and Cash Money. 

Our products also compete with those of other financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, pawn shops, credit services organizations, auto title lenders and consumer finance companies, which can offer loans on an unsecured as well as a secured basis. 

Intellectual Property 

Protecting our rights to our intellectual property is critical, as it enhances our ability to offer distinctive services and products to our customers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark laws and trade secret protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our proprietary analytics, predictive underwriting models and software systems. We have several registered trademarks, including CashNetUSA, QuickQuid, DollarsDirect and our &#8220;e&#8221; logo. These trademarks have varying expiration dates, and we believe they are materially important to us and we anticipate maintaining them and renewing them. 

Seasonality 

Demand for our short-term consumer loan products and services in the United States has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the holiday season, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers&#8217; receipt of income tax refunds. Typically, our cost of revenue for our short-term consumer loan products, which represents our loan loss provision, is lowest as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers&#8217; receipt of income tax refunds, and increases as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of each year. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our domestic operating results and cash needs.

Additional financial information regarding our operating segment and each of the geographic areas in which we do business is provided in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 17&#8221; of this report.

Market and Industry Data 

The market and industry data contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including trends in our markets and our position within such markets, are based on a variety of sources, including our good faith estimates, which are derived from our review of internal surveys, information obtained from customers and publicly available information, as well as from independent industry publications, reports by market research firms and other published independent sources. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information. None of the independent industry publications used in this report were prepared on our behalf. 

REGULATION 

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, local and international statutes, ordinances and regulations.

U.S. Federal Regulation 

Consumer Lending Laws. Our consumer loan business is subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, and its underlying regulations, known as Regulation Z, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under TILA are intended to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Under TILA, when acting as a lender, we are required to disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. The FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits us from discriminating against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age, and requires us to notify credit applicants of any action taken on the individual&#8217;s credit application. 

Consumer Reports and Information. The use of consumer reports and other personal data used in credit underwriting is governed by the FCRA and similar state laws governing the use of consumer credit information. The FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of &#8220;consumer reports&#8221; and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers where their loan application has been denied because of information contained in their consumer report. The FCRA requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. 

Information-Sharing Laws. We are also subject to the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which limits the sharing of information with affiliates for marketing purposes and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and responding appropriately to mitigate identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures and provide training and materials that address the importance of protecting non-public personal information and aid us in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity that may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate. 

&#160;

Marketing Laws. Our advertising and marketing activities are subject to several federal laws and regulations including the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements in all aspects of our business. As a financial services company, any advertisements related to our products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in TILA. Also, any of our telephone marketing activities must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or the TCPA, and the Telephone Sales Rule, or the TSR. The TCPA prohibits the use of automatic telephone dialing systems for communications with wireless phone numbers without express consent of the consumer, and the TSR established the Do Not Call Registry and sets forth standards of conduct for all telemarketing. Our advertising and marketing activities are also subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to the source of content. 

Protection of Military Members and Dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate to 36% on certain consumer loans made to active duty members of the U.S. military, reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate families. This 36% annual percentage rate cap applies to a variety of consumer loan products, including short-term consumer loans. Therefore, due to these rate restrictions, we are unable to offer certain short-term consumer loans to active duty military personnel, active reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on existing loans when the borrower, or spouse of the borrower, becomes an active-duty member of the military during the life of a loan. Pursuant to federal law, the interest rate must be reduced to 6% per year on amounts outstanding during the time in which the servicemember is on active duty. 

On July 22, 2015, the Department of Defense published its final rule amending the MLA&#8217;s implementing regulation. The new rule expands the scope of the credit products covered by the MLA. The rules under the MLA will restrict us from offering consumer loan products to covered borrowers at the military annual percentage rate, which is defined by the rules, of more than 36%, and contain various disclosure requirements, limitations on renewals and refinancing, as well as restrictions on the use of prepayment penalties, arbitration provisions and certain waivers of rights. The rule provides that a lender is subject to fines and other penalties if it extends credit to a covered borrower on prohibited terms. The new rule provides a safe harbor for a lender if it verifies an applicant&#8217;s status as a covered borrower before extending credit by checking the Department of Defense&#8217;s database or a database of a national credit reporting agency that provides military status information. The new rule is scheduled to become effective on October 3, 2016. 

Funds Transfer and Signature Authentication Laws. The consumer loan business is also subject to the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act and various other laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures required in debiting or crediting a debtor&#8217;s bank account relating to a consumer loan (i.e., Automated Clearing House, or ACH, funds transfer). Furthermore, we are subject to various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures. 

Debt Collection Practices. Additionally, our CSO programs are required to comply with the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, and we also use the FDCPA as a guide in connection with operating our other collection activities. We are also required to comply with all applicable state collection practices laws. 

Privacy and Security of Non-Public Customer Information. We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we must disclose to consumers our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be made to consumers when the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information. These regulations also dictate certain actions that we must take to notify consumers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions. We are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals. Certain of our subsidiaries are also registered as money services businesses with the U.S. Treasury Department and must re-register with the Treasury Department&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, at least every two years. 

Anticorruption. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. 

&#160;

CFPB 

In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans that we offer. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of such providers. Pursuant to these powers, the CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB.

On November 20, 2013, Cash America, our parent company at the time, consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 examination of Cash America and us, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. The Consent Order relates in part to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB by us, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active-duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the annual percentage rate permitted by the federal Military Lending Act, and for which we have made refunds of approximately $33,500, and for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB&#8217;s examination of us. In addition, as a result of the CFPB&#8217;s review, we have enhanced and continue to enhance our compliance management system and have implemented additional policies and procedures to address the issues identified by the CFPB. These new policies, procedures and other initiatives are in many cases subject to review and potential objection by the CFPB. We remain subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including the CFPB&#8217;s order that we ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws and develop more robust compliance policies and procedures. 

On April 24, 2013, the CFPB issued a report entitled &#8220;Payday Loans and Deposit Advance Products: A White Paper of Initial Findings,&#8221; indicating that it had &#8220;engaged in an in-depth review of short-term small dollar loans, including payday loans.&#8221; The report discusses the initial findings of the CFPB regarding short-term payday loans, a category which the CFPB and some other regulators use to include certain of our short-term loan products, provided by non-bank financial institutions at storefront locations and deposit account advances offered by depository institutions. While the CFPB&#8217;s study stated that &#8220;these products may work for some consumers for whom an expense needs to be deferred for a short period of time,&#8221; the CFPB also stated that its &#8220;findings raised substantial consumer protection concerns&#8221; related to the sustained use of payday loans and deposit account advances. The report also indicated that the CFPB planned to analyze the effectiveness of limitations such as cooling-off periods between payday loans, &#8220;in curbing sustained use and other harms.&#8221; In furtherance of that report, on March 25, 2014, the CFPB held a hearing on payday lending and issued a report entitled &#8220;CFPB Data Point: Payday Lending,&#8221; presenting &#8220;the results of several analyses of consumers&#8217; use of payday loans.&#8221; The report presents the CFPB&#8217;s findings as to borrowers&#8217; loan sequences, which refers to a series of loans a borrower may take out following an initial loan. The CFPB found that payday borrowing typically involves multiple renewals following an initial loan, rather than distinct loans separated by at least 15 days. The report states that for the majority of loan sequences that last for more than one loan, there is no reduction in the principal amount between the first and last loan in the sequence. In the reports and subsequent statements, the CFPB reiterated its commitment to use its various tools to protect consumers from unlawful acts and practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products and services. Both the April 24, 2013 white paper and the March 25, 2014 report indicated that the CFPB did not include online payday loans as part of its analysis, but the CFPB has indicated that it is currently analyzing borrowing activity by consumers using online payday loans. 

On March 26, 2015, the CFPB published its outline of proposals for regulating high-cost short-term loans, installment loans, open ended lines of credit, and other loans (the &#8220;CFPB Outline&#8221;). The CFPB published the CFPB Outline in preparation for convening a Small Business Review Panel to determine whether its proposal could have a significant economic impact on small businesses and not-for-profits. The CFPB has announced that it is in the late stages of considering the formulation of rules regarding short-term consumer loans that will ensure that consumers can get the credit they need without long-term impact to their financial futures. These rules will likely impose limitations on payday lending. We do not currently know the nature and extent of the rules that the CFPB will adopt or when proposed rules will be published, but the CFPB could propose rules this year with an expected effective date in 2017 or later. For further discussion of the CFPB and its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination authority over our U.S. business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business &#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

On October 7, 2015, the CFPB published its outline of proposals to implement regulations regarding the use of arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer financial services (&#8220;Arbitration Outline&#8221;). The Arbitration Outline seeks to determine the impact of prohibiting class-action waivers and publication of information regarding individual arbitration proceedings. The Arbitration Outline does not include proposed or final rules, and any future rules could be significantly different from those in the Arbitration Outline. The CFPB has not yet defined a date for any proposed rules nor has it defined the effective date for the implementation of final rules, but any final rule would apply to arbitration agreements entered after the final rule becomes effective (and will not apply to prior arbitration agreements). We cannot give any assurances that the effect of such rules will not have a material impact on our U.S. products and services.

&#160;

U.S. State Regulation 

Our consumer lending business is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes, all of which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. As of the date of this report, we offer or arrange consumer loans in 33 states that have specific statutes and regulations that enable us to offer economically viable products. We currently do not offer consumer loans in the remaining states or in the District of Columbia because we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate in those jurisdictions due to specific statutory or regulatory restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings, caps on the fees that may be charged, or costly operational requirements. However, we may later offer our consumer products or services in any of these states or the District of Columbia if we believe doing so may become economically viable because of changes in applicable statutes or regulations or if we determine we can broaden our product offerings to operate under existing laws and regulations. 

The scope of state regulation of consumer loans, including the fees and terms of our products and services, varies from state to state. The terms of our products and services vary from state to state in order to comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. In addition, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to review under various state consumer protection laws and other applicable laws and regulations. The states with laws that specifically regulate our consumer products and services typically limit the principal amount of a consumer loan and set maximum fees or interest rates customers may be charged. Some states also limit a customer&#8217;s ability to renew a short-term consumer loan and require various disclosures to consumers. State statutes often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for short-term consumer loans such as ours and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions. Our collection activities regarding past due amounts are subject to consumer protection laws and state regulations relating to debt collection practices. In addition, some states require certain disclosures or content to accompany our advertising or marketing materials. Also, some states require us to report short-term consumer loan activity to state-wide databases and restrict the number and/or principal amount of loans a consumer may have outstanding at any particular time or over the course of a particular period of time, typically twelve months. 

In Texas and Ohio, where we offer our CSO programs, we comply with the applicable jurisdiction&#8217;s Credit Services Organization Act or a similar statute. These laws generally define the services that we can provide to consumers and require us to provide a contract to the customer outlining our services and the cost of those services to the customer. In addition, these laws may require additional disclosures to consumers and may require us to be registered with the jurisdiction and/or be bonded. 

We must also comply with state restrictions on the use of lead providers. In 2013, California began enforcing its short-term lending statute to require lead providers to be licensed in order to provide leads to licensed lenders. As a result, we have discontinued using lead providers to generate leads for short-term consumer loans in California. In April 2014, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois filed a lawsuit against a lead provider, alleging that the lead provider offered and arranged payday loans without a license. As a result, we discontinued the use of lead providers in Illinois. In December 2015, in a complaint filed in federal court, the CFPB alleged that T3Leads bought and sold personal information from payday and installment loan applications without properly vetting buyers and sellers. Although we cannot predict what measures will be taken, we expect that other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers in the future. 

Over the last few years, legislation that prohibits or severely restricts our consumer loan products and services has been introduced or adopted in a number of states. As a result, we have ceased making consumer loans in five states where we formerly made such loans, and we have also modified our business operations in other states where restrictive legislation has been enacted. Additional legislation or regulations targeting or otherwise directly affecting our products and services have also been recently passed in several states. We regularly monitor proposed legislation or regulations that could affect our business. 

Local Regulation&#8212;United States 

In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, the short-term loan industry is subject to various local rules and regulations. These local rules and regulations are subject to change and vary widely from city to city. Local jurisdictions&#8217; efforts to restrict short-term lending have been increasing. Typically, these local ordinances apply to storefront operations, however, local jurisdictions could attempt to enforce certain business conduct and registration requirements on online lenders lending to residents of that jurisdiction. Actions taken in the future by local governing bodies to impose other restrictions on short-term lenders such as us could impact our business. 

&#160;

International Regulation 

United Kingdom 

In the United Kingdom, we are subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, and must comply with the FCA&#8217;s rules and regulations set forth in the FCA Handbook, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, or the FSMA, the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as amended, or the CCA, and secondary legislation passed under the CCA, among other rules and regulations. We must also follow the Irresponsible Lending Guidance, or the Guidance, of the Office of Fair Trading, or the OFT, which provides greater clarity for lenders as to business practices that the OFT (and now the FCA) believes constitute irresponsible lending under the CCA. 

In December 2012, the U.K. Parliament passed the Financial Services Act 2012, or the FSA Act 2012, which created a new regulatory framework for the supervision and regulation of the consumer credit industry in the United Kingdom. The FSA Act 2012 mandated that, in April 2014, the FCA take over responsibility for regulating consumer credit from the OFT, and it also made changes to the CCA and the FSMA. In January 2016, we received full authorization from the FCA to provide consumer credit and to perform related activities. We will be required to continue to satisfy certain minimum standards set out in the FSMA, which will result in additional costs to us. 

The FCA regulates consumer credit and related activities in accordance with the guidance of the FSMA and the FCA Handbook, which includes prescriptive regulations and carries across many of the standards set out in the CCA and its secondary legislation as well as the Guidance. The FSMA gives the FCA the power to authorize, supervise, examine and bring enforcement actions against providers of consumer credit such as us, as well as to make rules for the regulation of consumer credit. On February 28, 2014, the FCA issued the Consumer Credit Sourcebook, or the CONC, contained in the FCA Handbook. The CONC incorporates prescriptive regulations for lenders such as us, including mandatory affordability checks on borrowers, limiting the number of rollovers on short-term loans to two, restricting how lenders can advertise, banning advertisements that the FCA deems misleading, and introducing a limit of two unsuccessful attempts on the use of continuous payment authority (which provides a creditor the ability to directly debit a customer&#8217;s account for payment when authorized by the customer to do so) to pay off a loan. Certain provisions of the CONC took effect on April 1, 2014, and other provisions for high cost short-term credit providers such as us, such as the limits on rollovers, continuous payment authority and advertising, took effect on July 1, 2014. 

Due to the transfer of the consumer credit regime to the FCA, we made significant modifications to many of our business practices to address the FCA&#8217;s requirements. These modifications included adjustments to our affordability assessment practices and underwriting standards that govern who will qualify for a loan from us, reductions in certain maximum loan amounts, alterations to our advertising practices and adjustments to our collections processes (including our practices relating to continuous payment authority) and debt forbearance processes (or our practices regarding customers who have indicated that they are experiencing financial difficulties), all of which resulted in a significant year-over-year decrease in our U.K. consumer loan volume, U.K. loan balances and U.K. revenue for the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015 as a result of our adapting our U.K. business practices in response to the requirements of the FCA. The implementation of stricter affordability assessments and underwriting standards resulted in a decrease in the number of consumer loans written, the average consumer loan amount and the total amount of consumer loans written to new and returning customers. Additionally, the changes we made to our collections and debt forbearance practices in the United Kingdom could result in lower collection rates on delinquent loans, and we have experienced and will continue to experience an increase in compliance- and administrative-related costs for our U.K. operations. 

In addition, on December 18, 2013, the United Kingdom passed the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act, which included an amendment that required the FCA to introduce rules &#8220;with a view to securing an appropriate degree of protection for borrowers against excessive charges&#8221; on &#8220;high-cost short-term&#8221; consumer loans by January 2, 2015. On July 15, 2014, the FCA issued a consultation paper that proposed a cap on the total cost of high-cost short-term credit and requested comments on the proposal. The consultation paper proposed a maximum rate of 0.8% of principal per day, and the proposal limits the total fees, interest (including post-default interest) and charges (including late fees which are capped at &#163;15) to an aggregate amount not to exceed 100% of the principal amount loaned. The FCA requested comments on the proposal and issued its final rule on November 11, 2014, which became effective on January 2, 2015. The final rule was largely the same as the proposed rule and required us to make changes to all of our high-cost short-term products in the United Kingdom. As a result of the final rule, we discontinued offering line of credit accounts to new customers in the United Kingdom in late 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, we discontinued draws on existing accounts in the United Kingdom. Once U.K. customers have paid off their outstanding line of credit balance, they may be eligible for either a short-term or installment loan. 

On February 24, 2015, the FCA issued a consultation paper that, among other things, proposed to require that providers of high-cost short-term credit include a risk warning in all financial promotions and to amend the FCA rules to allow firms to introduce continuous payment authority to collect repayments where a customer is in arrears or default and the lender is exercising forbearance. The FCA published its response to this consultation on September 28, 2015 and confirmed the ability of firms to use continuous payment authority to collect repayments where a customer is in arrears or default and the lender is exercising forbearance. The FCA also imposed a number of regulatory changes on credit brokers and lenders operating in the high-cost-short-term credit market in the 

&#160;

United Kingdom. The FCA now requires that providers of high-cost short-term credit include a risk warning in all financial promotions, including previously exempted size-limited ads like SMS text messages and pay-per-click ads. The majority of these changes came into force on November 2, 2015. 

The FCA has stated that previous measures taken by it with respect to the payday loan industry will likely force about a quarter of the firms out of the industry in the United Kingdom. For recent developments related to the FCA, including serious concerns that have been expressed by the FCA regarding our compliance with U.K. legal and regulatory requirements, such as the requirement that our business be capable of being effectively supervised by the FCA and compliance with FCA rules and principles and our affordability assessment and debt forbearance practices, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212; Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom have previously expressed serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which has caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that have impacted and will continue to negatively impact our operations and results, and this impact has been and will continue to be significant,&#8221; &#8220;&#8212; The United Kingdom has imposed, and continues to impose, increased regulation of the short-term high-cost credit industry with the stated expectation that some firms will exit the market,&#8221; &#8220;&#8212; Competition regulators in the United Kingdom completed a review of our industry and, as a result of the findings, the FCA is likely to require lenders to implement additional changes to their operations, which could have a negative effect on our operations in the United Kingdom.&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Many U.K. regulatory matters are subject to increased uncertainty because supervision of the U.K. consumer credit regime has recently been transferred to the FCA, which previously did not hold such authority&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

In June 2013, the OFT referred the payday lending industry in the United Kingdom to the Competition Commission, which is now the Competition &#38; Markets Authority, or the CMA, for a market investigation. The CMA has gathered data from industry participants, including us, in connection with its review of the U.K. payday lending industry to determine whether certain features of the payday lending industry prevent, restrict or distort competition (which is also referred to as having an adverse effect on competition) and, if so, what remedial action should be taken. On August 13, 2015, the CMA published its final order which will require online lenders to provide details of their products on at least one price comparison website which is authorized by the FCA once the FCA publishes rules concerning price comparison websites. The CMA will also require online and storefront lenders to provide existing customers with a summary of their cost of borrowing as of August 13, 2016. The CMA will work closely with the FCA to implement the recommendations. On October 28, 2015, FCA issued a consultation paper that, among other things, proposed additional regulations regarding the price comparison website and the summary cost of borrowing statement required by the CMA final order published August 13, 2015. Comments on the proposals were due to the FCA by January 28, 2016.

Furthermore, we are subject to the Bribery Act, which prohibits the giving or receiving of a bribe to any person, including but not limited to public officials, and makes failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations a criminal offense. This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribes anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act is applicable to businesses that operate in the United Kingdom such as us. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in the United States in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the U.S. FCPA.

In the United Kingdom, we are also subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1988, or the DPA, and are required to be fully registered as a data-controller under the DPA. 

On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the so-called &#8220;Safe Harbor&#8221; framework, which previously evidenced compliance with the U.K. Data Protection Act and the European Union Data Protection Directive and allowed companies to pass European Union data to non-European Union countries if certain certification requirements were met by the company. Although many companies, including us, had Safe Harbor certification, the European Union and the United Kingdom provide other guidance regarding compliance with their data protection laws and regulations for companies who pass data outside the European Union. In addition, there are circumstances under which a company is exempt from complying with those laws and regulations. Despite the invalidation of the Safe Harbor framework, we believe we are exempt from and/or in compliance with all E.U. and U.K. privacy laws and regulations. On February 2, 2016, the European Commission and the United States agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows: the &#8220;EU-US Privacy Shield&#8221;, which will replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework. The EU-US Privacy Shield safe harbor will not take effect until the European Commission adopts a formal decision that sets forth the details of how the framework will work and no timeline has been given for when such approval is expected. We expect to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield when finalized; in the interim, we believe we are exempt from and/or in compliance with all E.U. and U.K. privacy laws and regulations.

In the United Kingdom, we are also subject to specific anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing requirements that require us to develop and maintain anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing policies and procedures including reporting suspicious activity to the Serious Organised Crime Agency pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000. 

&#160;

Australia 

In Australia, we must comply with the responsible lending laws under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act (2010), or the NCCPA, which was amended in 2012. The amendment includes limitations on permissible fees and interest charged on certain consumer loans, including consumer loans made by us. Following the 2012 amendment of the NCCPA, we altered the product we offer in Australia and it is less profitable. For discussion of the adverse impact that the amendment to the NCCPA may have on our operations in Australia, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212; Our business in Australia has become less profitable due to compliance with new regulations there, and if our new product offering is not sustainable, this could require us to exit the Australian market&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Canada 

In Canada, regulation of the short-term consumer lending industry is conducted at the provincial level. In general, the regulations require lenders to be licensed, set maximum fees, prohibit rollovers and regulate collection practices. 

In international jurisdictions where we operate, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to regulation under various consumer protection laws and other applicable laws and regulations. 

Separation from Cash America 

Prior to November 13, 2014, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cash America. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of Cash America, after receiving a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, an opinion from Cash America&#8217;s tax counsel and a solvency opinion from an independent financial advisor, approved a tax-free spin-off for our separation. Since 2011, we have owned all of the assets and incurred all of the liabilities related to Cash America&#8217;s e-commerce business, with some limited exceptions, in which case such assets were transferred to us and such liabilities were assumed by us pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement upon completion of the separation and distribution. The distribution occurred at 12:01 am ET on November 13, 2014. Cash America&#8217;s shareholders received 0.915 shares of our stock for every one share of Cash America common stock held at the close of business November 3, 2014, which was the record date for the distribution. Following the separation and distribution, we became an independent, publicly traded company, and our shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;ENVA.&#8221; 

On the separation and distribution date, we entered into several other agreements with Cash America that governed the relationship between us and Cash America after completion of the separation and distribution and provided for the allocation between us and Cash America of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations (including insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities). Our guarantees of Cash America&#8217;s long-term indebtedness were also released in connection with the separation and distribution. These agreements also included arrangements with respect to transitional services to be provided by Cash America to us and vice versa. 

Our Post-Separation Relationship with Cash America

As part of the separation and distribution, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with Cash America to effect the separation and to provide a framework for our relationship with Cash America after the separation and the distribution. These agreements provide for the allocation between us and Cash America of the assets, liabilities and obligations of Cash America and its subsidiaries, and govern various aspects of the relationship between us and Cash America subsequent to the separation, including with respect to transition services, registration rights, tax matters and other commercial relationships. In addition to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which contains key provisions related to the separation and the distribution, these agreements include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Tax Matters Agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Transition Services Agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Stockholder&#8217;s and Registration Rights Agreement; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Software Lease and Maintenance Agreement.
