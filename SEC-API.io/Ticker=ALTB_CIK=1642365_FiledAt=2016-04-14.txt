 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Business Development 

We were incorporated as Alpine Auto Brokers, Inc. on May 12, 2011, in the State of Nevada for the purpose of locating and purchasing used vehicles at auctions, from private individuals, from other dealers and selling these vehicles specifically to consumers primarily located in Salt Lake City, Utah. On January 1, 2014 we acquired 100 percent of the membership interests of Alpine Auto Brokers, LLC, a Utah Limited Liability Company formed on December 10, 2010. We now operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alpine Auto Brokers, LLC. Our dealership and executive offices have been located at 749 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111. We are presently looking for a new location. 

We have focused on selling older model vehicles and a price range of $3,000 to $50,000. Most of the vehicles we sell are priced under $25,000. The majority of our customers have good credit and get their financing from local banks and credit unions. 

&#160; 

We purchase anywhere from 0-6 vehicles a month. 

Our vehicle inventory is usually between 2 to 6 vehicles. We try to have inventory that has low mileage for the year it was manufactured (less than 10,000 miles per year). Our Officer believes that low mileage vehicles sell more easily than high mileage vehicles. 

&#160; 

Used Vehicles 

&#160; 

Consumers who are seeking transportation have a number of options available to them. We compete to sell used vehicles to consumers. Following are some of the advantages for consumers to choose used vehicles over new vehicles. We seek to educate consumers regarding these reasons to further our business goals. 

Affordability 

&#160; 

The purchase price of a used vehicle is significantly less than the purchase price of a new vehicle. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Avoiding Depreciation 

&#160; 

When a new vehicle is driven off the dealership lot, its value will drop significantly in the early years of ownership. A new mainstream vehicle typically loses significant percent of its value in the first two years of ownership. Used vehicles have often already depreciated significantly and, lose additional value at a much slower rate. 

&#160; 

Improving Reliability 

The reliability and durability of vehicles has progressively increased over the years. 

Affordable Options 

&#160; 

Options such as sunroofs and navigation systems are fairly expensive when buying a new vehicle. This definitely applies when dealing with a manufacturer that packages many of them together. When buying used vehicles, a consumer gets more of these options for less money. The buyer may not be able to afford many options on a new vehicle, but they may be able to find a used vehicle with some of the features they are seeking. 

Advantages over Leasing 

&#160; 

Some consumers choose to lease new vehicles rather than buy new or used ones. However, there are disadvantages associated with leasing as well. If consumers do not like the vehicle, there are usually fees involved in the early termination of a lease. Additionally, some leasing companies will require the lessee to pay off the remainder of the vehicle lease contract before releasing them from the lease. Leasing a vehicle can also lead to higher insurance rates since a leased vehicle may require more coverage than a purchased used vehicle. Most leases have a limit on the number of miles the lessee may drive, usually anywhere between 12,000 and 15,000 allowable miles per year. Excessive mileage costs more money. Like mileage, there are limitations on the wear of a vehicle under a lease. Exceeding these wear limitations may result in more fees. Stringent credit requirements for leasing also present an obstacle to many people. 

&#160; 

Used Automobile Dealership Industry 

&#160; 

The economic recession affected nearly every U.S. industry. New automobile dealerships in particular have confronted huge challenges and are striving to adapt and endure in this economy. Used automobile dealerships, however, have realized some major advantages over new automobile dealerships during the past recession. Consumers seeking more value for their money may be discouraged by the high rate of depreciation of new vehicles. Even though the economy has shown signs of improvement, many consumers may avoid buying big-ticket items such as new vehicles. Many consumers are now looking for more practical and less expensive transportation options, and are recognizing the benefits and cost-effectiveness of buying a used vehicle. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

The potential rising demand of increasingly value-conscious consumers for affordable vehicles in Northern Utah might result in what we anticipate will be a highly receptive potential market for our planned growth. Consumers who are now carefully rationing their expenditures are seeking products that will satisfy their need for reasonably priced vehicles. We feel that the high rate of depreciation of new vehicles combined with the increased reliability of used vehicles will also contribute to consumer demand for our products, and support our planned growth. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are a used automobile dealership engaged in the business of purchasing used vehicles at auctions, from private parties, and from other dealers, and selling those vehicles to consumers in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our subsidiary started as a used automobile dealership, known as Alpine Auto Brokers, LLC, in 2010. We have remained in the same location on State Street in Salt Lake City since our inception. We are currently looking for a new location. 

Currently, We have focused on selling older model vehicles in a price range of $3,000 to $50,000. Most of the vehicles we sell are priced under $25,000. The majority of our customers have good credit and get their financing from local banks and credit unions. We do not provide any financing for our customers. 

Presold Vehicles 

&#160; 

Along with selling a retail inventory of vehicles to unknown customers, we also act as a buying agent to assist in locating a vehicle that a known customer would like to purchase from the Manheim networks of automobile auctions. We agree with the customer in advance of the acquisition of the vehicle concerning the amount of mark up of the resale price that will be charged to the customer. When we act as a buying agent for the customer, we have a general inventory risk until the car is sold to a consumer. When we assist a customer with locating a vehicle they would like to purchase, we know the customer&#8217;s identity, and the customer determines which vehicle will be purchased. These sales are called &#8220;presold vehicles.&#8221; 

Marketing and Advertising Methods 

From time to time we advertise on Autotrader.com, Ksl.com, and Craigslist.com. 

Dependence on Major Customers or Suppliers 

We are not dependent on any major customers or suppliers. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

We do not currently have any intellectual property, and we do not have plans to acquire any intellectual property. 

Competition 

We compete with a number of established dealerships who sell used vehicles in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. Some of these companies enjoy brand recognition and a inventory which greatly exceeds that of our brand name. We compete with several dealerships, which have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising, and marketing resources than we do. 

We compete primarily on the basis of quality, and price. We believe that our success will depend upon our ability to remain competitive in our product areas. The failure to compete successfully in the future could result in a material deterioration of customer loyalty and our image and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Employees 

We currently have one employee, our sole officer and director, Jason E. Wilkinson. Our President oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We send all our reconditioning to outside mechanics.
