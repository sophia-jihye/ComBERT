 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

PEN&#8217;s primary business is the marketing and sale of products enabled by nanotechnology. We develop and sell products based on our portfolio of intellectual property. Our current products are a portfolio of nano-layer coatings, nano-based cleaners, printable inks and pastes, and thermal management materials. Additionally, we conduct research and development services for governmental and private customers. 

&#160; 

Our principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities and types of products sold. This is consistent with our internal reporting structure. Our two reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were (i) the Product Segment (which we formerly called the Nanofilm segment) and (ii) the Research and Development Segment. 

&#160; 

Product Segment 

&#160; 

Revenue is based on the successful development of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. Our products are sold in liquid form enabling application by a number of common commercial techniques and in some instances also as wet and dry towelettes. We rely on intellectual property and or trade secret formulations to protect our proprietary technology. 

&#160; 

We have three broad product technology platforms that offer solutions to some common problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging, preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear. All our products have some &#8220;nano&#8221; characteristic about them &#8211; whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness. 

&#160; 

One line of commercial products center on our customized optical and eyewear cleaning and de-fogging treatments. Another is a family of coating liquids that create very thin, strongly-bound, clear coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surfaces. The third product family is series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron size particles to improve abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. Our goal continues to be to create segment leading brands through sales of high quality consumer products, and by developing and producing customized formulas for sale to strategic, industrial partners to be incorporated into their customer&#8217;s products. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Our products encompass: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Liquid and towelette formulations packaged in many formats for retail sale to consumers for eyeglass and sunglass lens cleaning and protection. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Anti-fogging liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including face shields, and sporting googles. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Anti-fogging towelettes for sale to the military for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and other applications such as head&#8217;s up displays, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Mar resistant and stain resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as restaurants, cruise ships, casinos. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Clear protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include automotive and hand held devices. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Protective and water repelling coatings on interior glass &#8211; decorated glass panels, shower doors to make it easy to clean and prevent scale and grime encrustation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Coatings for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses. &#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

New products under development include products targeted to our current customer base in the optical, transportation, military, sports, and safety industries. 

&#160; 

Separate from our historical business, we are also focused on creating products enabled by nanotechnology that tackle and solve big, global problems in growing markets. We have three primary areas of new product focus: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Health: Treating or printing of surfaces at the nano-scale to promote health, fight the spread of disease, and assist in the arms race against super bugs; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Safety: &#8220;Smelling&#8221; at the nano-scale level to identify hazardous condition, alert those in danger, and initiate steps to prevent catastrophe; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using the minimal amounts of safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods, and avoiding using harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible. &#160; 

The first new product is expected to be part of a family of cleaning products that protect and fortify surfaces at the nanoscale-level. The patent-pending product is a spray that penetrates and fortifies the surface. This surface fortifier is safe for use on many surfaces, both natural and man-made. After application, the product continues to fortify and protect, creating a healthy surface. 

&#160; 

Our product is made with safe ingredients and does not use harsh chemicals or disinfectants. We start with a natural mineral that is milled and engineered into a smaller shape and size. Then, the milled mineral is mixed with a proprietary cleaner solution to create our product. The mineral chosen is stable in air and water. No governmental approvals are required for sale of this product. The product: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Rids surface of dust, dirt and debris; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Leaves a healthy surface; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is safe to use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Will continue to work while on the surface; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is fast acting; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is non-corrosive; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is easy to apply; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is non-flammable; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is environmentally-friendly; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is odor-free; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Is stain-free. &#160; 

We believe that our manufacturing capacity and contractors with whom we have established relationships will enable us to fill orders for the early sales. Ingredients and packaging materials are readily available from a number of suppliers. As sales increase, we will need to expand manufacturing, but we believe there are sufficient subcontractors that manufacturing will not be a problem. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We sell our current products directly to retailers in the United States and internationally, including manufacturers who utilize product formulations in their own branded products. For our new products to our traditional customer base, and for certain customers or market segments, we rely on outside sales agents or distributors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Manufacturing Operations 

&#160; 

Most of our manufacturing is done at our 50,000 square foot facility in Valley View, Ohio. Additional manufacturing, packaging and assembly is done by third-party contract manufacturers in the United States, India and Taiwan. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our nanotechnology expertise and related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science, molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, and surfactants. The intellectual property developed from this work is protected with a combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is similar to that used by leading companies in the fragrance and flavors industry. We have twenty four issued patents and two pending patent applications. No single patent is significant to any of our products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Products sold into the optical segment and the eyewear cleaning segments have a small number of significant competitors. Our products are known to be the &#8220;benchmark&#8221; products in these segments and generally outperform our competitors&#8217;. Some of our products in these segments do compete for certain customers or certain applications against lower priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling products into these market segments are privately-held, U.S. packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. are include Hilco Accessories, California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories and, internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China. In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product line we are not aware of any competitive products that match our product performance or processing characteristics. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Sales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified time period, but these agreements do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. The quantities actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer&#8217;s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer&#8217;s delay of a product shipment can make a difference in the results for a particular accounting period. For these reasons we do not believe that these agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts. 

&#160; 

Geographical Information 

&#160; 

All long-lived assets are located in the United States. 

&#160; 

Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers 

&#160; 

We use third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the United States to obtain substantially all of our raw materials, components and packaging products. Over time, one unrelated third party has become our leading supplier in the United States. As is customary in our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers and have generally made purchases through purchase orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers and that there are alternative sources should one or more of these suppliers or manufacturers become unavailable. However, the disruption of our operations if a change becomes necessary and the likelihood of shipment delays means that the loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our key suppliers or manufacturers, or any other supply change disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Key Customers 

&#160; 

A limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue. In particular, revenues from two customers constituted approximately 28% and 11% respectively, of 2015 total revenue. Revenues from three customers constituted approximately 24 %, 16% and 10% respectively, of 2014 total revenue. Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, may be able to exert a high degree of influence over us. The loss of one of the largest customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Segment 

&#160; 

We are a global leader in nanotechnology research and development and this segment focuses on generating revenues through performing research services. Our nanotechnology research is aimed at solving problems at the molecular level - working with the basic properties of matter to create new and improved materials and technologies. We do both research and development, including proof of concepts and prototypes, for proposed PEN products and research and development under contract for government and private entities. In our work on products for PEN we focus on using only the submicron size particles, not smaller nanoparticles that are subject to much greater government regulation. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Nanosensor technology; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Nanoelectronics; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Submicron particle formulations and materials for health and safety products. &#160; 

We continue to focus on stabilizing our financial situation and operating this segment at break-even or better based solely on revenues from our research activities. 

&#160; 

Since development of intellectual property has been a critical part of our strategy, before starting on, or accepting, a project, we analyze the potential to develop intellectual property. Following the Combination, an additional filter has been added and we also consider how the proposed research may tie in to existing products and manufacturing expertise in our Product Segment or to other potential, new products that we may choose to develop. 

&#160; 

Much of our contract research is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done. With private research contracts there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under the contract. Since a critical component of any research contract is for us to retain intellectual property rights, we must contribute to the overall cost of the project. Our goal on private research contracts is, at a minimum, to cover all out of pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead. 

&#160; 

In commercializing our technology, because of limited resources, we historically focused on licensing our technology to others. Our research partners frequently have licensing rights as a result of the research that they funded, and upon completion of the work, they will license the technology for specific applications. Following the Combination we are more focused on developing products that we can sell. We expect that licensing considerations will be less important for new contract research in the future. If we conclude that we are not in a good position to commercialize products from a particular part of our intellectual property portfolio, we may seek to realize value for that intellectual property by license arrangements or the sale of that intellectual property. 

&#160; 

We have had small scale success with commercial sales of conductive inks and pastes and from thermal management materials. We expect to work to increase sales of those products as our resources permit. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Nanoelectronics Applications &#8211; Inks and Pastes 

&#160; 

Metallic Inks &#38; Pastes 

&#160; 

Copper Inks - As a result of the move towards flexible electronics, soldering is disappearing. New digital processes allow industries to move from the design process directly to the production line. We believe that at this time, only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing. 

&#160; 

We have had a long-standing relationship with Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., a leading industrial chemical products company headquartered in Japan, to develop conductive inks that can be deposited using an additive process such as ink-jet printing, aerosol-jet printing or screen printing. Our work with Ishihara started in early 2006 and in past years, we received over $2.5 million in research funding from Ishihara and a $1.5 million up-front license payment. Because of Ishihara&#8217;s heavy financial commitment to the project, all intellectual property generated by the project is jointly owned by ANI and Ishihara and the license agreement signed in 2009 gave Ishihara the exclusive right to use this technology. Ishihara can choose to give up this exclusivity at any time. Ishihara may introduce a product at some point in the future. We may at some point in the future receive royalties of up to 4% on Ishihara product sales. If, however, Ishihara chooses to give up its exclusivity, it will owe no future royalties. 

&#160; 

Other metallic inks - After our initial work in copper, we expanded our work with conductive inks to include nickel, silver, aluminum, and other inks, as well as conductive pastes. In particular, we have developed aluminum and silver inks and pastes that can improve the production of solar cells. We have also developed a highly efficient aluminum paste that can be used in solar cell production. 

&#160; 

In 2014 we amended, agreements with our former licensee Sichuan Anxian Yinhee Construction and Chemical Company (&#8220;YHCC&#8221;), transferring certain solar-ink-related patents to an affiliate of YHCC and receiving back a royalty free license to use the patents in fields other than solar applications. 

&#160; 

There are silver inks on the market today, but because of the high cost of silver relative to copper, a successful copper ink is likely to be of greater commercial interest to potential customers. Most inks and pastes sold today are manufactured and sold by large multinational chemical companies. For example, the two largest suppliers of inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro. We are unable to compete directly with companies of that size in established markets. 

&#160; 

Technical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS) 

&#160; 

Conductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have done extensive research on the raw materials (submicron particles) and developed relationships with suppliers that allow us to supply a variety of submicron particles. In addition, we have studied a variety of potential end user products to help develop specifications for the inks. We have also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes. In addition to traditional 2D printing applications, we developed a multifunctional copper ink for 3D printing applications, the fastest growing segment of printed electronics. 

&#160; 

Numerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive inks and pastes. The commercialization of products using our technology depends on the results of our research compared with results achieved by others, as well as other factors including raw material costs, marketing, resources, and production capabilities. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Sensors 

&#160; 

Our approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. We are pursuing multiple technology platforms to address specific market needs. Our competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas where we are currently active are: 

&#160; 

Ion Mobility Sensors . We are currently developing sensors based on Ion Mobility Sensor (&#8220;IMS&#8221;) technology focusing on Differential Mobility Spectroscopy (&#8220;DMS&#8221;). These sensors are ideal for use when both high sensitivity and high selectivity (low false positives) are required. We have also improved on existing IMS and DMS technology by developing our proprietary nonradioactive gas ionization sources to replace the radioactive isotopes that are currently used in these tools. We are currently involved in projects to develop highly sensitive Mercaptan and Methane sensors for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association, and sensors for detection of citrus greening disease under funding from the California Citrus Research Board and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We have also applied this technology to other applications including other agricultural pathology areas, wound care, and breath analysis. For example, we have received National Institute of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) funding to develop technology for early detection of pressure ulcers (aka bed sores) in collaboration with the University of California &#8211; Davis. We are also funded by the NIH to develop a breath analyzer for detecting alcoholic hepatitis in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic. The U.S. Army funded work to identify pollen based on odor analysis for forensic applications. We also received funding from the USDA for developing rapid tests for food safety. 

&#160; 

Hydrogen Sensors. These sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. We may explore options to realize the value of this sensor technology by sale or license to third parties. 

&#160; 

Carbon Monoxide Sensors. We have developed a low-power carbon monoxide sensor that can last for 10,000 hours on a single battery. The sensor will be specific to carbon monoxide with no cross sensitivity to other gases and elements and is also easily portable and highly sensitive. 

&#160; 

Submicron P article Formulations and Materials for Health and Safety Applications 

&#160; 

Our work in the health and safety area builds on our understanding of certain compounds from our extensive work related to inks and pastes. The understanding of the chemistry of these particles and their interaction with surfactants and other solutions was combined with research and development work done for products already sold commercially resulted in new product concepts and materials with superior properties for applications in the field of health and safety. Using our experience with metallic inks and our prior work with carbon nanotube composites we developed a new thin carbon foil made of layers of graphene for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals used by the medical field in Positron Emission Tomography(PET) imaging 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

An important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and we seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology through the use of patents. Historically, we made filings in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. Beginning in 2014, as a cost saving measure, we became much more selective in filing patents and in the jurisdictions where we act to protect our rights with respect to work that is less likely to result in products that we can sell ourselves. Still, our patent portfolio consists of approximately 75 patents, including issued patents and patent applications pending before foreign and United States Patent and Trademark Offices. Trade secret protection is also important to our products. 

&#160; 

The patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance that our pending United States and foreign applications will issue, or what scope of protection any issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a legal challenge. Interference proceedings, to determine priority of invention, also could arise in any of our pending patent applications. The costs of such proceedings would be significant and an unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings. If we fail to obtain patents, and are required to rely on unpatented proprietary technology, there is no assurance that we can protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technology, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competitors have filed applications for, or have been issued patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, a challenge in the suit by us as to the validity of the other patent would have to overcome a legal presumption of validity. There can be no assurance that the validity of the patent would not be upheld by the court or that, in such event, a license of the patent to us would be available. Moreover, even if a license were available, the payments that would be required are unknown and could materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products. We do, however, consider our patents to be very strong and defendable in any action that may be brought against us. 

&#160; 

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets. 

&#160; 

We require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 

&#160; 

Government Contracts 

&#160; 

A portion of our revenue consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. We recognized $1,187,994 of revenue from government contracts during the year ended December 31, 2015. These reimbursements represent all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2015, we have several government contracts in process that have approximately $928,200 of revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk of cancellation. Also, government contractors generally are subject to various kinds of audits and investigations by government agencies. These audits and investigations involve review of a contractor&#8217;s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs it incurs and its compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and in the future we expect to be audited by the government; however we expect the results of any government audits to have an insignificant effect on our operations and our financial statements. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development activity is the driver of our new product development and improvement of existing products. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company&#8217;s products were $ 744,346 and $607,049 respectively This represents approximately 15% and 13% of our total operating costs in each of those years (prior to an impairment loss in 2015 and 2014). The ability to engineer product performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Research and development work includes development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied both by hand and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing processes and techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer&#8217;s use of the product. As we continued to reduce our costs in 2015, we eliminated some unfunded research and development cost. 

&#160; 

Much of our intellectual property and contract research relates to potential next-generation technologies. Significant additional development work is required before products can be commercialized using these technologies. Since the Combination we have started to analyze which areas in our intellectual property portfolio have a greater, near term potential to be commercialized and whether we, or others, are best suited to do so. That analysis is ongoing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

Our products and manufacturing and research operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and other state and local regulations, including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. Some of our research work, and products developed may also be subject to regulation under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;CDRH&#8221;) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We take these requirements into account in product development. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future. 

&#160; 

OSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can affect timing of sales which may be significant in a particular accounting period. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 we had 38 full-time employees, plus 3 executive officers. At the present time, we do not anticipate the need to hire significant additional employees to support our existing business. If product sales increase, or we begin to see commercial sales of new products, we may hire additional employees. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160;
