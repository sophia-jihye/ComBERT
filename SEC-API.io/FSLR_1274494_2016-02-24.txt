 Item 1: Business 

Company Overview 

We are a leading global provider of comprehensive photovoltaic (&#8220;PV&#8221;) solar energy solutions. We design, manufacture, and sell PV solar modules with an advanced thin-film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell PV solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. Additionally, we provide operations and maintenance (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) services to system owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other third-party manufacturers. We have substantial, ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and system level innovations. We are the world&#8217;s largest thin-film PV solar module manufacturer and one of the world&#8217;s largest PV solar module manufacturers. Our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar energy. 

In addressing overall global demand for PV solar electricity, our differentiated, fully integrated systems business can provide competitively priced utility-scale PV solar energy solutions to system owners and low cost electricity to end-users. Our systems business has enabled us to drive cost reduction across the value chain and deliver compelling solutions to our customers. With our systems business, we believe we are in a position to continue to expand our business in key geographic markets with a compelling need for mass-scale PV electricity. We are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossil-fuel-based peaking power generation. 

In furtherance of our goal of delivering affordable solar electricity, we are continually focused on reducing PV solar power system costs in five primary areas: module manufacturing costs, BoS costs (consisting of the costs of the components of a PV solar power system other than the modules that we manufacture, such as mounting, inverters, cables, tracker equipment, and installation labor costs), project development costs, the cost of capital, and operating costs. First, with respect to our module manufacturing costs, we believe our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale, based on publicly available information. We believe that our module manufacturing cost is competitive, on a comparable basis with, or is lower than, those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. By continuing to improve module conversion efficiency and energy density, increasing production line throughput, and lowering raw material costs, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain cost competitiveness with traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. Second, with respect to our planned BoS cost reduction roadmap, we have aggressive programs which target key improvements in components and system design, which, when combined with continued improvements in module conversion efficiency, volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms, the use of innovative installation techniques and know-how, and accelerated installation times, are expected to result in continued reductions in our BoS costs and drive a lower system levelized cost of energy (&#8220;LCOE&#8221;). Third, with respect to our project development costs, we seek optimal site locations in an effort to maximize solar resources and minimize transmission and permitting costs, and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation. Fourth, with respect to the cost of capital, by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utility-scale PV solar power systems, we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our systems, thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by such systems incorporating our modules and technology. The remaining primary system cost relates to the actual operating costs of a system, which includes the O&#38;M costs of the plant. We believe that our O&#38;M services are an important aspect to further reductions in the LCOE of a PV solar power system through seamless grid integration, increased reliability, and maximization of the availability of the systems we operate and maintain for our customers. 

In addition to enabling the system cost reductions described above, we believe that combining our vertical integration across the value chain enables us to be more competitive, accelerate the adoption of our technology in PV solar power systems, and successfully expand into key geographic markets around the world. Our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and offer valuable benefits such as grid integration and stabilization, thereby positioning us to deliver meaningful PV solar energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide. We seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain, resulting in more reliable and cost effective PV solar energy solutions for our customers, and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity.

Market Overview 

Solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to, and/or substitute for, traditional forms of electricity generation. In recent years, the price of PV solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the retail price of electricity in many markets. The rapid price decline that PV solar energy has experienced in recent years opens new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives. The fact that a PV solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional electricity generation assets. Once installed, PV solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight, compared to traditional forms of electricity generation. In addition to these economic benefits, PV solar has several environmental benefits. For example, PV solar power systems do not generate any greenhouse gas or other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation. Solar markets worldwide continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable to new markets, and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in such markets. 

The solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have, relative to global demand, significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. Additionally, intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers; engineering, procurement, and construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) companies; and vertically-integrated solar companies such as First Solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. In light of such market realities, we are executing our Long Term Strategic Plan, Vision 2020 (&#8220;Long Term Strategic Plan&#8221;) described below, under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths. Such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our differentiated, vertically-integrated business model that enables us to provide utility-scale PV solar energy solutions to key geographic markets with immediate electricity needs. 

Strategy and Competitive Strengths 

To build upon our industry leading position and to remain one of the preferred providers of PV solar energy solutions, we are pursuing the following strategies: differentiation, sustainable growth, and financial viability. 

Differentiation 

&#8226; 

First Solar is vertically integrated across substantially the entire solar value chain. Many of the efficiencies, cost reductions, and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not similarly vertically integrated. The First Solar model offers PV solar energy solutions that benefit from our capabilities, including: project development; engineering and plant optimization; grid integration and plant control systems; advanced PV modules; trackers and fixed mounting systems; procurement and construction consulting; and operations and maintenance services. 

&#8226; 

First Solar systems deliver solar energy that is cost competitive with certain conventional energy sources, depending on the location and application. Our solutions diversify the energy portfolio and reduce the risk of fuel-price volatility, while delivering an LCOE that is cost competitive in some circumstances with electricity generated from fossil fuels. With the absence of commodity price risk, solar energy has a meaningful value proposition, including a long-term fixed price with relatively low operating costs and reliable energy. When compared to the price of power derived from a conventional source of energy, a fixed price cannot be achieved unless the cost of hedging is included. Hedging costs of a commodity such as natural gas, along with the costs of credit support required for a long-term hedge, can significantly increase conventional energy costs. 

&#8226; 

First Solar&#8217;s bankability and financial credibility enable us to offer meaningful module and system warranties after installation, which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to some of our peers in the solar sector in the context of project financing. 

&#32;3 

&#8226; 

We offer one of the most bankable utility-scale solar energy solutions in the world. With our proven experience, financial stability, and ability to maximize the use of our leading technology in debt-financed projects, our bankable energy solutions provide access to capital and relatively low-cost financing to leading utilities and energy investors. 

&#8226; 

First Solar has developed advanced grid integration technology, which provides PV plants the ability to actively stabilize the electricity grid and operate more like traditional electricity generation plants. Advanced plant features of our grid integration systems include the ability to regulate voltage, curtail active power when necessary, limit the rate of change of power, prevent trips during faults and disturbances, and react to changes in grid frequency. 

&#8226; 

First Solar has made significant improvements to BoS components to optimize the entire PV power plant and reduce lifecycle costs. Our proprietary data acquisition, plant control, and mounting systems are examples of plant optimizing technologies that enable us to provide reliable and predictable solar energy, increased energy yields and system availabilities, faster construction velocities, and a lower LCOE. Additionally, our advanced plant controls enable seamless integration of our utility-scale solar plants onto the electricity grid, providing vital grid support services such as voltage and power factor regulation, active and reactive power control, ramp rate control, frequency regulation, and fault ride-through. 

&#8226; 

We invest significant resources in research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), both at the module and system level. First Solar&#8217;s R&#38;D model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration, from advanced research to product development, manufacturing, and applications. Our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent &#32;every year for the last ten &#32;years. First Solar has recently achieved two &#32;new world records for cadmium telluride (&#8220;CdTe&#8221;) PV efficiency, achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 22.1% &#32;and a full area module efficiency of 18.2% . Our module R&#38;D efforts are being focused on continually improving the energy density of our modules and otherwise driving improvements in the lifetime energy production of our modules while simultaneously integrating our module and BoS offerings for cost effective, productive, and reliable PV power plants. 

&#8226; 

In many climates, First Solar&#8217;s CdTe modules provide a significant energy yield advantage over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating. For example, in humid climates, our CdTe modules provide a superior spectral response, and in hot climates, our CdTe modules provide a superior temperature coefficient. As a result, at temperatures above 25&#176;C (standard test conditions), our CdTe modules produce more energy than competing conventional crystalline silicon solar modules with an equivalent efficiency rating. This advantage provides stronger system performance in high temperature climates, which is particularly advantageous as the vast majority of a system&#8217;s generation, on average (in typical high insolation climates), occurs when module temperatures are above 25&#176;C. As a result, our PV solar power systems can produce more annual energy at a lower LCOE than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity. 

&#8226; 

First Solar CdTe PV modules are manufactured in a high-throughput, automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line. At the outset, a sheet of glass enters the production line, and in less than 2.5 &#32;hours it is transformed into a complete PV module, which is flash tested, boxed, and ready for shipment. We currently have 30 &#32;manufacturing lines worldwide and 2.8 GW &#32;of annualized manufacturing capacity. Each line is currently capable of producing approximately 2,500 modules per day; totaling approximately 71,600 modules each day across 30 &#32;lines. About every second, a completed PV module rolls off a First Solar manufacturing line somewhere in the world. With expected increases in module efficiency as per our roadmap, our capacity has a potential to scale up to approximately 3.1 GW in 2017 based on the 30 existing lines. In addition, our stored manufacturing equipment includes up to 8 lines either from our former German factories or from manufacturing facilities that we put on hold with capacity of up to approximately 0.8 GW. As a result, our total available manufacturing capacity includes up to 3.9 GW of either installed or stored capacity that can be readily installed and deployed in production and become a significant enabler of our future growth. In January 2015, we marked a new milestone by achieving over 10 GW of solar capacity installed globally using our CdTe PV modules manufactured to date, making us the first thin-film PV module manufacturer in the world to achieve this milestone. 

&#8226; 

O&#38;M is a key driver for power plants to deliver on their projected revenues. By leveraging our extensive experience in plant optimization and advanced diagnostics, we have developed one of the most advanced O&#38;M programs in the industry. With more than 5.6 GW DC of utility-scale PV plants under the O&#38;M program, we maintain a fleet average system availability greater than 99.5%. Our experienced O&#38;M staff enhances the probability that our customers&#8217; power plants produce the energy predicted in their energy model. Our products and services are engineered to maximize energy output and revenue for our customers while significantly reducing their unplanned maintenance costs. Plant owners benefit from predictable expenses over the life of the contract and reduced risk of energy loss. Our goal is to optimize our customers&#8217; power plants to generate the maximum amount of energy and revenue under their respective power purchase agreements 

&#32;4 

(&#8220;PPA&#8221;) throughout the operational life of the plants. We have made significant investments in O&#38;M technologies in order to develop and create a scalable and sustainable O&#38;M platform. Our O&#38;M program is compliant with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (&#8220;NERC&#8221;) standards and is designed to be scalable to accommodate the growing O&#38;M needs of customers worldwide. We believe our O&#38;M expertise is a significant differentiator, as it is difficult for many competitors to replicate this experience. 

&#8226; 

We manage, as owner or partial owner, project assets to preserve and enhance shareholder value. We provide seamless management of projects from initial land development through construction, commissioning, and operation bringing to bear all of our experience in each of these phases. 

Sustainable Growth 

In executing our Long Term Strategic Plan, we are focusing on providing PV solar energy solutions using our modules to key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale PV electricity, including markets throughout the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As part of our Long Term Strategic Plan, we are focusing on opportunities in which our PV solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an LCOE or similar basis, or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings. Execution of the Long Term Strategic Plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe. This prioritization involves a focus on our core utility-scale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, particularly in the U.S. While it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utility-scale offerings in the next several years, we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. 

We are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets. We have dedicated, and intend to continue to dedicate, significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of PV solar energy, to optimize the design and logistics around our PV solar energy solutions, and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market. We expect that, over time, an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our Long Term Strategic Plan. The timing, execution, and financial impacts of our Long Term Strategic Plan are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. As part of these efforts, we continue to expand or reallocate resources globally, including business development, sales personnel, and other supporting professional staff in target markets. Accordingly, we may shift current costs or incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these target markets. 

Joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our Long Term Strategic Plan, and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers. We also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects. Some of these arrangements involve, and are expected in the future to involve, significant investments or other allocations of capital. We continue to develop relationships with policymakers, regulators, and end customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utility-scale PV solar power systems. We sell such systems directly to end customers, including utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. Depending on the market opportunity, our sales offerings may range from module-only sales, to module sales with a range of development, EPC services, and other solutions, to full turn-key PV solar power system sales. We expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our PV solar energy solutions can best meet our customers&#8217; energy and economic needs. 

Financial Viability 

First Solar&#8217;s commitment is to create long-term shareholder value and generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over that time horizon. Despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to pricing competition and significant capacity in the industry, we have continued to deliver strong financial performance and liquidity. As planned, we expect to continue to drive operating expense efficiencies and improvements while still investing in growth, the continued development of our global sales capabilities, and our R&#38;D roadmap. We seek to balance our incentive compensation and decision-making processes to ensure we direct our efforts and investments towards long-term profitable and sustainable growth with appropriate returns on invested capital and reinvest excess returns back into the business. 

&#32;5 

Offerings and Capabilities 

Offerings 

We are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. We differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution, as needed. Our consultative approach to our customers&#8217; solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals. We have designed our customer solutions according to the needs of the following different business areas. Although we have substantial experience with the utility-scale power plant and advanced PV module offerings described below, certain other offerings are in various stages of development. 

&#8226; 

Utility-Scale Power Plant . We have extensive, proven experience in delivering reliable grid-connected bulk power systems for utility-scale generation. First Solar&#8217;s grid-connected PV solar power systems diversify the energy portfolio, reduce fossil-fuel consumption, reduce the risk of fuel price volatility, and save costs, proving that centralized solar generation can deliver reliable and affordable solar electricity to the grid in many places around the world. Benefits of our grid-connected bulk power system solutions include reduction of fuel imports and improvements in energy security; diversification of the energy portfolio and reductions of risk related to fuel-price volatility; enhanced peaking generation and faster time-to-power; improved grid reliability and stability with advanced PV plant controls; and managed PV variability through accurate forecasting. 

&#8226; 

Advanced PV Modules . Our CdTe PV module outperforms conventional crystalline silicon solar modules with equal power rating due in part to superior spectral response and temperature coefficient in many climates. At temperatures above 25&#176;C, First Solar modules produce more energy than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules with equal nameplate efficiency ratings. Our TetraSun crystalline silicon module is designed for applications where space is at a premium or customers prefer a high power density solution. With a proprietary cell architecture, our crystalline silicon modules offer one of the industry&#8217;s highest power ratings and conversion efficiencies and lowest temperature coefficients, resulting in high energy density in space-constrained installations. 

&#8226; 

Module Plus. &#32;With module plus, we have further enhanced the performance of our industry-leading PV solutions by improving the process of purchasing an integrated module and mounting system. Module plus features the reliability of our advanced thin-film PV modules, paired with a range of specially designed mounting systems that are optimized for accelerated installation and maximum energy return. Accordingly, our module plus customers have access to our advanced PV modules and portfolio of additional system components by leveraging our global supplier network to streamline project logistics and minimize risks through a single system component supplier. 

&#8226; 

Commercial and Industrial . We are in the process of developing system solutions for commercial and industrial applications. We believe the wholesale commercial and industrial market, while in its early stages, is a promising opportunity for First Solar, given our large-scale PV system expertise. A recent example is our announcement in February 2015 that Apple Inc. had committed to purchase electricity from our California Flats solar project under construction in Monterey County, California. Apple will receive electricity from 130 MW AC of the project under a 25-year power purchase agreement, the largest agreement in the industry to provide clean energy to a commercial end user. 

&#8226; 

Community Solar. Our community solar offering addresses the residential and small business sectors, providing a broad range of customers access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops. Community solar utilizes relatively small ground-mounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities, which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource. First Solar&#8217;s expertise in utility-scale generation and module technology, paired with the community solar experience of our partner Clean Energy Collective, allows residential power consumers to &#8220;go solar,&#8221; including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels. We are currently working with strategic partners to develop a commercially scalable community solar offering. 

&#32;6 

Full Suite of Capabilities 

The First Solar model offers PV solar energy solutions with superior value and less risk with our expertise across substantially the entire solar value chain, including: 

&#8226; 

Project Development . During project development, we obtain land and land rights for the development of PV solar power systems incorporating our modules, negotiate long-term PPAs with potential purchasers of the electricity to be generated by those plants or develop plants in regulated markets where feed-in-tariff (&#8220;FiT&#8221;) or similar structures are in place, manage the interconnection and transmission process, negotiate agreements to interconnect the systems to the electricity grid, and obtain the permits that are required prior to the construction of PV solar power systems, including applicable environmental and land-use permits. We also buy projects in various stages of development and continue developing those projects with system designs incorporating our own modules. We sell developed PV solar power systems to utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners, such as investors who are looking for long-term investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns. 

&#8226; 

EPC Services . We provide EPC services to projects developed by us, to projects developed by independent solar power project developers, and directly to system owners such as utilities. EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. Depending on the customer and market need, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities. An example of such combination of individual services would be providing engineering design and procurement of BoS parts (&#8220;EP&#8221; services) for a third-party constructing a PV solar power system. 

&#8226; 

O&#38;M Services . We have a comprehensive O&#38;M service offering covering more than 5.6 GW DC of utility-scale PV solar power systems. Utilizing a state of the art Global Operations Center, our team of O&#38;M experts provide a variety of services to optimize system performance and comply with PPAs, other agreements, and regulations. We offer our O&#38;M services to solar power plant owners that use either our solar modules or modules manufactured by other third-party manufacturers. 

&#8226; 

Tracker and Other Balance of Systems . BoS consists of all of the non-module components of the solar power plant. We sell certain components of the solar system including single-axis trackers, which are manufactured by a third-party using our proprietary technology. We offer several proprietary mounting solutions that have been custom-designed by First Solar engineers to integrate exclusively with our modules and reduce system costs. Project-specific factors such as the local irradiance, weather, soil, wind, and topography will dictate the optimal mounting solution for each project. With a single-axis tracker technology and multiple fixed mounting solutions to choose from, we offer a suite of mounting systems that have been engineered to maximize energy output, increase installation velocity, and reduce costs. Our proprietary tracker systems follow the sun throughout the day to maximize energy output and generate up to 25% more energy than fixed mounting systems. In addition, our vertical integration combined with partner collaboration has enabled us to continue to make system-level improvements, such as PV solar power systems combining our CdTe modules with 1500 volt inverter/transformer systems. 

Global Markets 

We have established and are continuing to develop a localized business presence on six continents, as described below. Energy markets are by their nature localized, with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application. Accordingly, our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our PV solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications. 

The Americas 

&#8226; 

United States. Multiple PV markets in the United States, which accounted for 87% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net sales, exemplify several of the criteria critical for a sustainable solar market: (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas, (ii) high existing power prices, and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with more traditional forms of energy generation. The market penetration of PV solar is impacted by certain state and federal support programs, including the 30% &#32;federal investment tax credit, as described under &#8220;Support Programs.&#8221; We have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing, engineering, constructing, and maintaining utility-scale power plants in the United States, particularly in California and other southwestern states, 

&#32;7 

and increasingly in southeastern states. Currently, our solar projects in the United States account for a majority of the 1.6 GW &#32;AC advanced-stage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct. See Item 7: &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Systems Project Pipeline&#8221; for more information about these projects. 

&#8226; 

Chile. Chile is a promising region for PV solar in that certain markets are characterized by abundant solar resources and potential demand in the form of mining or industrial activity. The Chilean government&#8217;s National Energy Strategy includes expansion of the country&#8217;s renewable energy capacity to 20% &#32;of its total generated power by 2025 . Throughout 2015 , we continued construction of our 141 &#32;MW AC Luz del Norte PV solar power system located near Copiap&#243;, Chile. Energy from the Luz del Norte system will be supplied into the Chilean Central Interconnected System, contributing significantly toward Chile&#8217;s renewable energy goal. Once completed, Luz del Norte will be one of the largest solar systems in the region. We also expect to participate in upcoming auctions for additional PPAs in the region. 

&#8226; 

Other Americas. We are developing our business in other countries in the Americas including Brazil, Mexico, and certain Central American countries. 

Europe, the Middle East, and Africa 

&#8226; 

Europe . While PV solar adoption in prior years was driven to a large degree by feed-in-tariffs and other incentive programs in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, PV solar has entered its next phase in which growth will ultimately be determined by the degree to which PV solar energy solutions can compete economically with more traditional forms of electricity generation, particularly in areas with high prevailing electricity prices, strong electricity demand, and strong solar resources. In particular, Germany, France, and the Netherlands are all running tenders in which large-scale PV solar projects can bid for capacity. 

In Europe, which accounted for approximately 2% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net sales, we have been engaged in business development and module sales activities in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), Germany, France, and the Netherlands, and we are actively evaluating additional sales opportunities in Turkey, Israel, and emerging Southeastern European markets as well as mature Western European solar markets. We are party to a joint venture with Belectric Solarkraftwerke GmbH to develop solar power projects in Europe, North Africa, the United States, and the Middle East. Under the terms of the joint venture, First Solar provides its thin-film modules, selected components, and value-added services, while Belectric provides its advanced balance of systems and a range of service capabilities. Both companies&#8217; engineering, procurement, and construction contributions vary by project and geography. 

&#8226; 

The Middle East. &#32;The solar energy market potential in the Middle East continues to be driven by strong fundamentals, including attractive economics, abundant solar resources, and robust policy. The United Arab Emirates (&#8220;UAE&#8221;), Egypt, and Jordan are important markets for utility-scale solar with indications of future potential coming from Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait. The UAE, Egypt, and Jordan lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the share of renewable energy in their generation portfolios. While their motives for investing in solar energy range from energy security to the diversification of their generation portfolios to the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons, the common factor is that the economics of PV solar have made it a compelling choice as a generation source. 

Jordan and Egypt have actively facilitated the development of the independent power production sector in their countries as a means of responding to urgent energy needs. For example, Jordan has committed to installing 600 &#32;MW of PV solar capacity by 2020 , while Egypt has progressed in its over-subscribed multi-gigawatt solar tender. In the rest of the Arabian Gulf, the region&#8217;s state-owned hydrocarbon companies are becoming more involved in regional solar programs. Examples include initiatives spearheaded by Saudi Aramco, Petroleum Development Oman, and the Kuwait Oil Company. However, as with any emerging market, challenges remain and these are primarily related to evolving policy and legislation, prevailing energy subsidies, infrastructure, the availability of financing, the level of competition, and geopolitical risk. 

&#160; 

Since establishing a presence in the Middle East in 2013 , First Solar has focused on the region&#8217;s utility-scale segment while pursuing a range of opportunities. In addition to constructing the 13 &#32;MW DC first phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, First Solar will also be supplying the modules for the Park&#8217;s 200 &#32;MW AC second phase. In Jordan, First Solar is constructing the 53 &#32;MW AC Shams Ma&#8217;an PV solar power system, which is expected to account for approximately 1% &#32;of Jordan&#8217;s annual energy output upon completion in 2016 . Additionally, First Solar has provisionally been allocated 50 &#32;MW in Egypt&#8217;s Feed-in-Tariff program. As a result of these and other projects, First Solar expects to be the leading provider of PV solutions in the Middle East, with a projected installed capacity of at least 271 &#32;MW across the region by 2017 . 

&#32;8 

&#8226; 

Africa . Africa offers strong potential for PV solar, which can play a useful role in meeting the region&#8217;s varying energy needs. Our focus in the region is primarily the sale of modules and BoS components for utility-scale projects. In South Africa, the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender process in support of a target of procuring over 18 &#32;GW of renewable energy (wind, solar, etc.) by 2030 &#32;as part of South Africa&#8217;s Integrated Resource Plan of which over 9.4 &#32;GW was allocated to PV solar. Additionally, we are working with our channel partners, such as Caterpillar Inc., to provide hybrid diesel and/or PV solutions to the mining industry in the region. Whether mines are grid-connected or relying on diesel generators, solar energy, with its cost competitiveness and reliability, represents a meaningful value proposition for the industry. Deploying PV hybrid solutions that supplement existing power sources, such as the electricity grid or diesel generators, can help mining companies address their daytime electricity supply challenges, while minimizing costs and reducing environmental impacts. 

Asia-Pacific (&#8220;APAC&#8221;) and India 

&#8226; 

Australia. &#32;Australia is a promising region for PV solar. The Australian PV solar market is expected to experience growth in 2016 &#32;after a pause in new development activity in 2014 &#32;and 2015 . In Australia, which accounted for approximately 5% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net sales, the solar industry was adversely impacted during 2014 &#32;and 2015 &#32;by regulatory uncertainty related to an extended review of the federal government&#8217;s national Renewable Energy Target (&#8220;RET&#8221;) and potential de-funding of the federal government&#8217;s Australia Renewable Energy Agency and Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which offer grant-based funding for PV solar projects in both grid-connected and off-grid applications. In June 2015 , the federal government announced a compromise position on the RET, setting a target of 33,000 &#32;gigawatt hours by 2020 . In addition to federal government support, numerous state and territory governments have announced their own support programs. In particular, the Australian Capital Territory announced a reverse auction for utility-scale PV projects, the Queensland government announced PPA support for up to 60 &#32;MW of utility-scale PV projects, and the Victorian government announced plans to support renewable energy. In 2015 , First Solar retained the title of Australia&#8217;s largest PV EPC and O&#38;M company. First Solar also completed commissioning of the Nyngan and Broken Hill solar projects ( 102 &#32;MW and 53 &#32;MW, respectively), which are the largest solar plants in Australia. 

&#8226; 

Japan. Japan has evolving electricity market characteristics, particularly after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which make it an attractive market for PV solar. One such characteristic is the announcement of new safety standards following the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, which resulted in the idling of Japan&#8217;s nuclear reactors, which had historically generated nearly 30% &#32;of the country&#8217;s electricity. Japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports. Accordingly, the Japanese government has announced a long-term goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and has provided various incentives for solar power installations. As a result, strong solar demand is expected in Japan over the next several years. 

In 2015 , we completed the construction of three &#32;PV solar power systems and commenced the construction of four &#32;additional systems. We have also acquired the rights to a 59 &#32;MW AC PV solar project in Japan, which is expected to use our CdTe PV modules and begin construction in 2016 . We are partnering with local companies to develop, construct, and operate PV solar power systems, which will further mitigate Japan&#8217;s dependence on nuclear power and fossil fuel imports. Our sales offerings in Japan include both our CdTe modules and high-efficiency crystalline silicon modules as well as O&#38;M services. 

&#8226; 

India. &#32;There is significant potential for PV solar in India due to its growing energy needs, substantial population centers, lack of electrification to many parts of the country, high energy costs, strong irradiance, and aggressive renewable energy targets set by the government, which include increasing the country&#8217;s solar capacity to 100 &#32;GW by the year 2022 . To support this initiative, several key electricity regulations have been announced relating to ramping up renewable purchase obligations, implementing penal provisions for non-compliance with the obligations under the Indian Electricity Act, budgetary allocations under the Central Government for establishing the Green Transmission Corridor, and the creation of numerous solar parks in various states with dedicated transmission infrastructure to be installed by the government. In addition to these measures, the Central Government also introduced the Renewable Generation Obligations, which will mandate that all thermal power generators must implement new renewable energy generation capacity to match 10% &#32;of their new thermal generation capacity. Overall, these policy and regulatory measures have been introduced with an objective of creating significant and sustained demand for PV solar in India. Accordingly, we are working to sell modules and develop utility-scale PV solar projects in India to address the energy and renewable purchase obligation needs of utilities and target the open access industrial and commercial power demand. 

&#32;9 

In 2015 , we secured rights through a competitive auction to sell power under a 25 -year PPA for a cumulative capacity of 75 &#32;MW AC to the state owned electricity distribution companies in Telangana. We also have 125 &#32;MW AC of existing projects, for which PPAs were secured in 2014 . In 2015 , we successfully achieved commercial operation of 20 &#32;MW AC of our project pipeline and commenced development or construction on 180 &#32;MW AC of the remaining pipeline, which is expected to achieve commercial operation during 2016 . We continue to maintain our PV module market leadership in India with over 1,000 &#32;MW DC of installed modules. 

&#8226; 

Other APAC. We are developing our business in other APAC countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Each of these regions has one or more market characteristics or trends (such as an environment of declining fuel subsidies in Indonesia) which can make PV solar electricity attractive. In China, we continue to evaluate our options and remain committed to our presence, with the goal of developing sales opportunities in the market. 

Support Programs 

Although our Long Term Strategic Plan provides for First Solar to compete in key markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, in the near term our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. Support programs for PV solar electricity generation, depending on the jurisdiction, include FiTs, quotas (including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems), and net energy metering programs. In addition to these support programs, financial incentives for PV solar electricity generation include tax incentives, grants, loans, rebates, and production incentives. Although we expect to become less impacted by, and less dependent on, support programs as we execute our Long Term Strategic Plan, support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of PV solar systems around the world. 

In Europe, renewable energy targets, in conjunction with FiTs, Renewable Obligation Certificates, and other schemes such as tenders for utility-scale PV solar, have contributed to the growth in PV solar markets. Renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources, while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors. A 2009 &#32;European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) directive on renewable energy, which replaced an earlier 2001 &#32;directive, sets varying targets for all EU member states in support of the directive&#8217;s goal of a 20% &#32;share of energy from renewable sources in the EU by 2020 , and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources. 

Tax incentive programs exist in the U.S. at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements. At the federal level, investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980&#8217;s. In December 2015 , the U.S. Congress extended the 30% &#32;federal energy investment tax credit (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) for both residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019 . The credit will step down to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and remain at 10% &#32;permanently beginning in 2022 . The ITC has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the U.S., and its extension is expected to contribute to greater medium-term demand visibility in the U.S. The positive impact of the ITC has depended to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing, and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing. The eventual step-down of the ITC to 10% &#32;underscores the need for the LCOE from solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation. 

At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s adoption of a final Clean Power Plan Rule (the &#8220;Rule&#8221;) and implementation of the Rule through state plans offered the possibility of increasing the demand for PV solar generating capacity in certain regions of the U.S. in which PV solar has not historically received significant state-level policy support. However, the adoption and implementation of the Rule has been impacted by litigation against the Rule initiated by states and other stakeholders which has not yet been resolved, and in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Rule while such legal challenges are pending. It is therefore premature to assess what the effects of the Rule will be on PV solar markets. 

The majority of states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standard (&#8220;RPS&#8221;) mechanisms. Under an RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, such as solar generating facilities, by a specified date. Some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities. RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state&#8217;s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for RPS compliance. Measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its RPS mandate, California&#8217;s RPS program is the most significant in the U.S., and the California market for renewable energy has dominated the western U.S. region for the 

&#32;10 

past several years. First enacted in 2002 , California&#8217;s RPS statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance. Pursuant to amendments enacted by the California Legislature in 2015 , the California RPS program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50% &#32;of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030 . In 2015 , approximately 60% &#32;of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or third-party module sales to solar power systems in California. 

Business Segments 

We operate our business in two &#32;segments. Our components segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity. We primarily manufacture CdTe modules and also manufacture high-efficiency crystalline silicon modules. Third-party customers of our components segment include integrators and operators of PV solar power systems. Our second segment is our fully integrated systems business (&#8220;systems segment&#8221;), through which we provide complete turn-key PV solar power systems, or solar solutions, that draw upon our capabilities, which include (i) project development, (ii) EPC services, and (iii) O&#38;M services, as described in more detail below. We may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity. All of our systems segment products and services are for PV solar power systems, which primarily use our solar modules, and we sell such products and services to utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. Additionally, within our systems segment, we may own and operate certain of our PV solar power systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities. 

See Note 23 &#32; &#8220;Segment and Geographical Information &#8221; &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our business segments. 

Components Business 

Our components business involves the design, manufacture, and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity. 

Solar Modules 

CdTe Modules. &#32;Our flagship module since the inception of First Solar has been manufactured using our advanced CdTe thin-film technology. Each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft (60cm x 120cm) in size that encapsulates a CdTe thin-film semiconductor. Our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 107 watts , 95 watts , and 91 watts &#32;for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. During 2014, we announced the release of our Series 4 TM &#32;module, which offers up to 8% &#32;more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same efficiency rating, and is compatible with advanced 1500-volt plant architectures. The Series 4A TM &#32;variant features a new anti-reflective coated glass, which enhances energy production. Our semiconductor structure is a single-junction polycrystalline thin-film that uses CdTe as the absorption layer. CdTe has absorption properties that are matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. One of the drivers of First Solar modules&#8217; performance advantage over traditional crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient, delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperatures typical of utility-scale solar power plants in sunny regions. 

Crystalline Silicon Modules. &#32;In addition to our primary CdTe module technology, we also manufacture crystalline silicon modules made from high-efficiency N-Type Mono cells produced at our facility in Kulim, Malaysia and then assembled into a 60 or 72 cell module by third-party contract manufacturers. When fully ramped, we expect the facility to have the capacity to produce 55,000 156mm cells per day for a nameplate capacity of 100 MW annually. The standard First Solar 60 cell PV module will have a power rating of 300 watts. Accordingly, our crystalline silicon technology is expected to deliver a very high efficient cell at a much lower manufacturing cost than is currently available in the marketplace. 

Descriptions below of our components business relate to our CdTe modules unless otherwise noted. 

Manufacturing Process 

CdTe Modules. We manufacture our CdTe solar modules on high-throughput integrated production lines in an automated, proprietary, and continuous process. Our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. Our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time-consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia manufacturing facilities. 

&#32;11 

We have integrated our CdTe manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages: the deposition stage, the cell definition and treatment stage, and the assembly and test stage. In the deposition stage, panels of transparent oxide-coated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned, laser etch identified with a serial number, heated, and coated with thin layers of CdTe and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology, after which the semiconductor-coated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength. In the cell definition and treatment stage, we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output. In this stage, we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance, and we apply a metal terminated sputtered back contact. Finally, in the assembly and test stage, we apply busbars, inter-layer material, and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device. A junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly. The final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing. 

We maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and internal standards are met. Acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator are conducted prior to a module being boxed for shipment. The quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program, subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission (&#8220;IEC&#8221;) and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (&#8220;UL&#8221;). These programs assure a high level of product quality and reliability, helping to deliver power performance in the field. 

Crystalline Silicon Modules. We manufacture our crystalline silicon cells at our facility in Kulim, Malaysia. The manufacturing process starts with 156mm &#32;N-Type mono-crystalline silicon wafers supplied by a variety of wafer suppliers. Incoming wafers are subjected to a series of inspections to ensure that high quality standards are met. The proprietary manufacturing process consists of passivation, annealing, metalization, printing, wet cleans, and electroplating steps and are all fully automated independent steps. Completed cells are tested and binned according to strict performance criteria. The final module assembly is completed by a contract manufacturing company that performs manufacturing to our module specifications using a bill of materials managed by us. 

We maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure that industry and internal standards are met. This rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator. The quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program, subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to IEC and UL requirements. This program assures a high level of product quality and reliability, helping to predict power performance in the field. 

Research, Development, and Engineering 

We continue to devote substantial resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the lifecycle cost of electricity generated by our PV solar power systems. We conduct our research and development activities primarily in the United States. Within our components business, we focus our research and development activities on, among other areas, continuing to increase the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules and continuously improving durability and manufacturing efficiencies, including throughput improvement, volume ramp, and material cost reduction. 

In the course of our research and development activities, we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules. We typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines. We believe that our systematic approach to technology change management will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines. In addition, our CdTe production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and, as a result, a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines. 

We regularly produce research cells in our laboratories, some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell at standard test conditions. Our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability. We believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential long-term module efficiency entitlement of over 19% &#32;using our commercial-scale manufacturing equipment. 

&#32;12 

In 2013 , we acquired GE&#8217;s global CdTe solar intellectual property portfolio, setting a course for significant advancement of our PV thin-film solar technology. The combination of the two companies&#8217; complementary technologies and First Solar&#8217;s existing manufacturing capabilities have accelerated the development of CdTe solar module performance and improved efficiency at a manufacturing scale. In addition, GE Global Research and First Solar R&#38;D are collaborating on future technology development to further advance CdTe solar technology pursuant to an agreement through 2016 . 

For information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , See Item 7: &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Customers 

&#160; 

With respect to our components business, during 2015 , we sold the majority of our solar modules (not included in our systems projects) to integrators and operators of systems in India and Great Britain. Third-party module sales represented approximately 6 % of our total 2015 &#32;net sales. Additionally, we develop, design, construct, and sell PV solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture. 

During 2015 , Southern Power Company , Strata Solar, LLC , and NextEra Energy, Inc. &#32;individually accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our components segment&#8217;s net sales, which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects. We are investing in key geographic markets, particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, and as part of such efforts, we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships, which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence. 

Competition 

The renewable energy, solar energy, and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry. We face intense competition for sales of solar modules, which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share. With respect to our components business, our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thin-film module manufacturers. Certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. Certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. Among PV module and cell manufacturers, the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt, conversion efficiency, energy yield, reliability, warranty terms, and customer payment terms. If competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2015 , the global PV industry consisted of more than 150 &#32;manufacturers of solar modules and cells. In the aggregate, these manufacturers have, relative to global demand, significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 

In addition, we expect to compete with future entrants into the PV solar industry that offer new technological solutions. We also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce PV solar cells, solar modules, or turn-key production lines. We also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies (including wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and tidal technologies) and other power generation sources that employ conventional fossil fuels. 

Raw Materials 

Our CdTe module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module. One critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride. Of the other raw materials and components, the following are also critical to our manufacturing process: front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide, other semiconductor materials, organics such as photo resist, tempered back glass, packaging components such as interlayer, cord plate/cord plate cap, junction box, lead wire, and solar connectors. Before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process, a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process. We continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials. When possible, we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations, reducing the cost and lead times for such materials. A few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers. 

&#32;13 

CdTe Solar Module Collection and Recycling Program 

First Solar is committed to extended producer responsibility and takes into account the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle. We established the solar industry&#8217;s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program. First Solar&#8217;s module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials, including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material, for use in new modules or other new products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives. Approximately 90% of each collected First Solar module can be recycled into materials for use in new products, including new solar modules. 

First Solar&#8217;s recycling services provide plant owners with flexibility in determining end-of-life module disposition. For modules sold under sales arrangements covered under our Solar Module Collection and Recycling Program (&#8220;the program&#8221;), we include a description of our module collection and recycling obligations. For such modules covered under the program, we agree to cover the costs for the collection and recycling of solar modules, and the end-users agree to notify us, disassemble their systems, package the solar modules for shipment, and revert module ownership rights back to us at the end of the modules&#8217; service lives. 

The European Union&#8217;s Waste Electronics and Electrical Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;) Directive places the obligation of recycling (including collection, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal) of electrical and electronic equipment (&#8220;EEE&#8221;) products upon producers. The WEEE Directive is now applicable to PV solar modules in EU member states. For modules covered under our pre-funded program that were previously sold into and installed in the EU, we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program. In addition, as a result of the transposition of the WEEE Directive by the EU member states, we will be adjusting our offering in the various EU member states as required to ensure compliance with specific EU member state WEEE regulations. 

In addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits, our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process. We currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our current manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Malaysia and at our former manufacturing facility location in Germany that produce glass cullet suitable for use in the production of new glass products by a third-party supplier and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a third-party supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules. 

Solar Module Warranties 

We provide a limited PV solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 &#32;years following the transfer of title to our modules. We also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 97% &#32;of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.7% &#32;every year thereafter throughout the 25 -year performance warranty period. Prior to 2014 , we warranted that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications would produce at least 90% &#32;of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 &#32;years following installation and at least 80% &#32;of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 &#32;years. In resolving claims under both the defect and power output warranties, we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or, under the power output warranty, providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall. We also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of modules to resolve the claims. Such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale. 

As an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer an aggregated or system level limited module performance warranty. This system level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25 -year system level energy degradation protection. In addition, this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. The system level limited module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system&#8217;s expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% &#32;during the term of the warranty. In resolving claims under the system level limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels, we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance; we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules, providing supplemental modules, or making a cash payment. Consistent with our limited module power output warranty, when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty, we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules. 

&#32;14 

From time to time, we have taken remediation actions with respect to affected modules beyond our limited warranty, and we may elect to do so in the future, in which case we would incur additional expenses. Such potential voluntary future remediation actions beyond our limited warranty obligation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we commit to any such remediation actions. 

Systems Business 

Through our fully integrated systems business, we provide complete turn-key PV solar power systems, or solar solutions, which may include project development, EPC services, and/or O&#38;M services. 

Project Development 

Project development activities include: site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site, obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies, executing an interconnection agreement, obtaining environmental and land-use permits, maintaining effective site control, and entering into a PPA with an off-taker of the power to be generated by the project. These activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a PV solar power system. Depending on the market opportunity or geographic location, we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process, construct a system incorporating our modules, and sell the system to a long-term owner. We may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities. Depending on the type of project or geographic location, PPAs or FiT structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from the project. Entering into a PPA generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting, beginning construction, arranging financing, and marketing the project for sale to a long-term owner. Depending primarily on the location, stage of development upon our acquisition of the project, and other site attributes, the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but can be as long as five years. We may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, we may be forced to incur additional costs, write-down capitalized project assets, and the right of the off-taker under the PPA to terminate may be triggered. 

EPC Services 

EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. We provide the majority of our EPC services to our self-developed projects intended to be sold; however, we also provide EPC services to projects developed by independent solar power project developers, and directly to system owners such as utilities. Depending on the customer and market need, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities. 

For PV solar power systems built by us, we typically provide a limited product warranty on BoS parts for defects in engineering design, installation, and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system. In resolving claims under such BoS warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement. 

As part of our systems business, we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the EPC agreement. In addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first year of a system&#8217;s operation. Such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. These adjustments include factors, such as irradiance, weather, module degradation, soiling, curtailment, and other conditions that may affect a system&#8217;s energy output but are unrelated to the quality, design, or construction. 

&#32;15 

O&#38;M Services 

Our typical O&#38;M service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a PV solar power system. We perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract. These activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with PPAs, other agreements, and regulations. Although the scope of our services may vary by contract, our O&#38;M service arrangements generally include 24/7 system monitoring, certain PPA and other agreement compliance, North American Electric Reliability Corporation compliance, Large Generator Interconnection Agreement compliance, energy forecasting, performance engineering analysis, regular performance reporting, turn-key maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair, warranty management, and environmental services. As part of our O&#38;M services, we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider, such as weather, curtailment, outages, force majeure, and other conditions that may affect system availability. 

Customers 

With respect to our systems business, our customers consist of utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. These customers may purchase completed PV solar power systems, which include our solar modules, or any combination of development, EPC services, and O&#38;M services. During 2015 , the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in North America, and the principal customers of our systems business were NextEra Energy, Inc. &#32;and Southern Power Company , each of which also accounted for more than 10% &#32;of the segment&#8217;s net sales. 

Competition 

With respect to our systems business, we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions, including developers of PV solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects, including wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and tidal projects. To the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated, we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well. We also face competition from other EPC companies and joint venture type arrangements between EPC companies and solar companies. Certain current or potential future competitors may also have a low cost of capital and/or access to foreign capital. While the decline in PV module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide, there are limited barriers of entry in many parts of the PV solar value chain, depending on the geographic market. Accordingly, competition at the systems level can be intense, thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry-wide, to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and PPAs, using low cost assumptions for modules, BoS components, installation, maintenance, and other costs. Please see Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Competition at the systems level can be intense, thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry-wide, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations. &#8221; 

Research, Development, and Engineering 

Our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the LCOE through reductions in BoS costs, improved system design, and energy yield enhancements associated with PV solar power systems that use our modules. These R&#38;D efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid reliability. We conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the United States. Innovations related to system design, hardware platforms, inverters, trackers, and installation techniques and know-how, among other things, can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce BoS costs, which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale PV solar power system. 

For information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , see Item 7: &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Own and Operate 

From time to time, we may temporarily own and operate certain PV solar power systems, often with the intention to sell at a later date. The ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process, provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a system, and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets. As an owner and operator for certain of these systems, we may be subject to the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;), as well as various other local, state, and federal regulatory bodies. For more information about risks related to owning and operating PV solar power systems, please see Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; As an 

&#32;16 

owner and operator of PV solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid, certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under U.S. federal and state law, which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth. &#8221; For more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see Item 7: &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as associate and third-party confidentiality agreements, to safeguard our intellectual property. We regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. Our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable. In addition, we have registered and/or have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for &#8220;First Solar&#8221; and &#8220;First Solar and Design.&#8221; 

With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on, among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our PV module manufacturing process, including our unique materials sourcing, involve proprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. Our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions, designs, and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules, technology, or business plans. 

We have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims. 

Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters 

Our operations include the use, handling, storage, transportation, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. We are subject to various national, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the use, management, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, occupational health and safety, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or non-compliance with environmental permits required for our operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future. However, future developments such as the implementation of new, more stringent laws and regulations, more aggressive enforcement policies, or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability. &#8221; 

Corporate History 

In February 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;FSLR&#8221; since our initial public offering in November 2006. In October 2009, our common stock was added to the S&#38;P 500 Index, making First Solar the first, and currently only, pure-play renewable energy company in the index. 

Associates 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 6,350 &#32;associates (our term for full and part-time employees), including approximately 4,760 &#32;in module manufacturing positions and approximately 560 &#32;associates that work directly in our systems business. The remainder of our associates are in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions. None of our associates are currently represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As we expand domestically and internationally, we may encounter either regional laws that mandate union representation or associates who desire union representation or a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good. 

&#32;17 

Information About Geographic Areas 

We have significant marketing, distribution, and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia manufacturing facilities. 

In 2015 , the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was Australia, which accounted for 5% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. As part of our Long Term Strategic Plan, we are in the process of expanding our operations to various countries across the world, including countries in the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result, we are subject to the legal, tax, political, social, regulatory, and economic conditions of an increasing number of foreign jurisdictions. The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor, and tax conditions in foreign countries &#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We may be unable to fully execute on our Long Term Strategic Plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. &#8221; See Note 23 &#32; &#8220;Segment and Geographical Information &#8221; &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.
