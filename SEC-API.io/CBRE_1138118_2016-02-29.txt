 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the &#147;company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our&#148;), is the world&#146;s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate. As of December 31, 2015, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 400 offices worldwide, with more than 70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the &#147;CBRE&#148; brand name, investment management services under the &#147;CBRE Global Investors&#148; brand name and development services under the &#147;Trammell Crow Company&#148; brand name. 

&#160; 

Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research. We generate revenues from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve property and facilities management, mortgage loan servicing, investment management and appraisal/valuation. In addition, our leasing services have contractual elements and work for clients in this service line is often recurring in nature. Our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet their broad needs in local markets nationally and globally. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of this business. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. We have been included in the Fortune 500 since 2008 and among the Fortune Most Admired Companies in the real estate sector for four consecutive years. In 2015, we were ranked second among all companies on the Barron&#146;s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance. Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years. 

&#160; 

CBRE History 

&#160; 

CBRE marked its 109th year of continuous operations in 2015, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services and investment firm (in terms of 2015 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions. Among these acquisitions are the purchases of Trammell Crow Company (December 2006); ING Group N.V.&#146;s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia (October 2011) and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (July 2011); and Norland Managed Services Ltd (December 2013). In addition, CBRE acquired the Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business from Johnson Controls, Inc. in September 2015. GWS is a leading provider of enterprise facilities management services worldwide. 

&#160; 

Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services 

&#160; 

CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries. CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness. 

&#160; 

We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; (3) Asia Pacific; (4) Global Investment Management; and (5) Development Services. 

&#160; 

Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in &#147;Segment Operations&#148; within the &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section and within Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

The Americas 

&#160; 

The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America. Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliates to whom we license the &#147;CBRE&#148; name in their local markets in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate. 

&#160; 

Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc. Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or Capital Markets, and its subsidiaries. Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited and our operations in Latin America are operated through various indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Our Americas segment accounted for 57.0% of our 2015 revenue, 57.5% of our 2014 revenue and 62.7% of our 2013 revenue. Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into several business lines, as further described below. 

&#160; 

Advisory Services 

&#160; 

Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including: (1) real estate leasing services; (2) capital markets; and (3) valuation. Our advisory services business line accounted for 31.1% of our 2015 consolidated worldwide revenue, 32.5% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue and 34.8% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue. 

&#160; 

Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Real Estate Leasing Services . We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing (the majority of our revenues), disposition and acquisition of property. We generate significant repeat business from existing clients, which, for example, accounted for approximately 64% of our U.S. sales and leasing revenue in 2015, including referrals from other parts of our business. We believe we are a market leader for the provision of real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix. 

&#160; 

Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment. This gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect of compensation, our largest expense, on our operating margins during difficult market conditions. We strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as greater investments in support resources, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing, than most other firms in our sector. 

&#160; 

We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Capital Markets. We offer clients fully integrated investment sales and debt/structured financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand. The tight integration of these services helps to meet marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions. During 2015, we concluded approximately $128.6 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $88.7 billion of investment sales transactions and $39.9 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales. 

&#160; 

CBRE is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16.5% in 2015 across office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties according to Real Capital Analytics. Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies. In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2015 was $33.7 billion, including approximately $12.6 billion for U.S. federal government-sponsored entities (GSEs). Most of the GSE loans were financed through our revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose and were substantially risk mitigated by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the GSE or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan. We advised on the sale of approximately $5.7 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2015. CBRE also operates a loan servicing portfolio, which totaled approximately $108.9 billion in the Americas at year-end 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Valuation . We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility and fairness opinions as well as consulting services such as property condition reports, hotel advisory and environmental consulting. Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provide us with an advantage over our competitors. We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry. During 2015, we completed over 53,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas. 

&#160; 

Outsourcing Services 

&#160; 

The outsourcing of commercial real estate services is believed to be a long-term trend in our industry, with property owners and occupiers seeking better execution and improved efficiency by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists. Two of our business lines capitalize on the outsourcing trend: (1) occupier outsourcing, which we provide for corporations, public sector entities, health care providers and others; and (2) asset services, which we provide for property owners. As of December 31, 2015, we managed approximately 2.3 billion square feet of commercial property and facilities in the Americas. Our outsourcing services business line accounted for 25.9% of our 2015 consolidated worldwide revenue, 25.0% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue and 27.9% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Occupier Outsourcing. Through our Global Workplace Solutions business line, we provide a comprehensive suite of services to occupiers of real estate, including facilities management, project management, advisory and transaction services and strategic consulting. We typically enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis. Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, distribution facilities and retail space. Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied. Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis. Revenues for project management generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met. Revenues for project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Asset Services. We provide asset services (also called property management services) on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties. These services include construction management, marketing, building engineering, accounting and financial services. We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain 

&#160; 

&#160; cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee. We are also often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management. Our management agreements with our asset services clients, which are owners/investors in real estate, may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and the typical contract continues for multiple years. We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including leasing, refinancing, disposition and appraisal. 

&#160; 

Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 

&#160; 

Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment operates in 43 countries. The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector. Additionally, we provide some residential property services, focused on the prime and super-prime segments of the market, primarily in the United Kingdom. Within EMEA, our services are organized along similar lines as in the Americas, including leasing, property sales, valuation services, asset management services and occupier outsourcing, among others. Our EMEA segment accounted for 27.7% of our 2015 revenue, 25.9% of our 2014 revenue and 16.9% of our 2013 revenue. 

&#160; 

In several countries in EMEA, we have contractual relationships with independent affiliates that provide commercial real estate services under our brand name. Our agreements with these independent affiliates include licenses by us to them to use the &#147;CBRE&#148; name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us. In addition, these agreements may include business cross-referral arrangements between us and our affiliates. 

&#160; 

Asia Pacific 

&#160; 

Our Asia Pacific reporting segment operates in 14 countries. We believe that we are one of only a few companies that can provide a full range of real estate services to large occupiers and investors throughout the region, similar to the broad range of services provided by our Americas and EMEA segments. Our primary operations in Asia are located in Greater China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. In addition, we have contractual agreements with independent affiliates that generate royalty fees and support cross-referral arrangements similar to our EMEA segment. The Pacific region includes Australia and New Zealand. Our Asia Pacific segment accounted for 10.5% of our 2015 revenue, 10.7% of our 2014 revenue and 12.1% of our 2013 revenue. 

&#160; 

Global Investment Management 

&#160; 

Operations in our Global Investment Management reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Global Investors, LLC and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Global Investors. CBRE Global Investors provides investment management services to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real estate. It sponsors investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum in: North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. In some strategies, CBRE Global Investors and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners. 

&#160; 

CBRE Global Investors&#146; offerings are organized into four primary categories: (1) direct real estate investments through sponsored funds; (2) direct real estate investments through separate accounts; (3) indirect real estate investments through listed securities; and (4) indirect real estate investments through multi-manager investment programs. 

&#160; 

Assets under management have increased from $17.3 billion at December 31, 2005 to $89.0 billion at December 31, 2015. Our Global Investment Management segment accounted for 4.2% of our 2015 revenue, 5.2% of our 2014 revenue and 7.5% of our 2013 revenue. 

&#160; 

Development Services 

&#160; 

Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account. Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including: industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and residential/mixed-use projects. Our Development Services segment accounted for 0.6% of our 2015 revenue, 0.7% of our 2014 revenue and 0.7% of our 2013 revenue. 

&#160; 

Trammell Crow Company pursues development and investment activity on behalf of its user and investor clients (with no ownership), in partnership with its clients (through co-investment &#150; either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners) or for its own account (100% ownership). Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, Trammell Crow Company had $6.7 billion of development projects in process. Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, capital markets (structured finance) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level. Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services. We face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global, national, regional or local basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do. 

&#160; 

Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us, some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering. Among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms, such as Cushman &#38; Wakefield (which is the name adopted following the combination of DTZ and Cushman &#38; Wakefield), Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Colliers International Group Inc. (which was spun off from FirstService Corporation in 2015), Savills plc (which acquired U.S.-based service provider Studley, Inc. in 2014) and BGC Partners (which is the publicly traded 

&#160; 

parent of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank); market-segment specialists, such as Eastdil Secured, HFF, L.P. and Marcus &#38; Millichap, Inc.; and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year. Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, excluding our independent affiliates, we had more than 70,000 employees worldwide, approximately 37% of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business. At December 31, 2015, approximately 1,900 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the &#147;CBRE&#148; name. Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the &#147;CBRE&#148; and &#147;Trammell Crow Company&#148; names. We maintain trademark registrations for the CBRE service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business. 

&#160; 

We hold a license to use the &#147;Trammell Crow Company&#148; trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement. 

&#160; 

In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business. We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through CBRE Global Investors. We have not generally registered these items of intellectual property in any jurisdiction. While we may seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property. If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current &#147;operator&#148; of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and 

&#160; 

without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property. Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for &#147;greenhouse gases,&#148; which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release. Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time. 

&#160; 

While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location. However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry and us in general. Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines.
