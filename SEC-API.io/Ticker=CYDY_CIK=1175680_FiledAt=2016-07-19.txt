 Item 1. Business. Overview / Corporate History 

CytoDyn Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was originally incorporated under the laws of Colorado on May 2, 2002 under the name RexRay Corporation (its previous name). Effective August 27, 2015, the Company completed a reincorporation from Colorado to Delaware. Our principal business office is 1111 Main Street, Suite 660, Vancouver, Washington 98660. Our website can be found at www.cytodyn.com. We do not intend to incorporate any contents from our website into this annual report. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this prospectus to &#147;CytoDyn,&#148; the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; or &#147;us&#148; are to CytoDyn Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of humanized monoclonal antibodies to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (&#147;HIV&#148;) infection. Our lead product candidate, PRO 140, belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. We believe that monoclonal antibodies are a new emerging class of therapeutics for the treatment of HIV to address unmet medical needs in the area of HIV and graft versus host disease. 

The preclinical and clinical development of PRO 140 was led by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Progenics&#148;) through 2011. We acquired the asset from Progenics in October 2012, as described under &#147;PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements&#148; below. 

&#160;

PRO 140 

We believe the PRO 140 antibody shows promise as a powerful anti-viral agent while not being a chemically synthesized drug, which means fewer side effects, lower toxicity and less frequent dosing requirements, as compared to daily drug therapies currently in use for the treatment of HIV. The PRO 140 antibody belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. PRO 140 blocks HIV from entering a cell by binding to a molecule called the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (&#147;CCR5&#148;), a normal cell surface co-receptor protein to which certain strains of HIV, referred to as &#147;R5&#148; strains, attach as part of HIV&#146;s entry into a cell. 

PRO 140 is an antibody, and through several, short-term clinical trials it has demonstrated efficacy without issues relating to toxicity and autoimmune resistance. Moreover, these trials suggest that PRO 140 does not affect the normal function of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV. Instead, PRO 140 binds to a precise site on CCR5 that R5 strains of HIV use to enter the cell and, in doing so, inhibits the ability of these strains of HIV to infect the cell without affecting the cell&#146;s normal function. The R5 strains of HIV currently represent approximately 67% of all HIV infections in the U.S. As a result, we believe PRO 140 represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with advantageous virological and immunological properties and may provide a unique tool to treat HIV infected patients. 

We believe PRO 140 is uniquely positioned to address a growing HIV market as an alternative or in addition to current therapies, which are failing primarily due to drug resistance. In seven clinical trials previously conducted, PRO 140 was generally well tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, or dose-proportional adverse events, or AEs, were reported. In addition, there were no dose-limiting toxicities or patterns of drug-related toxicities observed during these trials. The results of these studies established that PRO 140&#146;s antiviral activity was potent, rapid, prolonged, dose-dependent, and statistically significant following a single dose. Because PRO 140&#146;s mechanism of action (for a monoclonal antibody use in HIV) is a relatively new therapeutic approach, it provides a very useful method of suppressing the virus in treatment-experienced patients who have failed a prior HIV regimen and need new treatment options. 

To date, PRO 140 has been tested and administered to test subjects either intravenously or as a subcutaneous injection. We believe that, if PRO 140 is approved for use as an injectable by the FDA, it may nonetheless be an attractive and marketable therapeutic option for patients with healthy CCR5, particularly in the following scenarios: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients desiring a break from existing treatment regimens, whether due to side-effects or for any personal reasons; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients with compromised organ function, such as HCV (hepatitis C) co-infection; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients with complex concomitant medical requirements; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients who choose not to start their highly active antiretroviral therapy (&#147;HAART&#148;) regimen immediately after being infected with HIV. We believe PRO 140 has demonstrated potent (as compared to existing treatments) antiretroviral activity and an encouraging safety profile in prior clinical testing, that PRO 140 has the potential to be the first long-acting (weekly or every other week), self-administered HIV therapy, and that PRO 140 inhibit CCR5-tropic HIV while preserving CCR5&#146;s natural activity. We believe PRO 140 represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with unique virological and immunological properties and may provide another distinct tool to treat HIV-infected subjects. 

Our ongoing HIV-related clinical trials, described in greater detail below, have been designed to demonstrate the proof of concept that PRO 140 monotherapy can reduce the viral load in certain HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients. Once the viral load is undetectable, weekly administration of PRO 140 can help maintain the suppressed viral load in a subpopulation of R5 patients over an extended period of time (currently shown to be approaching two years). Based on the preliminary results of such studies, we believe that a PRO 140 treatment option could address the unmet medical need for therapy options for certain HIV-infected patients with uncontrolled viral load, despite conventional HAART treatments. 

To facilitate our self-funded and sponsored clinical research plans and trials, we engaged Amarex Clinical Research, LLC (&#147;Amarex&#148;), as our principal contract research organization (&#147;CRO&#148;), to provide comprehensive clinical trial management services. 

&#160;

Current Clinical Trials 

PRO 140 is currently being studied in four ongoing clinical trials: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Our first ongoing clinical trial is an extension study of our Phase 2b treatment substitution trial, which was initially completed in January 2015. Several patients are continuing in extension studies of this monotherapy trial by taking a weekly injection of PRO 140. Results from these extension studies thus far indicate some patients are now reaching 24 months of suppressed viral load achieved through a successful monotherapy of PRO 140. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Our second ongoing clinical trial is a pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial for PRO 140 as a combination therapy to existing HAART drug regimens. The initial 25-week trial protocol included a requirement for 300 subjects. The FDA recently reduced this requirement to 150 subjects. The first subject to have successfully completed this trial has transitioned into a FDA-cleared compassionate use protocol, so as to continue on PRO 140 therapy at the request of the treating physician. &#160;

&#149; &#160; The third ongoing trial is a strategic Phase 3 trial including 300 patients to assess the treatment strategy of using PRO 140 subcutaneously as a long-acting single-agent maintenance therapy for 48 weeks in patients with suppressed viral load with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. The primary endpoint is the number of patients who can maintain suppressed viral load under a PRO 140 monotherapy replacing their HAART regimen for 48 weeks. The secondary endpoint is the number of weeks a patient is off of their ART regimen. Enrollment of first patient is anticipated to occur within the next quarter. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Our fourth ongoing trial of PRO 140 is a Phase 2 study for Graft versus Host Disease (&#147;GvHD&#148;) and is the first non-HIV indication for PRO 140. This trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center 100-day study with 60 patients is designed to evaluate the feasibility of the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GvHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention of acute GvHD in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (&#147;AML&#148;) or myelodysplastic syndrome (&#147;MDS&#148;) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (&#147;HST&#148;). Enrollment of the first patient has not been announced. The Company&#146;s recently announced fifth clinical trial is expected to commence in the near future and will evaluate PRO 140 for &#147;treatment na&#239;ve&#148; HIV patients. The protocol for this trial provides for PRO 140 to be administered to HIV patients immediately upon their diagnosis of HIV and prior to waiting two weeks before receiving the results of their genotype test, which allows their physician to prescribe a specific HAART regimen. &#147;Treatment na&#239;ve&#148; or patients who have yet to begin an antiretroviral therapy are highly contagious and the Company believes such an application for PRO 140 can be highly advantageous to the patients and the HIV population. 

Each of the foregoing trials are described more fully below. We are continuing to explore opportunities for clinical applications for PRO 140 involving the CCR5 receptor, other than HIV-related treatments, such as inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and cancer. 

Phase 2b Treatment Substitution Trial for HIV, as Monotherapy 

Our first Phase 2b clinical trial of PRO 140 commenced in May 2014 and concluded in January 2015. This Phase 2b trial, referred to as a &#147;treatment substitution&#148; trial, investigated PRO 140 as a short-term treatment substitution (as a monotherapy of PRO 140) for existing HAART drug regimens. An extension study of this trial is currently ongoing, as described in greater detail below. 

The treatment substitution trial had two primary objectives: (1) to assess the efficacy of PRO 140 monotherapy for the maintenance of viral suppression after being used in substitution of a patient&#146;s HAART regimen, and (2) to assess the clinical safety and tolerability parameters for PRO 140 following use in substitution of HAART. The study protocol required patients to be stable on HAART with patient&#146;s viral load not more than 400 HIV RNA particles per milliliter of blood for two consecutive weeks. The trial design provided that patients would be shifted from HAART regimen to PRO 140 monotherapy for 12 weeks. PRO 140 was administered as a 350mg subcutaneous dosage weekly and participants were monitored for viral rebound on a weekly basis. Total treatment duration with PRO 140 was up to 14 weeks with one week overlap of existing retroviral regimen and PRO 140 at the beginning of the study period and also one week of overlap at the end for subjects who did not experience virologic failure, defined as a viral load above 400 HIV RNA particles per milliliter of blood for two consecutive weeks. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (&#147;DSMB&#148;) was required to monitor the study to ensure patient safety and to assess efficacy. The DSMB operates in conformance with the FDA guidelines for its independence. DSMB&#146;s management and oversight of the trial was successfully completed in January 2015. 

&#160;

Below are the results from our Phase 2b treatment substitution clinical trial, excluding certain patients who violated trial protocol or were later categorized by third party tropism tests as not being infected by CCR5-tropic virus strains exclusively. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; 98% of the patients passed 4 weeks of monotherapy; &#160;

&#149; &#160; 82% of the patients passed 8 weeks of monotherapy; and &#160;

&#149; &#160; 75% of the patients passed 11 weeks of monotherapy (maximum allowable duration of monotherapy without an extension study) Because only patients who have HIV R5 virus exclusively can benefit from PRO 140, prior to enrollment in the study, each patient was required to take a DNA tropism test to determine whether the strain of HIV present in the patient was exclusively the R5 strain, making the patient a suitable candidate for PRO 140 therapy. The tropism test, however, is not accurate in patients with an undetectable viral load, which was one of the primary inclusion criteria for the Phase 2b trial. The occurrence of a number of viral rebounds due to inaccurate tropism screening, as demonstrated in the trial data, was not unexpected. 

The success of this initial monotherapy trial served as the foundation for the ongoing extension study described below. 

Phase 2b Extension Study for HIV, as Monotherapy 

The extension study of our initial Phase 2b trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 monotherapy for the maintenance of viral suppression in subjects who completed 12 weeks of monotherapy in the initial Phase 2b treatment substitution trial without experiencing virologic failure. The objectives and endpoint definitions are the same for the Phase 2b extension study, as they were for the initial Phase 2b treatment substitution trial, except that patients in the extension study were trained for weekly self-injection to be administered at home, and their viral load was monitored initially on a bi-weekly basis and then on a monthly basis later in the study. 

For the Phase 2b extension study, 19 subjects were screened for participation and 16 were allowed to enter. 14 patients successfully passed 29 weeks of PRO 140 monotherapy. Out of these 14 patients, 10 patients are currently ongoing and have completed up to 23 months of PRO 140 monotherapy without experiencing virologic failure (defined, as in the initial study, as a viral load above 400 HIV RNA particles per milliliter of blood for two consecutive weeks). Three patients discontinued the extension protocol due to either violating protocol design or missing weekly treatments. The trial is ongoing and as a result, we are only able to discuss the clinical findings to date. 

Phase 2b/3 Trial for HIV, as Combination Therapy 

In view of PRO 140 being established as a safe and efficacious substitution therapy in the initial Phase 2b monotherapy trial and ongoing extension study, following the FDA&#146;s clearance of a new trial protocol, we initiated in mid-2015 a pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial for PRO 140 as combination therapy to existing HAART drug regimens. The FDA recently reduced the number of required subjects in this trial from 300 to 150. We believe that, upon successful completion of this Phase 3 study, we will have the opportunity to seek accelerated approval for PRO 140 based on previously granted FDA fast-track candidate designation. 

The Phase 3 combination therapy trial is designed to allow PRO 140 as a component of a HAART regimen for treatment experienced patients. HAART is the current standard of medical care for individuals with HIV. The study population includes treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs within one or more drug classes, which is a second-line therapy, with additional conditions to include patients who have demonstrated evidence of HIV replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy and have limited treatment options. The treatment options may be limited as a result of drug antiretroviral class cross-resistance, documented treatment intolerance, potential for hypersensitivity to one or more antiretroviral drugs, or potential drug interactions with treatment for co-morbid conditions. Subjects will have one or more fully active, approved drugs available for construction of a viable alternative option. 

In late January 2016, we announced that we had filed a request with the FDA for designation as a &#147;breakthrough therapy&#148; treatment for certain HIV patients. In response to our filing, the FDA requested that the Company submit data from the population for which the breakthrough therapy is requested. The Company will respond to this request. 

Phase 3 Trial for HIV, as Long-term Monotherapy 

A strategic Phase 3 trial including 300 patients to assess the treatment strategy of using PRO 140 subcutaneously as a long-acting single-agent maintenance therapy for 48 weeks in patients with suppressed viral load with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. The primary endpoint is the number of patients who can maintain suppressed viral load under a PRO 140 monotherapy replacing their HAART regimen for 48 weeks. The secondary endpoint is the number of weeks a patient is off of their ART regimen. Enrollment of first patient is anticipated to occur within the next quarter and is expected to accelerate, as experienced in the previous Phase 2b monotherapy trial. 

&#160;

A Phase 3, Multicenter Study to Assess the Treatment Strategy of Using PRO 140 SC as Long-Acting Single-Agent Maintenance Therapy for 48 Weeks in Virologically Suppressed Subjects with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. This study is a multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the strategy of shifting clinically stable patients receiving suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy to PRO 140 monotherapy and maintaining viral suppression for 48 weeks following study entry. Consenting patients will be shifted from combination antiretroviral regimen to weekly PRO 140 monotherapy for 48 weeks during the Treatment Phase with the one week overlap of existing retroviral regimen and PRO 140 at the beginning of the study treatment and also one week overlap at the end of the treatment in subjects who do not experience virologic failure. 

Phase 2 Trial for Graft versus Host Disease 

In June 2015, we announced that Company-sponsored research data has expanded the potential clinical indications for PRO 140 to include certain inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity, transplantation and cancer. 

The CCR5 receptor is expressed on a variety of cells that play a central role in inflammatory responses. The receptor is activated by a chemokine mediator called CCL5, which has been shown to be a central figure in many inflammatory disease processes. Blocking the interaction of CCL5 with the receptor CCR5 is believed to be of therapeutic benefit. PRO 140 targets the CCR5 receptor, binding to it in a way that prevents HIV from using it as an entry gateway without activating the immune function of the receptor. Our recent research data indicate that PRO 140 also interferes with activation of the receptor by the mediator CCL5. 

Following new research data relating to PRO 140&#146;s mechanism of action, in October 2015, we filed with the FDA an investigational new drug (or &#147;IND&#148;) application and a full protocol for a Phase 2 clinical trial for a transplantation indication called Graft versus Host Disease (or &#147;GvHD&#148;), as our first non-HIV clinical indication. GvHD is a life-threatening complication for patients undergoing stem cell transplants. The CCR5 receptor, the target for PRO 140, is an important mediator of GvHD, especially in the organ damage that is the usual cause of death. The only approved CCR5 inhibitor, Maraviroc, is currently in a Phase 2 study for GvHD indications, and results are expected in 2016. We believe that PRO 140 has significant advantages over Maraviroc in more favorable dosing and pharmacokinetics, less toxicity and side effects, and no direct stimulation (agonist activity) of the CCR5 receptor. 

In December 2015, we received clearance from the FDA to conduct a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRO 140 for prophylaxis of acute GvHD in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (&#147;AML&#148;) or myelodysplastic syndromes (&#147;MDS&#148;) undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. The trial is a 100-day study with 60 patients. Enrollment of the first patient has not been announced. 

In late December 2015, we announced that we had filed with the FDA for designation of PRO 140 as an &#147;orphan&#148; drug, in connection with our GvHD Phase 2 trial and remains open at this time pending submission by the Company of additional clinical data. Designation as an &#147;orphan&#148; product provides potentially faster pathways to approval and other financial incentives for drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. 

Phase 2b Trial for HIV, as a Monotherapy for Treatment-Na&#239;ve Patients 

We recently announced a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRO 140 in treatment-na&#239;ve adults with HIV-1 infection. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRO 140 SC compared to placebo for the reduction of viral load in 60 treatment-na&#239;ve adults patients with HIV-1 infection for a period of two weeks. 

All eligible and consenting participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Group A: PRO140 350mg weekly S.C. Inj. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Group B: Placebo weekly S.C. Inj. Upon randomization, subjects will receive two doses of PRO 140 or placebo given seven days apart. The first dose of PRO 140 or placebo will be given on the day of randomization followed by second dose (one week after) at the initiation of HAART. Study participants will be monitored for one year following initiation of HAART. 

Other Product Candidates 

Until the clinical trials for PRO 140 have advanced further, we do not plan to devote any resources towards the development, research, testing, approval or commercialization of other product candidates. 

PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements 

We acquired PRO 140, as well as certain other related assets, including the existing inventory of PRO 140 bulk drug substance, intellectual property, and FDA regulatory filings, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 25, 2012 (the &#147;Progenics Purchase Agreement&#148;), between CytoDyn and Progenics. On October 16, 2012, the Company paid to Progenics $3,500,000 in cash to close the transaction. The Company is also required to pay Progenics the following milestone payments and royalties: (i) $1,500,000 at the time of the first dosing in a U.S. Phase 3 trial or non-US equivalent, which was paid during the year ended May 31, 2016; (ii) $5,000,000 at the time of the first US new drug application approval by the FDA or other non-U.S. approval for the sale of PRO 140; and (iii) royalty payments of up to 5% on net sales during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of PRO 140 until the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the acquired assets, and (b) 10 years, in each case determined on a country-by country basis. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company paid $1.5 million of such milestones owed to Progenics as a result of the first dosing in a U.S. Phase 3 trial. To the extent that such milestone payments and royalties are not timely made, under the terms of the Progenics Purchase Agreement, Progenics has certain repurchase rights relating to the assets sold to the Company thereunder. 

&#160;

Payments to Progenics are in addition to payments due under a Development and License Agreement, dated April 30, 1999 (the &#147;PDL License&#148;), between Protein Design Labs (now AbbVie Inc.) (&#147;PDL&#148;) and Progenics, which was assigned to the Company in the Progenics Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company has an exclusive worldwide license to develop, make, have made, import, use, sell, offer to sell or have sold products that incorporate the humanized form of the PRO 140 antibody developed by PDL under the agreement and must pay additional milestone payments and royalties as follows: (i) $1,000,000 upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial, which was paid during the year ended May 31, 2016; (ii) $500,000 upon filing a Biologic License Application with the FDA or non-U.S. equivalent regulatory body; (iii) $500,000 upon FDA approval or approval by another non-U.S. equivalent regulatory body; and (iv) royalties of up to 7.5% of net sales for the longer of 10 years and the date of expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. Additionally, the PDL License provides for an annual maintenance fee of $150,000 until royalties paid exceed that amount. During the year ended May 31, 2016 the Company paid $1 million of such milestones. To the extent that such milestone payments and royalties are not timely made, under the terms of the PDL License, AbbVie Inc. has certain termination rights relating to the Company&#146;s license of PRO 140 thereunder. Pursuant to the foregoing Progenics Purchase Agreement and PDL License, the Company accrued an expense of $2,500,000 as of May 31, 2015 in connection with the anticipated milestone payments related to the first patient dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial, all of which was paid during the year ended May 31, 2016. 

Effective July 29, 2015, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the &#147;Lonza Agreement&#148;) with Lonza Sales AG (&#147;Lonza&#148;) covering Lonza&#146;s &#147;system know-how&#148; technology with respect to CytoDyn&#146;s use of proprietary cell lines to manufacture new PRO 140 material. The Lonza Agreement required payment of &#163;600,000 (approximately US$915,000) by December 15, 2015, which was timely paid. In connection with this license agreement, the Company became the primary obligor of an additional &#163;600,000, which was accrued in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 and was timely paid by June 30, 2016. Using the foreign currency exchange rates at the time of payment, the Company&#146;s license fee payment approximated US$807,000. Future annual license fees and royalty rate will vary depending on whether we manufacture PRO 140 ourselves, utilize the third-party licensor as a contract manufacturer, or utilize an independent party as a contract manufacturer. The licensor does not charge an annual license fee of &#163;300,000 when it serves as the manufacturer. However, we currently use an independent party as a contract manufacturer. If that arrangement continues, the annual license fee of &#163;300,000 would continue to apply, as well as a royalty of 1.0% of the net selling price upon commercialization of PRO 140 (excluding value added taxes and similar amounts). 

Patents, Proprietary Technology and Data Exclusivity 

Protection of our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We may file patent applications in the U.S., Canada, China, Japan, European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of our business. 

Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date. A U.S. patent, to be selected by the Company upon receipt of FDA regulatory approval, may be subject to up to a five-year patent term extension in certain instances. While the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, most countries provide for a patent term of 20 years measured from the application filing date and some may also allow for patent term extension to compensate for regulatory approval delay. We pursue opportunities for seeking new meaningful patent protection on an ongoing basis. We currently anticipate that, absent patent term extension, patent protection relating to the PRO 140 antibody itself will start to expire in 2023, certain methods of using PRO 140 will start to expire in 2026, and certain formulations comprising PRO 140 will start to expire in 2031. 

Patents do not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs in direct competition with our products that are not covered by granted and enforceable patent claims. Consequently, patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage. See related risk factors under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; above. We may also rely on data exclusivity, trade secrets and proprietary know-how to develop and attempt to achieve a competitive position with our product candidates. We generally require our employees, consultants and partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements in an effort to protect our intellectual property. 

Separate from and in addition to the patent rights noted above, we expect that PRO 140 will be subject to at least a 12-year data exclusivity period measured from the first date of FDA licensure, during which period no other applications referencing PRO 140 will be approved by FDA. Further, no other applications referencing PRO 140 will be accepted by FDA for a 4-year period measured from the first date of FDA licensure. Accordingly, this period of data exclusivity is expected to provide at least a 12-year term of protection against competing products shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with PRO 140. Similar data exclusivity or data protection periods of up to about 5-years or more are provided in at least Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand. 

We note that data exclusivity is not an extension of patent rights, and it does not prevent the introduction of generic versions of the innovative drug during the data exclusivity period, as long as the marketing approval of the generic version does not use or rely upon the innovator&#146;s test data. Patents and data exclusivity are different concepts, protect different subject matter, arise from different efforts, and have different legal effects over different time periods.

(1) &#160; Patent term extensions and pending patent applications may extend periods of patent protection. (2) PRO 140 patents and applications relate to HIV-1 and GvHD treatments. Research, development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical product often require choosing between alternative development and optimization routes at various stages in the development process. Preferred routes depend upon current&#151;and may be affected by subsequent&#151;discoveries and test results, availability of financial resources, and other factors, and cannot be identified with certainty. There are numerous third-party patents in fields in which we work, and we may need to obtain licenses under patents of others in order to pursue a preferred development route of one or more of our product candidates. The need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate value and profitability of an affected product. If we cannot negotiate such a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether. See &#147;Risk Factors&#148; below. 

Government Regulation 

Regulation of Health Care Industry 

The health care industry is highly regulated, and state and federal health care laws and regulations are applicable to certain aspects of our business. For example, there are federal and state health care laws and regulations that apply to the operation of clinical laboratories, the business relationships between health care providers and suppliers, the privacy and security of health information and the conduct of clinical research. 

Regulation of Products 

The design, testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products is regulated by numerous third parties, including the FDA, foreign governments, independent standards auditors and our customers. 

In the United States, biological products have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling, import, export and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA through its Center for Devices and Radiological Health and its Center for Biological Evaluation and Research continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation for FDA clearance of current and new biologic products. The FDA can ban certain biological products; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded biological products; order repair, replacement or refund of these products; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to biological products that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or the Public Health Service Act pertaining to certain biological products or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. 

The lengthy process of seeking drug approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with applicable regulations can result in refusal by the FDA to approve product license applications. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted product approvals. 

Pharmaceutical products such as PRO140 may not be commercially marketed without prior approval from the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. In the United States, the process for obtaining FDA approval for products like PRO140 typically includes pre-clinical studies, the filing of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, human clinical trials and filing and approval of either a New Drug Application, or NDA, for chemical pharmaceutical products, or a BLA (biologics license application) for biological pharmaceutical products, such as PRO 140. The results of pre-clinical testing, which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations, details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can 

&#160;

begin. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. Once a sponsor submits an IND, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials, during which time the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND and raise concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials outlined in the IND. If the FDA has comments or questions, they must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA before clinical trials can begin. In addition, the FDA, an IRB or we may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Our non-clinical and clinical studies must conform to the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of submitted data and protect the rights and well-being of study patients. Information for certain clinical trials also must be publicly disclosed within certain time limits on the clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. 

The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing, chemistry, manufacturing and control information and proposed labeling are then submitted to the FDA in the form of either an NDA or BLA for review and potential approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information in a complete response letter, or deny the approval if it determines that the NDA or BLA does not provide an adequate basis for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of an NDA or BLA and may require additional testing. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and sometimes with specified post-marketing commitments. Any approval required from the FDA might not be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. 

Among the conditions for an NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the manufacturing operations conform on an ongoing basis with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. In complying with cGMPs, we must expend time, money and effort in the areas of training, production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing laboratories. A successful inspection of the manufacturing facility by the FDA is a prerequisite for final approval of a biological product like PRO140. Following approval of the NDA or BLA, we and our third-party manufacturers remain subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. We also face similar inspections coordinated by the EMEA by inspectors from particular E.U. member countries that conduct inspections on behalf of the European Union and from other foreign regulatory authorities. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could materially adversely affect our business. 

Regulatory requirements and approval processes in E.U. countries are similar in principle to those in the United States and can be at least as costly and uncertain. The European Union has established a unified centralized filing and approval system administered by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use designed to reduce the administrative burden of processing applications for pharmaceutical products derived from new technologies. In addition to obtaining regulatory approval of products, it is generally necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the facility in which the product will be manufactured. 

We use and plan to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product, including new safety risks, or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to an approved product&#146;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, the imposition of additional mandatory post-market studies or clinical trials, or the imposition of or revisions to a REMS program, including distribution and/or use restrictions. 

Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports to the FDA, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution, and, as discussed above, may be subject to mandatory post-market study and REMS requirements. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, a drug or biologic may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product&#146;s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The FDA also requires substantiation of any claims of superiority of one product over another, including the requirement that such claims be proven by adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials. The FDA also requires all promotional materials that discuss the use or effectiveness of a prescription drug or biologic to disclose in a balanced manner the risks and safety profile of the product . 

Regulation of Laboratory Operations 

Clinical laboratories that perform laboratory testing (except for research purposes only) on human subjects are subject to regulation under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&#147;CLIA&#148;). CLIA regulates clinical laboratories by requiring that the 

&#160;

laboratory be certified by the federal government, licensed by the state and comply with various operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical laboratory test results are accurate, reliable and timely. State law and regulations also apply to the operation of clinical laboratories. 

State Governments 

Most states in which we operate have regulations that parallel federal regulations. Most states conduct periodic unannounced inspections and require licensing under such state&#146;s procedures. Our research and development activities and the manufacture and marketing of our products are and will be subject to rigorous regulations relating to product safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. 

Other Laws and Regulations 

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, clinical, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation applying to our business that might result from any legislative or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. 

Environmental 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with these regulations did not have during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. 

Registrational Clinical Trials Process 

Described below is the traditional registrational drug development track. Our current business strategy is to focus primarily on our PRO 140 Phase 3 trials, seeking additional indications in trials that we will sponsor and fund (subject to the availability of sufficient capital to pursue additional paths to approval), to manage our Phase 2 trial for GvHD and to continue to evaluate and leverage the clinical data from our recently completed Phase 2b treatment substitution trial. 

Phase 1 

Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biologic into humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients, but are usually conducted in a small number of healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the investigational product&#146;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects are obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. Phase 1 studies of PRO 140 have been conducted and completed by or on behalf of Progenics by Dr. Jacobson and others prior to our acquisition of PRO 140. 

Phase 2 

Phase 2 includes the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, often involving several hundred people. In some cases, depending upon the need for a new drug, a particular drug candidate may be licensed for sale in interstate commerce after a &#147;pivotal&#148; Phase 2 trial. 

Phase 2 is often broken into Phase 2a, which can be used to refer to &#147;pilot trials,&#148; or more limited trials evaluating exposure response in patients, and Phase 2b trials that are designed to evaluate dosing efficacy and ranges. 

Phase 3 

Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled clinical studies. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in Phase 2, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually involve significantly larger groups of patients, and considerable additional expense. We are required to pay significant fees to third parties upon the first patient dosing in a Phase 3 trial of PRO 140. See the discussion under the subheading &#147;PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements&#148; above. 

&#160;

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our development efforts may compete with more established biotechnology companies that have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do. 

Advancing PRO 140 to commercialization is our highest priority. PRO 140 blocks a cell receptor called CCR5, which is the entry point for most strains of HIV virus. Pfizer&#146;s Maraviroc (Selzentry &#174; ) is the only currently approved CCR5 blocking agent. Maraviroc like all other HIV approved drugs must be taken daily and are believed to have significant side effects. For these reasons, we believe that our lead product, PRO 140, a monoclonal antibody, may prove to be useful in patients that cannot tolerate existing HIV therapies or desire a respite from those therapies. Nonetheless, manufacturers of current therapies, such as Pfizer, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ViiV Healthcare, are very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources. We expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share. 

To construct a HAART regimen, three drugs from two classes of drugs are typically needed. Currently there are only five different classes of drugs. Each class of drugs has many drugs available in that class except the entry inhibitor (EI) class. The only drug in EI class approved by the FDA is Maraviroc, a drug taken orally twice a day. Upon approval, we believe that PRO 140 will be the only approved drug outside of the main four classes of drugs approved for HIV since 2007. 

The only other monoclonal antibody in clinical development for HIV that we are aware of is TMB-335 referred to as ibalizumab being developed by TiaMed Biologics. Ibalizumab targets the CD4 receptor on T-cells which is one of the two co-receptors required for HIV entry into T-cells. However, CD4 is the T-cell receptor for recognizing targets of the immune response and critical for immunologic responses. We believe that targeting CD4 will interfere with immune function to an undesirable extent and if developed further will vastly limit the potential of ibalizumab as an effective anti-HIV therapy. 

Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Our competitors may succeed in developing potential drugs or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our potential drug candidates. Worldwide, there are many antiviral drugs for treating HIV. In seeking to manufacture, distribute and market the potential drugs we hope to have approved, we face competition from established pharmaceutical companies.. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, management expertise, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources and experience than we do. 

We also expect that the number of our competitors and potential competitors will increase as more potential drugs receive commercial marketing approvals from the FDA or analogous foreign regulatory agencies. Any of these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing, marketing and distributing HIV treatments. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of PRO 140. We expect to depend on third-party suppliers and manufacturing organizations for all of our clinical trial quantities of PRO 140, in addition to previously manufactured supplies of PRO 140. We continue to explore alternative manufacturing sources, in order to ensure that we have access to sufficient manufacturing capacity in order to meet potential demand for PRO 140 in a cost-efficient manner. 

We have developed and validated a current good manufacturing practice (&#147;cGMP&#148;) process to manufacture PRO 140, through a single contract manufacturer, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. This contract manufacturer previously produced multi-Kg scale bulk batches of PRO 140 under cGMP for our Phase 2 clinical studies and is capable of producing sufficient quantities of PRO 140 for all the clinical studies required prior to submitting a BLA to the FDA. In addition, we have undertaken certain comparability studies which supported the use of previously manufactured amounts of PRO 140 in current and planned clinical studies. This process has been completed and all PRO 140 drug substance can be used in our clinical trials. 

Research and Development Costs 

Our research and development expenses totaled approximately $13.7 million and $15.2 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively. We expect the Company&#146;s research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as the activity within the Company&#146;s clinical trials expands and the Company&#146;s biologics manufacturing processes and related regulatory compliance activities increase. 

&#160;

Employees and Consultants 

We have five full-time employees, our CEO, CFO, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, Associate Director Process Sciences and Director of Accounting, as well as several independent consultants assisting us with our clinical trials of PRO 140 and manufacturing activities. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to identify or hire and retain additional employees or consultants on acceptable terms in the future.
