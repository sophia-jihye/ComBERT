General 

We are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the United States. In addition, we provide a number of building services and industrial services. In 2015, we had revenues of approximately $6.7 billion. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility and institutional customers through approximately 70 &#32; operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Our executive offices are located at 301 Merritt Seven, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851-1092, and our telephone number at those offices is (203) 849-7800. 

We specialize principally in providing construction services relating to electrical and mechanical systems in all types of non-residential and certain residential facilities and in providing various services relating to the operation, maintenance and management of facilities, including refineries and petrochemical plants. 

Due to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented as discontinued operations.

We provide construction services and building services directly to corporations, municipalities and federal and state governmental entities, owners/developers, and tenants of buildings. We also provide our construction services indirectly by acting as a subcontractor to general contractors, systems suppliers, property managers and other subcontractors. Our industrial services generally are provided directly to refineries and petrochemical plants. Worldwide, as of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 29,000 employees. 

Our revenues are derived from many different customers in numerous industries, which have operations in several different geographical areas. Of our 2015 revenues, approximately 94% were generated in the United States and approximately 6% were generated in foreign countries, substantially all in the United Kingdom. In 2015, approximately 33% of revenues were derived from new construction projects, 18% were derived from renovation and retrofit of customer&#8217;s existing facilities, 35% were derived from our building services operations, and 14% were derived from our industrial services operations. 

The broad scope of our operations is more particularly described below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income and total assets of each of our segments with respect to each of the last three years, and our revenues and assets attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom for the last three years, see Note 17 - Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Operations 

The electrical and mechanical construction services industry has grown over the years due principally to the increased content, complexity and sophistication of electrical and mechanical systems, as well as the installation of more technologically advanced voice and data communications, lighting, and environmental control systems in all types of facilities in large part due to the integration of digital processing and information technology. For these reasons, buildings need extensive electrical distribution systems. In addition, advanced voice and data communication systems require sophisticated power supplies and extensive low-voltage and fiber-optic communications cabling. Moreover, the need for substantial environmental controls within a building, due to the heightened need for climate control to maintain extensive computer systems at optimal temperatures, and the demand for energy savings and environmental controls in individual spaces have over the years expanded opportunities for our electrical and 

mechanical services businesses. The demand for these services is typically driven by non-residential construction and renovation activity. 

Electrical and mechanical construction services primarily involve the design, integration, installation and start-up, and provision of services relating to: (a) electric power transmission and distribution systems, including power cables, conduits, distribution panels, transformers, generators, uninterruptible power supply systems and related switch gear and controls; (b) premises electrical and lighting systems, including fixtures and controls; (c) low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control systems; (d) voice and data communications systems, including fiber-optic and low-voltage cabling; (e) roadway and transit lighting and fiber-optic lines; (f) heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation systems; (g) fire protection systems; (h) plumbing, process and high-purity piping systems; (i) controls and filtration systems; (j) water and wastewater treatment systems; (k) central plant heating and cooling systems; (l) cranes and rigging; (m) millwrighting; and (n) steel fabrication, erection and welding. 

Electrical and mechanical construction services generally fall into one of two categories: (a) large installation projects with contracts often in the multi-million dollar range that involve construction of manufacturing and commercial buildings and institutional and public works projects or the fit-out of large blocks of space within commercial buildings and (b) smaller installation projects typically involving fit-out, renovation and retrofit work. 

Our United States electrical and mechanical construction services operations accounted for about 51% of our 2015 revenues, approximately 65% of which were related to new construction and approximately 35% of which were related to renovation and retrofit projects. Due to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we focus in the United Kingdom principally on building services. 

We provide electrical and mechanical construction services for both large and small installation and renovation projects. Our largest projects have included those: (a) for institutional purposes (such as educational and correctional facilities and research laboratories); (b) for manufacturing purposes (such as pharmaceutical plants, steel, pulp and paper mills, chemical, food, automotive and semiconductor manufacturing facilities and power generation); (c) for transportation purposes (such as highways, bridges, airports and transit systems); (d) for commercial purposes (such as office buildings, data centers, convention centers, sports stadiums and shopping malls); (e) for hospitality purposes (such as resorts, hotels and casinos); (f) for water and wastewater purposes; and (g) for healthcare purposes. Our largest projects, which typically range in size from $10.0 million up to and occasionally exceeding $150.0 million and are frequently multi-year projects, represented approximately 27% of our worldwide construction services revenues in 2015. 

Our projects of less than $10.0 million accounted for approximately 73% of our worldwide construction services revenues in 2015. These projects are typically completed in less than one year. They usually involve electrical and mechanical construction services when an end-user or owner undertakes construction or modification of a facility to accommodate a specific use. These projects frequently require electrical and mechanical systems to meet special needs such as critical systems power supply, fire protection systems, special environmental controls and high-purity air systems, sophisticated electrical and mechanical systems for data centers, new production lines in manufacturing plants, and office arrangements in existing office buildings. They are not usually dependent upon the new construction market. Demand for these projects and types of services is often prompted by the expiration of leases, changes in technology, or changes in the customer&#8217;s plant or office layout in the normal course of a customer&#8217;s business. 

We have a broad customer base with many long-standing relationships. We perform construction services pursuant to contracts with owners, such as corporations, municipalities and other governmental entities, general contractors, systems suppliers, construction managers, developers, other subcontractors and tenants of commercial properties. Institutional and public works projects are frequently long-term complex projects that require significant technical and management skills and the financial strength to obtain bid and performance bonds, which are often a condition to bidding for and winning these projects. 

We also install and maintain lighting for streets, highways, bridges and tunnels, traffic signals, computerized traffic control systems, and signal and communication systems for mass transit systems in several metropolitan areas. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture and install sheet metal air handling systems for both our own mechanical construction operations and for unrelated mechanical contractors. We also maintain welding and pipe fabrication shops in support of some of our mechanical operations. 

Our United States building services segment offers a broad range of services, including operation, maintenance and service of electrical and mechanical systems; commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and 

services, including outage services to utilities and manufacturing facilities; military base operations support services; mobile mechanical maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management and maintenance with respect to energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects. 

These building services, which generated approximately 35% of our 2015 revenues, are provided to owners, operators, tenants and managers of all types of facilities both on a contract basis for a specified period of time and on an individual task order basis. Of our 2015 building services revenues, approximately 87% were generated in the United States and approximately 13% were generated in the United Kingdom. 

Our building services operations have built upon our traditional electrical and mechanical services operations and our client relationships to expand the scope of services being offered and to develop packages of services for customers on a regional and national basis. 

Demand for our building services is often driven by customers&#8217; decisions to focus on their core competencies, customers&#8217; programs to reduce costs, the increasing technical complexity of their facilities and their mechanical, electrical, voice and data and other systems, and the need for increased reliability, especially in electrical and mechanical systems. These trends have led to outsourcing and privatization programs whereby customers in both the private and public sectors seek to contract out those activities that support, but are not directly associated with, the customer&#8217;s core business. Clients of our building services business include federal and state governments, utilities, independent power producers, pulp and paper producers, and major corporations engaged in information technology, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, financial services, publishing and other manufacturing, and large retailers and other businesses with geographically dispersed portfolios throughout the United States. 

We currently provide building services in a majority of the states in the United States to commercial, industrial, institutional and governmental customers and as part of our operations are responsible for: (a) the oversight of all or most of the facilities operations of a business, including operation and maintenance; (b) servicing, upgrade and retrofit of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and industrial piping and sheet metal systems in existing facilities; (c) interior and exterior services, including floor care and janitorial services, landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; (d) diagnostic and solution engineering for building systems and their components; and (e) maintenance and support services to manufacturers and power producers. 

In the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, we provide building services at a number of preeminent buildings, including those that house the Secret Service, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other government facilities including the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. We also provide building services to a number of military bases, including base operations support services to the Navy National Capital Region and the Army&#8217;s Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and are also involved in a joint venture providing building services to the Naval Support Activity Mid-South Base in Tennessee. The agreements pursuant to which this division provides services to the federal government are frequently for a base year and a number of option years exercisable at the sole discretion of the government, are often subject to renegotiation by the government in terms of scope of services, and are subject to termination by the government prior to the expiration of the applicable term. 

Our United Kingdom subsidiary primarily focuses on building services and currently provides a broad range of services under multi-year agreements to public and private sector customers, including airlines, airports, real estate property managers, manufacturers and governmental agencies. 

Our industrial services business is a recognized leader in the refinery turnaround market and has a growing presence in the petrochemical market. In July 2013, we acquired RepconStrickland, Inc. expanding services we provide to our refinery and petrochemical customers and significantly increasing the size of our industrial services business. Our industrial services business: (a) provides after-market maintenance, repair and cleaning services for highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers for refineries and petrochemical plants both in the field and at our own shops, including tube and shell repairs, bundle repairs, and extraction services, and (b) designs and manufactures new highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers. We also perform a broad range of turnaround and maintenance services for critical units of refineries so as to upgrade, repair and maintain them. Such services include turnaround and maintenance services relating to: (i) engineering and planning services in advance of complex refinery turnarounds, (ii) overhaul and maintenance of critical process units (including hydrofluoric alkylation units, fluid catalytic cracking units, coking units, heaters, heat exchangers and related mechanical equipment) during refinery and petrochemical plant shut downs, (iii) replacement and new construction capital projects for refineries and petrochemical plants, and (iv) other related specialty technical services such as (a) welding, including pipe welding, and fabrication; heater, boiler, and reformer repairs and replacements; converter repair and revamps; and vessel, exchanger and tower services; (b) tower and column repairs in refineries and petrochemical facilities; (c) installation and repair of refractory materials for critical units in process plants so as to protect 

equipment from corrosion, erosion, and extreme temperatures; and (d) acid-proofing services to protect critical components at refineries from chemical exposure. 

Competition 

In our construction services, building services and industrial services businesses, we compete with national, regional and local companies, many of which are small, owner-operated entities that carry on their businesses in a limited geographic area, as well as with certain foreign companies. 

We believe that the electrical and mechanical construction services businesses are highly fragmented and our competition includes thousands of small companies across the United States. In the United States, there are a few public companies focused on providing either electrical and/or mechanical construction services, such as Integrated Electrical Services, Inc., Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and Tutor Perini Corporation. A majority of our revenues are derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, technical capability and financial strength. Because we have total assets, annual revenues, access to bank credit and surety bonding and expertise significantly greater than most of our competitors, we believe we have a significant competitive advantage over our competitors in providing electrical and mechanical construction services. Competitive factors in the electrical and mechanical construction services business include: (a) the availability of qualified and/or licensed personnel; (b) reputation for integrity and quality; (c) safety record; (d) cost structure; (e) relationships with customers; (f) geographic diversity; (g) the ability to control project costs; (h) experience in specialized markets; (i) the ability to obtain surety bonding; (j) adequate working capital; (k) access to bank credit; and (l) price. However, there are relatively few significant barriers to entry to several types of our construction services business. 

While the building services business is also highly fragmented with most competitors operating in a specific geographic region, a number of large United States based corporations such as AECOM Technology Corporation, Johnson Controls, Inc., Fluor Corp., J&#38;J Worldwide Services, Cushman &#38; Wakefield Inc., CB Richard Ellis, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Sodexo, Inc., Aramark Corporation and ABM Industries Incorporated are engaged in this field, as are large original equipment manufacturers such as Carrier Corp. and Trane Inc. In addition, we compete with several regional firms serving all or portions of the markets we target, such as Brickman Valley Crest, Inc., Kellermeyer Bergensons Services, Inc., SMS Assist, LLC and Ferandino &#38; Sons, Inc. Our principal services competitors in the United Kingdom include ISS UK Ltd. and MITIE Group plc. The key competitive factors in the building services business include price, service, quality, technical expertise, geographic scope and the availability of qualified personnel and managers. Due to our size, both financial and geographic, and our technical capability and management experience, we believe we are in a strong competitive position in the building services business. However, there are relatively few barriers to entry to most of our building services businesses. 

In our industrial services business, we are a leading North American provider of after-market maintenance and repair services for, and manufacturing of, highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers and related equipment and a leader in providing specialized services to refineries and petrochemical plants. The market for providing these services and products to refineries and petrochemical plants is highly fragmented and includes large national industrial services providers, as well as numerous regional companies, including JV Industrial Companies Ltd., Matrix Service Company, Starcon, Turner Industries, Team, Inc., Cust-O-Fab, Dunn Heat, and Wyatt Field Service Company. In the manufacture of heat exchangers, we compete with both U.S. and foreign manufacturers. The key competitive factors in the industrial services market include service, quality, ability to respond quickly, technical expertise, price, safety record and availability of qualified personnel. Due to our technical capabilities, safety record and skilled workforce, we believe that we are in a strong competitive position in the industrial services market we serve. Because of the complex tasks associated with turnarounds and the precision required in the manufacture of heat exchangers, we believe that the barriers to entry in this business are significant. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 29,000 people, approximately 56% of whom are represented by various unions pursuant to more than 375 collective bargaining agreements between our individual subsidiaries and local unions. We believe that our employee relations are generally good. Only two of these collective bargaining agreements are national or regional in scope. 

Backlog 

Our backlog at December 31, 2015 was $3.77 billion compared to $3.63 billion of backlog at December 31, 2014. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. We include a project within our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of services contracts. However, we do not include in backlog contracts for which 

we are paid on a time and material basis and a fixed amount cannot be determined, and if the remaining term of a services contract exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of revenues provided for in the contract award. Our backlog also includes amounts related to services contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total revenues can be made from budgeted amounts agreed to with our customer. Our backlog is comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business and (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider recovery to be probable. Such claim amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. Our backlog does not include anticipated revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures or variable interest entities and anticipated revenues from pass-through costs on contracts for which we are acting in the capacity of an agent and which are reported on the net basis. We believe our backlog is firm, although many contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers. Historically, cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us. We estimate that 79% of our backlog as of December 31, 2015 will be recognized as revenues during 2016.
