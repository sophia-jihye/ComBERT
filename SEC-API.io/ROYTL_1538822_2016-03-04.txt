 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is a statutory trust formed in January 2012 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a Trust Agreement (as amended, the &#147;Trust Agreement&#148;) among Pacific Coast Energy Company LP (&#147;PCEC&#148;), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Delaware Trustee (the &#147;Delaware Trustee&#148;).

&#160; 

The Trust was created to acquire and hold net profits and royalty interests in certain oil and natural gas properties located in California for the benefit of the Trust unitholders. On May 8, 2012, the Trust and PCEC entered into a Conveyance of Net Profits Interests and Overriding Royalty Interest (the &#147;Conveyance&#148;), pursuant to which PCEC conveyed to the Trust the net profits interests (&#147;Net Profits Interests&#148;) and a royalty interest (&#147;Royalty Interest&#148;), which are collectively referred to herein as the &#147;Conveyed Interests,&#148; in certain oil and natural gas properties located onshore in California (the &#147;Underlying Properties&#148;). The Conveyed Interests represent undivided interests in the Underlying Properties. The Conveyed Interests were conveyed by PCEC to the Trust concurrently with the initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) of the Trust&#146;s units of beneficial interest (&#147;Trust Units&#148;) in May 2012. 

&#160; 

The Conveyed Interests are passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Underlying Properties consist of (i) the proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2011 on the Underlying Properties, which are referred to as the &#147;Developed Properties,&#148; and (ii) all other development potential on the Underlying Properties, which are referred to as the &#147;Remaining Properties.&#148; Production from the Developed Properties attributable to the Trust is produced from wells that, because they have already been drilled, generally require limited additional capital expenditures. Production from the Remaining Properties that is attributable to the Trust requires capital expenditures for the drilling of wells and installation of infrastructure. PCEC supplies the required capital on behalf of the Trust during the drilling and development period; however, because the costs initially incurred exceed gross proceeds, the Remaining Properties currently have negative net profits. During this period of negative net profits, instead of being paid net profits, the Trust is paid a 7.5% overriding royalty on the portion of the Remaining Properties located on PCEC&#146;s Orcutt properties (the &#147;Royalty Interest Proceeds&#148;). Once revenues from the Remaining Properties have paid back PCEC for the cumulative costs it has advanced on behalf of the Trust, then the NPI on the Remaining Properties will be paid out (&#147;NPI Payout&#148;) in place of the Royalty Interest Proceeds. Collectively, these interests entitle the Trust to receive the following: 

&#160; 

Developed Properties 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Developed Properties.

&#160; 

Remaining Properties 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 7.5% of the proceeds (free of any production or development costs but bearing the proportionate share of production and property taxes and post-production costs) attributable to the sale of all oil and natural gas production from the Remaining Properties located on PCEC&#146;s Orcutt properties, or

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 25% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from all of the Remaining Properties.

&#160; 

The Trust has no employees. The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee. The Trust&#146;s purpose is to hold the Conveyed Interests, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Conveyed Interests and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Conveyed Interests and the Trust Units. The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities. The Trustee has no authority over or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and natural gas operations or other activities on the Underlying Properties. The Delaware Trustee has only minimal rights and duties as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flow from the Conveyed Interests. The Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay Trust administrative or incidental expenses that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee or an affiliate as a lender provided the terms of the loan are fair to the Trust unitholders and similar to the terms it would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship, although neither the Trustee nor any of its affiliates has any intention of lending or obligation to lend funds to the Trust. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself, if the 

&#160; 

&#160; 

interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. 

&#160; 

In connection with the formation of the Trust, the Trust entered into several agreements with PCEC that impose obligations upon PCEC that are enforceable by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, including the Conveyance, an operating and services agreement and a registration rights agreement. The operating and services agreement provides that PCEC must perform specified operating and informational services on behalf of the Trust in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with the sound and prudent practices of providers of similar services. The Trustee has the power and authority under the Trust Agreement to enforce these agreements on behalf of the Trust. The Trustee may from time to time supplement or amend the Conveyance, the operating and services agreement and the registration rights agreement without the approval of Trust unitholders in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provisions, to grant any benefit to all of the Trust unitholders, to comply with changes in applicable law or to change the name of the Trust. Such supplement or amendment, however, may not materially adversely affect the interests of the Trust unitholders. Additionally, the Trustee may, from time to time, supplement or amend these agreements without the approval of the Trust unitholders as long as such supplement or amendment would not materially increase the costs or expenses of the Trust or adversely affect the economic interest of the Trust unitholders; however, the Trustee may not modify or amend the Conveyance if the modification or amendment would change the character of the Conveyed Interests in such a way that the Conveyed Interests become working interests or that the Trust would fail to continue to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trustee is entitled to rely upon a written opinion of counsel or certification of PCEC as conclusive evidence that any such amendment or supplement is authorized. 

&#160; 

Other than Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust&#146;s only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the Conveyed Interests and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) in that month, over the Trust&#146;s expenses paid for that month. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee determines to hold as a reserve against future expenses. 

&#160; 

The Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for future liabilities of the Trust. If the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are, or will be, insufficient to cover the Trust&#146;s liabilities, the Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust. The Trustee may also cause the Trust to mortgage its assets to secure payment of the indebtedness. If the Trustee causes the Trust to borrow funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. As of December 31, 2015 the Trust had cash reserves of $44,999 for future Trust expenses. The Trust calculates net profits and royalties from the Underlying Properties separately for each of the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties. Any excess costs for either the Developed Properties or the Remaining Properties will not reduce net profits calculated for the other. 

&#160; 

Each month, the Trustee pays Trust obligations and expenses and distributes to the Trust unitholders the remaining proceeds received from the Conveyed Interests. The cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities or for distribution at the next distribution date may be invested in a limited number of permitted investments. Alternatively, cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a noninterest bearing account. 

&#160; 

PCEC provided the Trust with a $1.0 million letter of credit to be used by the Trust if its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due. Further, PCEC may loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses, and PCEC has agreed to do so under certain circumstances. Any funds provided under the letter of credit or loaned by PCEC may only be used for the payment of current accounts or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or for the payment of other accrued current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust&#146;s business, and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness. If the Trust draws on the letter of credit or PCEC loans funds to the Trust, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined monthly cash distribution amount) until such amounts drawn or borrowed, including interest thereon, are repaid in full. Any loan made by PCEC will be on an unsecured basis, and the terms of such loan will be substantially the same as those which would be obtained in an arm&#146;s-length transaction between PCEC and an unaffiliated third party. On February 25, 2016, the Trust borrowed from PCEC $232,000 and is expecting to borrow $137,000 from PCEC on March 10, 2016. 

&#160; 

The Trust is not subject to any pre-set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the passage of time. The Trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following: (1) the Trust, upon approval of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units, sells the Conveyed Interests, (2) the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Conveyed Interests, in the aggregate, is less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive years, (3) the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units vote in favor of dissolution or (4) the Trust is judicially dissolved. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee would sell all of the Trust&#146;s assets, either by private sale or public auction, and after payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment of all liabilities of the Trust, distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Post-Production Services 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Conveyance, PCEC has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil and natural gas production attributable to the Conveyed Interests. The terms of the Conveyance restrict PCEC from charging any fee for marketing production attributable to the Net Profits Interests other than fees for marketing paid to non-affiliates. Accordingly, a marketing fee will not be deducted (other than fees paid to non-affiliates) in the calculation of the Net Profits Interests; however, the terms of the Conveyance provide that costs and expenses PCEC allocates to marketing production from the Underlying Properties are deducted from the calculation of gross profits. The Royalty Interest Proceeds are free of any production or development costs but are subject to a proportionate share of production and property taxes and post-production costs. The net profits and royalties to the Trust from the sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties attributable to the Conveyed Interests are determined based on the same price that PCEC receives for sales of oil and natural gas production attributable to PCEC&#146;s interest in the Underlying Properties. However, if the oil or natural gas is processed, the net profits and royalties receive the same processing upgrade or downgrade as PCEC. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, PCEC sold the oil produced from the Underlying Properties to third-party oil purchasers. Oil production from the Underlying Properties is typically transported by pipeline from the field to a gathering facility or refinery. PCEC sells the majority of the oil production from the Underlying Properties under contracts using market sensitive pricing. The price received by PCEC for the crude oil production from the Underlying Properties is based upon published industry standard market sensitive regional price postings, adjusted based upon delivery location and actual quality of the crude produced. In 2015, Phillips 66 accounted for 92% of PCEC&#146;s net sales. All natural gas produced by PCEC at Orcutt Hill is consumed in the lifting and production of the Diatomite and Conventional Orcutt crude; all other natural gas produced is marketed and sold to third-party purchasers, based upon published Industry market sensitive regional price postings for the natural gas. 

&#160; 

Competition and Markets 

&#160; 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. PCEC competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than PCEC, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow. The Trust is subject to the same competitive conditions as PCEC and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry. 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy, may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Price fluctuations for oil and natural gas will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Trust&#146;s interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, neither the Trust nor PCEC can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of future product prices on the Trust. 

&#160; 

Description of Trust Units 

&#160; 

Each Trust Unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the Trust assets and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. The Trust Units are in book-entry form only and are not represented by certificates. The Trust had 38,583,158 Trust Units outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Distributions and Income Computations 

&#160; 

Each month, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the Conveyed Interests and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) that month, over the Trust&#146;s liabilities for that month. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee determines to hold as a reserve against future liabilities. The holders of Trust Units as of the applicable record date (generally within five business days after the last business day of each calendar month) are entitled to monthly distributions payable on or before the 10th business day after the record date. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the IRS, the Trustee will treat the income and expenses of the Trust for each month as belonging to the Trust unitholders of record on the monthly record date. Trust unitholders generally will recognize income and expenses for tax purposes in the month the Trust receives or pays those amounts, rather than in the month the Trust distributes the cash to which such income or expenses (as applicable) relate, which may cause minor variances. For example, the Trustee could establish a reserve in one month that would not result in a tax deduction until a later month. See &#147;&#151;Federal Income Tax Matters.&#148; 

&#160; 

Transfer of Trust Units 

&#160; 

Trust unitholders may transfer their Trust Units in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will not require either the transferor or transferee to pay a service charge for any transfer of a Trust Unit. The Trustee may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The Trustee may treat the owner of any Trust Unit as shown by its records as the owner of the Trust Unit. The Trustee will not be considered to know about any claim or demand on a Trust Unit by any party except the record owner. A person who acquires a Trust Unit after any monthly record date will not be entitled to the distribution relating to that monthly record date. Delaware law will govern all matters affecting the title, ownership or transfer of Trust Units. 

&#160; 

Periodic Reports 

&#160; 

The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and mails to Trust unitholders annual reports directing them to correctly report their share of the income and deductions of the Trust. The Trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports that are required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of The New York Stock Exchange, and also causes the Trust to comply with applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including but not limited to, establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the operating and services agreement, PCEC has agreed to provide to the Trust such services as are necessary for the Trust and the Trustee to comply with the Trust Agreement and Article IV of the Conveyance, and such other operating and administrative services of similar character and scope to the foregoing that the Trustee may reasonably request PCEC that provide, including accounting, bookkeeping and informational services and other services as may be necessary for the preparation of reports the Trust is or may be required to prepare and/or file in accordance with applicable tax and securities laws, exchange listing rules and other requirements, including reserve reports and tax returns (collectively, the &#147;Administrative Services&#148;). 

&#160; 

Liability of Trust Unitholders 

&#160; 

Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. No assurance can be given, however, that the courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware will give effect to such limitation. 

&#160; 

Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders 

&#160; 

The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust Units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust will be responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders unless such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders, in which case the Trust unitholders that called such meeting will be responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting of Trust unitholders. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the Trustee in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of Trust Units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust unit owned. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be deemed to be a vote cast. 

&#160; 

Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust Units present in person or by proxy at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true, even if a majority of the total Trust Units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units is required to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; dissolve the Trust;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; amend the Trust Agreement (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of Trust unitholders in any material respect); or

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; approve the sale of all or any material part of the assets of the Trust (including the sale of the Conveyed Interests).

&#160; 

In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement may be made by the Trustee without approval of the Trust unitholders. 

&#160; 

Computation of Net Profits Interests and Overriding Royalty Interest 

&#160; 

The provisions of the Conveyance governing the computation of the net profits and royalties are detailed and extensive. The following information summarizes the material provisions of the Conveyance related to the computation of the net profits and royalties, but is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Conveyance, which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Net Profits Interests 

&#160; 

The amounts paid to the Trust for each Net Profits Interest are based on, among other things, the definitions of &#147;gross profits&#148; and &#147;net profits&#148; contained in the Conveyance and described below. Under the Conveyance, net profits are computed monthly. Each calendar month, 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Developed Properties is paid to the Trust generally on or before the eighth business day after the last business day of the following month. For any monthly period during which costs for the Remaining Properties exceed gross proceeds, the Trust is entitled to receive the Royalty Interest Proceeds and the Trust continues to receive such proceeds until the first day of the month following an NPI Payout. In calendar months following an NPI Payout, 25% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from all of the Remaining Properties will be paid to the Trust on or before the end of the following month. Due to significant planned capital expenditures to be made by PCEC on the Remaining Properties for the benefit of the Trust and also as a result of lower commodity prices, PCEC expects the Trust to only receive payments associated with the Remaining Properties in the form of Royalty Interest Proceeds until the NPI Payout occurs, which PCEC estimates will be in approximately 2028. 

&#160; 

&#147;Gross profits&#148; means the aggregate amount received by PCEC that is attributable to sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties from and after April 1, 2012 (after deducting the appropriate share of all royalties and any overriding royalties, production payments and other similar charges and other than certain excluded proceeds (including, with respect to the Remaining Properties, the Royalty Interest, to the extent paid), as described in the Conveyance), including all proceeds and consideration received (i) for advance payments, (ii) under take-or-pay and similar provisions of production sales contracts (when credited against the price for delivery of production) and (iii) under balancing arrangements. Gross profits do not include consideration for the transfer or sale of any Underlying Property by PCEC or any subsequent owner to any new owner, unless the Net Profits Interest in such Underlying Property is released (as is permitted under certain circumstances). Gross profits also do not include any amount for oil or natural gas lost in production or marketing or used by the owner of the Underlying Properties in drilling, production and plant operations.

&#160; 

&#147;Net profits&#148; means gross profits less the following costs, expenses and, where applicable, losses, liabilities and damages all as actually incurred by PCEC from and after April 1, 2012 and attributable to production from the Underlying Properties from and after April 1, 2012 (as such items are reduced by any offset amounts, as described in the Conveyance):

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all costs for (i) drilling, development, production and abandonment operations, (ii) all direct labor and other services necessary for drilling, operating, producing and maintaining the Underlying Properties and workovers of any wells located on the Underlying Properties, (iii) treatment, dehydration, compression, separation and transportation, (iv) all materials purchased for use on, or in connection with, any of the Underlying Properties and (v) any other operations with respect to the exploration, development or operation of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages with respect to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties for (i) defending, prosecuting, handling, investigating or settling litigation, administrative proceedings, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and other liabilities, (ii) the payment of certain judgments, penalties and other liabilities, (iii) the payment or restitution of any proceeds of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties, (iv) complying with applicable local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, (v) tax or royalty audits and (vi) any other loss, cost, expense, liability or damage with respect to the Underlying Properties not paid or reimbursed under insurance;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all taxes, charges and assessments (excluding federal and state income, transfer, mortgage, inheritance, estate, franchise and like taxes) with respect to the ownership of, or production of hydrocarbons from, the Underlying Properties;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all insurance premiums attributable to the ownership or operation of the Underlying Properties for insurance actually carried with respect to the Underlying Properties, or any equipment located on any of the Underlying Properties, or incident to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all amounts and other consideration for (i) rent and the use of or damage to the surface, (ii) delay rentals, shut-in well payments and similar payments and (iii) fees for renewal, extension, modification, amendment, replacement or supplementation of the leases included in the Underlying Properties;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all amounts charged by the relevant operator as overhead, administrative or indirect charges specified in the applicable operating agreements or other arrangements covering the Underlying Properties or PCEC&#146;s operations with respect thereto;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; to the extent that PCEC is the operator of certain of the Underlying Properties and there is no operating agreement covering such portion of the Underlying Properties, those overhead, administrative or indirect charges that are allocated by PCEC to such portion of the Underlying Properties;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; if, as a result of the occurrence of the bankruptcy or insolvency or similar occurrence of any purchaser of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties, any amounts previously credited to the determination of the net profits are reclaimed from PCEC, then the amounts reclaimed;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; all costs and expenses for recording the Conveyance and, at the applicable times, terminations and/or releases thereof;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; amounts previously included in gross profits but subsequently paid as a refund, interest or penalty; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; at the option of PCEC (or any subsequent owner of the Underlying Properties), amounts reserved for approved development expenditure projects, including well drilling, recompletion and workover costs, which amounts will at no time exceed $2.0 million in the aggregate, and will be subject to the limitations described below (provided that such costs shall not be debited from gross profits when actually incurred).

&#160; 

Costs deducted in the net profits determination will be reduced by certain offset amounts. The offset amounts are further described in the Conveyance, and include, among other things, certain net proceeds attributable to the treatment or processing of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties and certain other non-production revenues, including salvage value for equipment related to plugged and abandoned wells. If the offset amounts exceed the costs during a monthly period, the ability to use such excess amounts to offset costs will be deferred and utilized as offsets in the next monthly period to the extent such amounts, plus accrued interest thereon, together with other offsets to costs, for the applicable month, are less than the costs arising in such month. 

&#160; 

The Trust is not liable to the owners of the Underlying Properties, PCEC, or any other operator for any operating, capital or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Underlying Properties. If the net profits relating to the Developed Properties for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust will receive no payment for the Developed Properties for that period, and any such negative amount will be deducted from gross profits for the Developed Properties in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net profits relating to the Developed Properties for that following computation period. If the net profits relating to the Remaining Properties for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust is entitled to receive the Royalty Interest Proceeds. 

&#160; 

Gross profits and net profits are calculated on a cash basis, except that certain costs, primarily ad valorem taxes and expenditures of a material amount, may be determined on an accrual basis. 

&#160; 

Overriding Royalty Interest 

&#160; 

For any monthly period during which costs for the Remaining Properties exceed gross proceeds, the Trust is entitled to receive an amount equal to 7.5% of the proceeds attributable to the sale of all production from the Remaining Properties located on PCEC&#146;s Orcutt properties, including but not limited to PCEC&#146;s interest in such production (free of any production or development costs but bearing its proportionate share of production and property taxes and post-production costs) (the &#147;Royalty Interest&#148;). Due to significant capital expenditures to be made by PCEC on the Remaining Properties for the benefit of the Trust and also as a result of lower commodity prices, PCEC expects the Trust to only receive payments associated with the Remaining Properties in the form of Royalty Interest Proceeds until the NPI Payout occurs, which PCEC estimates will be in approximately 2028. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Proceeds from the sale of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production from the Remaining Properties located on PCEC&#146;s Orcutt properties in any calendar month means the amount calculated based on actual sales volumes from such properties, in each case after deducting the Trust&#146;s proportionate share of: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; any taxes levied on the severance or production of the oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from such properties and any property taxes attributable to the oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from the such properties; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; post-production costs, which generally consists of costs incurred to gather, store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas produced, as applicable (excluding costs for marketing services provided by PCEC).

&#160; 

Proceeds payable to the Trust from the sale of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production attributable to the Remaining Properties located on PCEC&#146;s Orcutt properties in any calendar month are not subject to any deductions for any expenses attributable to exploration, drilling, development, operating, maintenance or any other costs incident to the production of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas attributable to such properties, including any costs to drill, complete or plug and abandon a well. Additionally, costs associated with any completion activities will be borne by PCEC or any third-party operator of the well. 

&#160; 

Additional Provisions 

&#160; 

If a controversy arises as to the sales price of any production, then for purposes of determining gross profit or the amount of Royalty Interest Proceeds: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; any proceeds that are withheld for any reason (other than at the request of PCEC) are not considered received until such time that the proceeds are actually collected;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; amounts received and promptly deposited with a nonaffiliated escrow agent will not be considered to have been received until disbursed to it by the escrow agent; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; amounts received and not deposited with an escrow agent will be considered to have been received.

&#160; 

The Trustee is not obligated to return any cash received from the Conveyed Interests. Any overpayments made to the Trust by PCEC due to adjustments to prior calculations of net profits, royalties or otherwise will reduce future amounts payable to the Trust until PCEC recovers the overpayments plus interest at a prime rate (as described in the Conveyance). 

&#160; 

The Conveyance generally permits PCEC to transfer without the consent or approval of the Trust unitholders all or any part of its interest in the Underlying Properties, subject to the Conveyed Interests. The Trust unitholders are not entitled to any proceeds of a sale or transfer of PCEC&#146;s interest. Except in certain cases where the Conveyed Interests are released, following a sale or transfer, the Underlying Properties will continue to be subject to the Conveyed Interests, and the gross profits and if applicable, the royalties, attributable to the transferred property will be calculated for such transferred property on a stand-alone basis (as part of the computation of net profits and royalties described in this Annual Report), paid and distributed by the transferee to the Trust. PCEC will have no further obligations, requirements or responsibilities with respect to any such transferred interests, provided that PCEC delivers to the Trustee an agreement of the transferee of such transferred interests, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, in which such transferee assumes the responsibility to perform the Administrative Services that PCEC is required to provide to the Trust pursuant to the operating and services agreement relating to the interests being transferred. 

&#160; 

In addition, PCEC may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trust to release the Conveyed Interests associated with any lease that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the Underlying Properties in the prior twelve months, provided that the Conveyed Interests covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any twelve-month period, an aggregate fair market value to the Trust of $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by PCEC to a non-affiliate of the relevant Underlying Properties, are conditioned upon an amount equal to the fair market value (net of sales costs) to the Trust of such Conveyed Interests and will be treated as an offset amount against costs and expenses. PCEC has not identified for sale any of the Underlying Properties. 

&#160; 

As the designated operator of a property included in the Underlying Properties, PCEC may enter into farm-out, operating, participation and other similar agreements to develop the property, but any transfers made in connection with such agreements will be made subject to the Conveyed Interests. PCEC may enter into any of these agreements without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any Trust unitholder. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

PCEC will have the right to release, surrender or abandon its interest in any Underlying Property if PCEC determines in good faith and in accordance with the reasonably prudent operator standard that such Underlying Property that will no longer produce (or be capable of producing) hydrocarbons in paying quantities (determined without regard to the Conveyed Interests). Where PCEC does not operate the Underlying Properties, PCEC is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise its contractual rights to cause the operators of such Underlying Properties to act as a reasonably prudent operator. Upon such release, surrender or abandonment, the portion of the Conveyed Interests relating to the affected property will also be released, surrendered or abandoned, as applicable. PCEC will also have the right to abandon an interest in the Underlying Properties if (a) such abandonment is necessary for health, safety or environmental reasons or (b) the hydrocarbons that would have been produced from the abandoned portion of the Underlying Properties would reasonably be expected to be produced from wells located on the remaining portion of the Underlying Properties. 

&#160; 

PCEC must maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable for the Conveyed Interests to the Trust. Monthly and annually, PCEC must deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of the net profits for each computation period. The Trustee has the right to inspect and review the books and records maintained by PCEC during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. Each Trust unitholder and his representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the Trust and the Trustee relating to the Trust, subject to such restrictions as are set forth in the Trust agreement. 

&#160; 

Federal Income Tax Matters 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of certain U.S. income tax matters that may be relevant to the Trust unitholders. This summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), existing and proposed Treasury regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. No attempt has been made in the following summary to comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting the Trust or the Trust unitholders. 

&#160; 

The summary has limited application to non-U.S. persons and persons subject to special tax treatment such as, without limitation: banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; Trust unitholders subject to the alternative minimum tax; tax-exempt organizations; dealers in securities or commodities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; non-U.S. Trust unitholders that are &#147;controlled foreign corporations&#148; or &#147;passive foreign investment companies&#148;; persons that are S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that own their interest in the Trust Units through S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that at any time own more than 5% of the aggregate fair market value of the Trust Units; expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; U.S. Trust unitholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; persons who hold the Trust Units as a position in a hedging transaction, &#147;straddle,&#148; &#147;conversion transaction&#148; or other risk reduction transaction; or persons deemed to sell the Trust Units under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. Each Trust unitholder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to his particular circumstances. 

&#160; 

Classification and Taxation of the Trust 

&#160; 

Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in its opinion, the Trust would be treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS or another taxing authority. The remainder of the discussion below is based on tax counsel&#146;s opinion, at the time of formation, that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a grantor trust, the Trust is not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the Trust level. Rather, each Trust unitholder is considered for federal income tax purposes to own its proportionate share of the Trust&#146;s assets directly as though no Trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the Trust unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust, rather than when distributed by the Trust. Each Trust unitholder is subject to tax on its proportionate share of the income and gain attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its proportionate share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust, subject to applicable limitations, in accordance with the Trust unitholder&#146;s tax method of accounting and taxable year without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the Trust. 

&#160; 

The Trust will file annual information returns, reporting to the Trust unitholders all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The Trust will allocate these items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to Trust unitholders based on record ownership on the monthly record dates. It is possible that the IRS or another taxing authority could disagree with this allocation method and could assert that income and deductions of the Trust should be determined and allocated on a daily or prorated basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the unitholders affected by this issue and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the Trust in subsequent periods. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Classification of the Net Profits Interests and the Royalty Interest 

&#160; 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Net Profits Interests attributable to the Developed Properties (the &#147;Developed NPI&#148;), Remaining Properties (the &#147;Remaining NPI&#148;) and the Royalty Interest will have the tax characteristics of a mineral royalty interest to the extent, at the time of its creation, such Developed NPI, Remaining NPI or Royalty Interest is reasonably expected to have an economic life that corresponds substantially to the economic life of the mineral property or properties burdened thereby. Payments out of production that are received in respect of a mineral interest that constitutes a royalty interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes are taxable under current law as ordinary income subject to an allowance for cost or percentage depletion in respect of such income. 

&#160; 

Based on the reserve report and representations made by PCEC regarding the expected economic life of the Underlying Properties and the expected duration of the Conveyed Interests, tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that the Developed NPI will and the Remaining NPI and the Royalty Interest should be treated as continuing, nonoperating economic interests in the nature of royalties payable out of production from the mineral interests they burden. 

&#160; 

Consistent with the foregoing, PCEC and the Trust intend to treat the Conveyed Interests as mineral royalty interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Conveyed Interests are treated as mineral royalty interests. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert that any such interest should be treated differently. Any such different treatment could affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in Trust Units. 

&#160; 

Reporting Requirements for Widely-Held Fixed Investment Trusts 

&#160; 

The Trustee assumes that some Trust Units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in the Treasury regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a custodian street name, collectively referred to herein as &#147;middlemen&#148;). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (&#147;WHFIT&#148;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 919 Congress Avenue, Austin, Texas 78701, telephone number 1-512-236-6555, is the representative of the Trust that will provide the tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding Trust Units on behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury regulations with respect to such Trust Units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose Trust Units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the Trust Units. Any generic tax information provided by the Trustee of the Trust is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns. 

&#160; 

Available Trust Tax Information and U.S. Federal Income Tax Rates 

&#160; 

In compliance with the Treasury regulations reporting requirements for non-mortgage widely-held fixed investment trusts and the dissemination of Trust tax reporting information, the Trustee provides a generic tax information reporting booklet which is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their 2015 federal and state income tax returns. This tax information booklet can be obtained at www.pacificcoastoiltrust.com. 

&#160; 

Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals is 39.6%, and the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains (generally, gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) and qualified dividends of individuals is 20%. The highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 35%, and such rate applies to both ordinary income and capital gains. 

&#160; 

Section 1411 of the Code imposes a 3.8% Medicare tax on certain investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. For these purposes, investment income generally will include a unitholder&#146;s allocable share of the trust&#146;s interest and royalty income plus the gain recognized from a sale of Trust Units. In the case of an individual, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) the individual&#146;s net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the individual&#146;s modified adjusted gross income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on such individual&#146;s federal income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income, or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

California State Tax Matters 

&#160; 

PCEC has obtained a waiver from the State of California of the requirement to withhold 7% of the amounts paid to the Trust that are attributable to the Conveyed Interests held by unitholders not qualifying for an exemption from withholding. PCEC agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such waiver, including by seeking a renewal of such waiver prior to its expiration under California law. PCEC has received a renewal of the waiver for the years 2016 and 2017. PCEC may not be able to obtain such a waiver in the future, in which case PCEC would be required to withhold such amounts. Unless extended, the waiver will expire on December 31, 2017, and the Trust will be required to begin withholding beginning with the distribution expected to be paid in January 2018. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters and Regulation 

&#160; 

General. &#160; PCEC&#146;s oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent, comprehensive and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the release, discharge or emission of materials into the environment, the handling of hazardous substances or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on PCEC&#146;s operations, including requirements to:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; obtain permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; limit or prohibit drilling and production activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, streams, coastal regions or areas that may contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; properly manage and dispose of waste and wastewater, and restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as spills, restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; minimize impacts to neighbors; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; plug and abandon wells and restore properties upon which wells are drilled.

&#160; 

Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of PCEC&#146;s operations. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry may increase the cost of doing business in the industry and may consequently affect profitability. PCEC believes that it is in material compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to its current operations. However, the clear trend in environmental law and regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could have a material adverse effect on PCEC&#146;s development expenses, results of operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of PCEC&#146;s operations, and there can be no assurance that PCEC will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products in the environment. PCEC&#146;s inability to obtain future discretionary permits could limit the future performance of the Conveyed Interests. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which PCEC&#146;s business operations are subject. 

&#160; 

Hazardous substances and waste handling. &#160; The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;) and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#147;hazardous substance&#148; into the environment. Under CERCLA, these &#147;responsible persons&#148; may include the current or past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible

&#160; 

&#160; 

persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. 

&#160; 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#147;RCRA&#148;) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA has deleted authority to the individual states to administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, production and development of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA&#146;s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. PCEC may, from time to time generate hazardous waste that is subject to RCRA. Such wastes must be properly tested, characterized and disposed of according to state and federal regulations. 

&#160; 

The real properties upon which PCEC conducts its operations have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although PCEC may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released at or from the real properties upon which PCEC conducts its operations, or at or from other, offsite locations, where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, the real properties upon which PCEC conducts its operations may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under PCEC&#146;s control. These real properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released at or from these properties may give rise to liability for PCEC pursuant to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, PCEC could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of abandoned wells to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action. 

&#160; 

At the Orcutt Diatomite properties, the cyclic steam stimulation technique has the potential to stimulate the release of hydrocarbons from the separate, overlying outcrop formation. This outcrop formation at points is very shallow and reaches the surface at a number of locations. Historically, this has led to naturally occurring seeps onto the surface. A number of these seeps have occurred in the vicinity of our Diatomite operations. PCEC regularly inspects this surface area for seeps, and notifies appropriate authorities when required. PCEC uses collection drains to contain and collect these hydrocarbons under agency supervision so that they do not escape into the environment. The small amount of hydrocarbons collected from the seeps are gathered along with PCEC&#146;s other production from its Orcutt properties. 

&#160; 

Water discharges. &#160; The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the &#147;Clean Water Act,&#148; and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA&#146;s and the Corps&#146; jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act&#146;s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of the Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. The Clean Water Act also imposes spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements, including requirements for appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters of the United States in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws required individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.

&#160; 

The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (&#147;OPA&#148;), which establishes a variety of requirements pertaining to oil spill prevention, containment and cleanup. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, are required to develop and implement plans for preventing and responding to oil spills and, if a spill occurs, may be subject to oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from the spill. Effective as of September 2015, comparable California regulations require spill contingency plans for inland oil and gas facilities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, naturally occurring radioactive material (&#147;NORM&#148;) is at times brought to the surface in connection with oil and natural gas production. Concerns have arisen over traditional NORM disposal practices (including discharge through publicly owned treatment works into surface waters), which may increase the costs associated with management of NORM. 

&#160; 

Underground injection control (&#147;UIC&#148;) . The Safe Drinking Water Act (&#147;SDWA&#148;) and comparable state laws regulate the construction, operation, permitting and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground for storage or disposal. Under the SDWA&#146;s UIC Program, producers must obtain federal or state Class II injection well permits and routinely monitor and report fluid volumes, pressures and chemistry, and conduct mechanical integrity tests on injection wells. While in some states the EPA itself implements the UIC Program for Class II wells, which are used to inject brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production, other states such as California have primary enforcement authority with respect to the regulation of Class II wells. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewater, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. As a result of these concerns, regulators in some states are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety.

&#160; 

In addition, in July 2014, the EPA sent a letter to the California Environmental Protection Agency and California Natural Resources Agency describing &#147;serious deficiencies&#148; in the state&#146;s UIC Program and setting forth comprehensive requirements and deadlines for bringing the program into compliance with federal regulations by February 2017. In its letter, the EPA mandated an in-depth review of all existing Class II wells in California that may be injecting into non-exempt aquifers as well as a review of the state&#146;s aquifer exemption process. In addition, the EPA directed the state to prohibit new and existing injections into aquifers that have not been approved as exempt by the EPA by February 15, 2017. The state responded by promising to comply with the EPA&#146;s directives through a combination of rulemaking and administrative orders. This increased scrutiny of Class II wells has resulted in the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (&#147;DOGGR&#148;) ordering the closure of 15 injection wells in California in October 2015; additional closures are expected. Although none of PCEC&#146;s injection wells have been ordered shut by DOGGR, if new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position. 

&#160; 

Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#147;NAAQS&#148;), for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. In addition the EPA has adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emission from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as &#147;green completions.&#148; These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The Clean Air Act also imposes leak detection requirements for new or modified natural gas processing plants. These laws and regulations may require PCEC to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.

&#160; 

Compliance with these rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. States can impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA, and California air quality laws and regulations are in many instances more stringent than comparable federal laws and regulations. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements relating to air emissions are particularly stringent in Southern California and Santa Barbara County. 

&#160; 

Climate change . In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other &#147;greenhouse gases&#148; present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering

&#160; 

&#160; 

and boosting facilities. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent by 2025. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs for PCEC. 

&#160; 

In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the implementation of state and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. 

&#160; 

California has been one of the leading states in adopting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, and has implemented a cap and trade program as well as mandates for renewable fuels sources. California&#146;s cap and trade program requires PCEC to report greenhouse gas emissions and essentially sets maximum limits or caps on total emissions of greenhouse gases from all industrial sectors that are or become subject to the program. This includes the oil and natural gas extraction sector of which PCEC is a part. PCEC&#146;s main sources of greenhouse gas emissions for its oil and gas operations are primarily attributable to emissions from internal combustion engines powering generators to produce electricity, flares for the disposal of excess field gas and emissions from drilling rigs. Under the California program, the cap declines annually from 2013 through 2020. PCEC will be required to obtain authorizations for each metric ton of greenhouses emitted, either in the form of allowances (each the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide) or qualifying offset credits. A portion of the allowance will be granted by California, but any shortfall between the state-granted allowance and the facility&#146;s emissions will have to be addressed through the purchase of additional allowances either from the state or a third party. The availability of allowances will decline over time in accordance with the declining cap, and the cost to acquire such allowances may increase over time. These regulations increase PCEC&#146;s costs for those operations and adversely affect its operating results and the amount of net profits it pays to the Trust. PCEC is in compliance with California&#146;s program. 

&#160; 

The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require PCEC to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative fuels and thereby decrease demand for the oil and gas PCEC produces. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth&#146;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Such climatic events could have an adverse effect on PCEC&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

National Environmental Policy Act and California Environmental Quality Act. &#160; Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (&#147;NEPA&#148;). Some of PCEC&#146;s production, most notably from the Sawtelle property, is located on federally-administered land and therefore permits or authorizations issued for this field may be subject to NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.

&#160; 

The California Environmental Quality Act (&#147;CEQA&#148;) imposes similar requirements on California state and local agencies to review environmental impacts from their proposed approvals and to develop and impose mitigation measures appropriate to reduce such impacts to insignificance where feasible. All of the Underlying Properties are located in California and are therefore subject to CEQA to the extent discretionary permits or approvals are required from California state or local agencies. In particular, PCEC&#146;s plan to increase production in the Orcutt Diatomite beyond the currently-permitted wells will require additional permits and approvals from various state, federal and local agencies, in addition to a new review under CEQA, including an environmental impact report. Such a process could take many months or longer, and there can be no assurance that such permits would be granted or timely obtained or on terms and conditions consistent with PCEC&#146;s proposed plan. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Endangered Species Act. &#160; The federal Endangered Species Act (&#147;ESA&#148;) and similar state statutes restrict activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The presence of endangered species or designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause PCEC to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in the affected areas, including the obligation to obtain permits from the United States Fish &#38; Wildlife Service (&#147;FWS&#148;) or the California Department of Fish &#38; Wildlife with respect to one or more such species. For example, as a result of a settlement reached in 2011, the FWS is required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened over the next several years. The habitats of certain protected species are known to include portions of PCEC&#146;s areas of operation, and others may yet be found or proposed for protection at one or more of the Underlying Properties.

&#160; 

OSHA and other laws and regulations. &#160; The operations of PCEC are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#147;OSHA&#148;) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

&#160; 

Accidental spills or releases may occur in the course of operations, and we cannot assure you that PCEC will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons. In addition, we expect to be required to incur remediation costs for property, wells and facilities at the end of their useful lives. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or ability to make distributions to the Trust.
