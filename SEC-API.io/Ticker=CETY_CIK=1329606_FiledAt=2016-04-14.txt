Our Company 

&#160;

Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) (the &#8220; Company, &#8221; &#8220; Clean Energy, &#8221; or &#8220; CETY &#8221; ) headquartered in Costa Mesa, California , designs, builds and markets clean energy products focused on energy efficiency and environmentally sustainable technologies. The Company &#8217; s principal product is the Clean Cycle TM generator, offered by its wholly owned subsidiary Heat Recovery Solutions. The Heat Recovery Solutions system captures waste heat from a variety of sources and turns it into electricity that users can use or sell back to the grid. CETY &#8217; s proven cutting-edge technology allows any commercial or industrial heat generators to boost their overall energy efficiency with no fuel, no pollutants and virtually no maintenance. Company &#8217; s engineering and manufacturing resources support its heat recovery solutions business, as well as continuing to support other Clean Energy emerging growth companies with their technologies. CETY is positioned to become a worldwide leader in an ever expanding energy efficiency market. 

Heat Recovery Solutions was established in 2008 and was acquired by General Electric International, Inc. in October of 2010. Heat Recovery Solutions has a proven technology and is a leader in a billion-dollar heat to power market. CETY acquired all assets of GE HRS and global patents and licenses for reciprocating engines, biomass and turbine applications and merged its legacy engineering and manufacturing facility with HRS. 

The core technology is a magnetic lev bearing generator, which requires no oil or lubricant and has no gear box. We have over 100 units installed globally with more than 1 million fleet operating hours in diesel, gas and biomass applications.

Our growth strategy is to scale up our business by focusing on new market segments &#38; regions in the fuel, incentive and process markets, sell equipment direct and through our global distributors, build and lease systems sites in island nations to offset the cost of their diesel fuel &#38; emissions, license patented technology and proprietary process, develop cogeneration and OEM opportunities and develop higher output generators while lowering the cost. 

&#160;

&#160;

With our focus on Cleantech we &#8217; re going to continue to utilize our relationships and core expertise in engineering and manufacturing to identify, acquire and develop leading clean energy and clean technology solutions and products. 

On March 15, 2013, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition with Trident Manufacturing, Inc., a Utah corporation, ( &#8220; Trident &#8221; ), and the shareholders of Trident, to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident. Trident is a electronics engineering &#38; manufacturing service company with a 16,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility based in Salt Lake City, Utah and has been servicing the industrial, aerospace, military, instrumentation, and medical markets since 2005.

On March 20, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Trident whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident and all its operational assets in exchange for 1,600,000 shares of our restricted shares of common stock. As a result of the acquisition, Trident has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Probe Manufacturing, Inc. As a result, we recognized $420,673 in goodwill. On January 2. 2016 we closed the Trident facility in Utah and as for the year ended December 31, 2015 we booked an impairment of the Goodwill in the amount of $420,673.

On September 11, 2015 (the &#8220; Effective Date &#8221; ), Clean Energy HRS LLC ( &#8220; CE HRS &#8221; ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Probe Manufacturing, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220; Company &#8221; ), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220; Asset Purchase Agreement &#8221; ) with General Electric International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( &#8220; GEII &#8221; ), pursuant to which the Company acquired GEII &#8217; s Heat Recovery Solutions ( &#8220; HRS &#8221; ) assets, including intellectual property, patents, trademarks, machinery, equipment, tooling and fixtures. The HRS assets will be used by the Company to manufacture and commercialize Organic Rankine Cycle ( &#8220; ORC &#8221; )-based heat recovery power systems. The ORC system comprises GEII &#8217; s proprietary Clean Cycle turbine generator system and integrated power module, together with related components, controls, power electronics, software and equipment. The Company co-locate and integrated the HRS assets with the Company &#8217; s existing business at the current HRS facility in Costa Mesa, California. As consideration for the purchase of the HRS assets, the Company entered into a promissory note with GEII with terms defined in Asset Purchase Agreement (exhibit 10.1) and assume certain liabilities of GEII related to the acquired assets. The cash portion of the purchase price will be paid pursuant to a three-

year promissory note. In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into various ancillary agreements customary for asset acquisition transactions of this type.

On October 9, 2015, Mr. Meddy Sahebi, Mr. Daniel Elliott, Ms. Erin Falconer, Mr. Juha Rouvinen and Mr. William Maloney were appointed as Directors of the Company, to serve until the next annual meeting of the Shareholders and/or until his successor is duly appointed. 

On October 12, 2015, Mr. Juhani Taskinen, resigned as a Director of the Company. On December 23, 2015, Mr. Shervin Talieh, resigned as an Officer and Director of the Company. Neither Mr. Taskinen, nor Mr. Talieh &#8217; s resignations were the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company &#8217; s operations, policies or practices. 

Clean Cycle Heat Recovery Solutions; Organic Rankine Cycle Generator Subsidiary 

Our CE HRS subsidiary provides clean energy and environmentally sustainable technology solutions to companies through the offering of heat recovery solutions products. The Company &#8217; s principal product offering currently is the &#8220; Clean Cycle TM &#8221; generator. The Clean Cycle generator converts heat from a variety of sources into clean, affordable electricity.

Our Clean Cycle TM ORC engine generates electricity from any heat source, typically through a heat exchanger and a closed loop hot water or steam loop directed to the Clean Cycle. The process by which the Clean Cycle generates electricity - called the Organic Rankine Cycle - requires no fuel, produces no emissions, and is closed loop. Our Clean Cycle Containerized Solution has been meticulously engineered to produce reliable power from a variety of different heat sources. The Major components are delivered as a complete turnkey package and include, the Integrated Power Module ( &#8220; IPM &#8221; ), Clean Cycle Generator, the Container and the Condenser. Where we will deliver the pieces completely assembled and ready to connect to each other and the heat source. All the power and flow adjustments are automatically controlled and remotely monitored. Due to the low amount of moving parts the IPM is a low maintenance solution, that requires no oils, no lubricants, no external rotating seals, and does not require manned operation. The whole package (except condenser) is mounted in a 20ft ISO shipping container. The Condenser comes as a separate piece and attaches to the top of the ISO container. Once the Condenser is attached to the ISO Container all that is left to do is attach the container to the heat source, and it is ready to produce energy.

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder &#8217; s deficit of $1,249,843 and a working capital deficit of $2,012,417 and a net loss of $2,569,936 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $4,875,138 as of December 31, 2015 and used $617,553 in net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach a profitable operating stand and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.

Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:

&#160;

&#183;

changes in the macro-economic environment and related changes in electricity &#38; fuel cost;

&#183;

the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products and solutions;

&#183;

our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our customers;

Clean Cycle Turbine Generator - Organic Rankine Cycle

The Organic Rankine Cycle ( &#8220; ORC &#8221; ) is a thermodynamic process where heat is transferred to a fluid at a constant pressure. The fluid inside the generator is vaporized and then expanded in a vapor turbine that drives a turbine generator, producing electricity. The spent vapor is condensed to liquid and recycled back through the cycle.

Its applications include power generation from solar, geothermal and waste heat sources. As per an article published in Distributed Energy, ORCs are most useful for waste heat recovery among these three applications. Waste heat recovery can be 

applied to a variety of low&#173; to medium temperature heat streams. An example of a successful installation is in Marshall Island for Marshall Electric Company to offset engine fuel use and produce additional electricity. The two cycle generators will generate an estimated 184kW of net electrical power from the heat of exiting engines. The clean cycle units, which require no added fuel and produce no additional emissions, are expected to displace 3.5 million liters of fuel and 10,000 metric tons of CO 2 . This will be a particularly useful in Island nations where the cost of energy is higher and it can offset the cost of their fuel and reduce emissions.

Plan of Operation 

Management is taking the following steps to sustain profitability and growth: (i) increase sales through existing global distribution channels and utilization of direct sales (ii) sell electricity by kWH to Island nations where the cost of energy is higher and it can offset the cost of their fuel and reduce emissions.(iii) leveraging core competencies to acquire technologies and entertain equity opportunities and (iv) license patented technology and proprietary process and develop cogeneration and OEM opportunities.

Our future success is likely dependent on our ability to sustain profitable growth and attain additional capital to support growth. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing, or that it will be able to generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations. The successful outcome of these or any future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute its business plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

&#160;

Business Model 

Our business objective is to design and develop Clean Cycle turbine generators that we can manufacture for direct sale to customers, or license our technology to manufacturers and other producers of specialized applications. Our revenue has and will come from:

&#183;

Sales thru global distribution channels;

&#183;

Direct sales revenue from Clean Cycle turbine generators we manufacture in-house or through contractors;

&#183;

Up-front license fees and on-going royalties based on sales by our licensees;

&#183;

Sales thru cogeneration or OEM opportunities.

With respect to certain waste heat recovery applications, we also expect to realize revenue through the development, design and installation of power generation systems (inclusive of our Clean Cycle turbine generators as an electricity generator), which could be sold to customers or provided to customers through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Waste heat recovery is the process of using heat generated from another source, such as an industrial furnace, to power our Clean Cycle turbine generators which, in turn, drives an electric motor. We have established a specialized subsidiary company &#8211; HRC LLC , of which we own 100% of its equity &#8211; to pursue these opportunities.

Clean Cycle Turbine Generators Global Market Overview 

&#160; 

The world currently faces fundamental problems with its energy supply, which are due primarily to the reliance on fossil fuels. The economic prosperity of the wealthiest nations in the twentieth century was built on a ready supply of inexpensive fossil fuel and developing nations have continued in the twenty-first century to consume fossil fuel reserves at an ever increasing rate. This has led to worldwide reserve depletions, indicating that both oil and gas are likely to be effectively exhausted before the end of this century. Only coal reserves are expected to last into the next century. Yet even if fossil fuel supplies were unconstrained, their continued use poses its own problems. All fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, which appears to result in the warming of the earth's atmosphere with profound environmental implications across the globe.

&#160;

These problems have resulted in the realization that the world must both increase the efficiency of its utilization of fossil fuels and decrease its reliance upon them. Environmental issues related to fossil fuel combustion arose first during the 1980s with the advent of acid rain, a product of the sulfur and nitrogen emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Power plants were forced by legislation and economic measures to control these emissions. However it is the recognition of global warming that presents the most serious challenge because carbon dioxide exists at much higher levels in the flue gases of power plants and major types of industrial manufacturing facilities than sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

&#160;

Although renewable energy capacity offers a hedge against major price rises because most renewable technologies exploit a source of energy that is freely available, many renewable technologies today still rely on government subsidies to make them competitive. Governments may also impose penalties upon companies, such as carbon trading schemes, which discourage the use of fossil fuels or increase its costs by imposing stringent emissions limits.

&#160;

Given the international concerns regarding global warming and pollution and the need to more efficiently utilize fossil fuels, we believe that there exists substantial worldwide demand and a growing market for our Clean Cycle turbine generators that can enable companies to generate greater amounts of energy from the same supply of fossil fuels and that also reduce the amount of harmful emissions that would otherwise be released from the combustion of those fossil fuels. Our technologies, including our Clean Cycle turbine generators, could benefit companies by both reducing energy costs and mitigating possible emissions penalties.

Growth Strategy 

Our growth strategy is to continue leveraging our currency, relationships and core competencies in waste heat recovery systems for increased sales and equity opportunities. 

The Company will focus its waste heat recovery technology to industries that create wasted heat as a result of their manufacturing or production processes. This market is well defined and, according to a recent report published by the U.S. Department of Energy, &#8220; The United States industrial sector accounts for approximately one third of all energy used in the United States, consuming approximately 32 quadrillion (a million billion) BTUs of energy annually and emitting about 1,680 million metric tons of carbon dioxide associated with this energy use. &#8221; The opportunity in the waste heat recovery market is substantial. The report continues, &#8220; A valuable alternative approach to improving overall energy efficiency is to capture and reuse the lost or &#8216; waste heat &#8217; that is intrinsic to all manufacturing processes. During these manufacturing processes, as much as 20% to 50% of the energy consumed is ultimately lost via waste heat contained in streams of hot exhaust gases and liquids, as well as through heat conduction, convection, and radiation from hot equipment surfaces and from heated product streams. In some cases, such as industrial furnaces, waste heat recovery can improve energy efficiency by 10% to as much as 50%. &#8221; 

The advantage of recapturing and utilizing waste heat is that it typically replaces purchased electric power, much of which does and will continue to require burning fossil fuels, or directly replaces fuels which must be purchased and combusted. Thus it actually can directly reduce emissions and eliminate transmission losses. Projections of market potential are truly enormous, with unrecovered waste heat in industrial processes estimated at half a quintillion (a billion billion) BTUs. The Company believes that if it can capture even a small percentage of this market it would have a strong opportunity to reduce exhaust emissions, assist in lowering energy costs of the manufacturers, while growing the Company and its client base.

&#160;

Competition 

The competitors with our Cycle Generators are ORC manufacturers such as Turboden , Ormat and some start-ups with less than 5 installations and some engine competitors aligning with ORC such as Wartsila, Caterpillar and Cummins. We believe that Clean Energy HRS is an industry leader within the small scale ORC applications. 

Employees 

&#160;

We presently have approximately 19 employees, including production, program management, materials management, engineering, sales, quality, and administrative and management personnel. We have never experienced work stoppages, and are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations, and the operations of businesses that we may acquire, are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements. However, material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements. Material cost may rise due to additional manufacturing cost of raw or made parts with the application of new regulations. Our liabilities may also increase due to additional regulations imposed by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. In addition, our past, current and future operations and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns.

&#160; 

Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems in the future. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our 

future operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our Heat Recovery Solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance at a lower cost when our Clean Cycle turbine generators are commercialized. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our future customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards
