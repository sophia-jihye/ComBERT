&#8226; monetary and fiscal policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; 

&#8226; results of examinations of Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or to write-down assets, change Sound Community Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital position or affect our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings; 

&#8226; increases in premiums for deposit insurance; 

&#8226; our ability to control operating costs and expenses; 

&#8226; the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; 

&#8226; difficulties in reducing risks associated with the loans on our balance sheet; 

&#8226; staffing fluctuations in response to product demand or the implementation of corporate strategies that affect our workforce and potential associated charges; 

&#8226; our ability to keep pace with technological changes, including our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, &#147;denial of service&#148; attacks, &#147;hacking&#148; and identity theft;

&#8226; adverse changes in the securities markets; 

&#8226; the inability of key third-party providers to perform their obligations to us; 

&#8226; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the financial institution regulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, including additional guidance and interpretation on accounting issues and details of the implementation of new accounting methods; and 

&#8226; other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services and the other risks described from time to time in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) . 

We wish to advise readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and that the factors listed above could materially affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from any such forward-looking statements expressed with respect to future periods and could negatively affect our stock price performance.

We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Sound Financial Bancorp, a Maryland corporation, is a bank holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sound Community Bank.

As a Washington commercial bank, the Bank&#146;s regulators are the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (&#147;WDFI&#148;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Sound Financial Bancorp.

Our principal business consists of attracting retail and commercial deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one- to four-family residences (including home equity loans and lines of credit), commercial and multifamily, construction and land, consumer and commercial business loans. We offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loan products, including manufactured home loans, floating homes, automobile loans, boat loans and recreational vehicle loans. As part of our business, we focus on residential mortgage loan originations, the majority of which we sell to Fannie Mae. We sell loans which conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae (&#147;conforming&#148;) with servicing retained to maintain the direct customer relationship and to continue providing strong customer service to our borrowers. We also originate loans which do not conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae (&#147;non-conforming&#148;) loans to be held in our loan portfolio and for sale with servicing released. We originate and retain a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, including those secured by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, multifamily property, manufactured home parks and construction and land development loans.

Market Area 

We serve the Seattle Metropolitan Statistical Area (&#147;MSA&#148;), which includes the city of Seattle, King County, Snohomish County, and Pierce County within the Puget Sound region, and Clallam and Jefferson Counties on the North Olympic Peninsula of Washington. We serve these markets through our main office in Seattle, five branch offices, two of which are located in the Seattle MSA, two that are located in Clallam County and one that is located in Jefferson County, and a loan production office located in the Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle. Based on the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC, our share of deposits in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA was approximately 0.18%, in King County approximately 0.10%, in Pierce County approximately 0.39% and in Snohomish County approximately 0.37%.

The following table illustrates the contractual maturity of our construction, land and commercial business loans at December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands). Loans that have adjustable or renegotiable interest rates are shown as maturing in the period during which the contract is due. The total amount of loans due after December 31, 2016, which have predetermined interest rates, is $21.2 million, while the total amount of loans due after such date, which have floating or adjustable interest rates, is $4.9 million. The table does not reflect the effects of possible prepayments or enforcement of due-on-sale clauses.

Lending Authority. Our President and Chief Executive Officer(CEO) may approve unsecured loans up to $1,000,000 and all types of secured loans up to 30% of our legal lending limit, or approximately $3.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer (CCO) may approve unsecured loans up to $400,000 and secured loans up to 15% of our legal lending limit, or approximately $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Any loans over the President and Chief Executive Officer&#146;s lending authority or loans otherwise outside our general underwriting guidelines must be approved by the Loan Committee. The Loan Committee consists of three independent directors, the CEO and the CCO. Lending authority is also granted to certain other lending staff at lower amounts, generally up to 7.5% of our legal lending limit for real estate secured loans and $50,000 for unsecured loans provided the loan has no policy exceptions. 

Largest Borrowing Relationships. At December 31, 2015, the maximum amount under federal law that we could lend to any one borrower and the borrower&#146;s related entities was approximately $11.5 million. Our five largest relationships totaled $35.3 million in the aggregate, or 7.7% of our $461.2 million gross loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015. The largest relationship was for $9.6 million in loans to businesses with common ownership collateralized by residential construction properties. The second largest relationship consists of $6.8 million in loans collateralized by multifamily construction properties. The next three largest lending relationships at December 31, 2015, were: $6.7 million in loans to businesses with common ownership collateralized by multifamily real estate; a $6.2 million loan collateralized by one-to-four family real estate; and $6.1 million in loans to businesses with common ownership collateralized by multifamily construction properties. At December 31, 2015, we had five other lending relationships that exceeded $4.5 million. All of the loans in these relationships were performing in accordance with their repayment terms as of December 31, 2015.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Lending. One of our primary lending activities is the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences, substantially all of which are secured by property located in our geographic lending area. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Over the past two years, the majority of our one- to four-family loan originations were fixed rate.

Most of our loans are underwritten using secondary market generally-accepted underwriting guidelines, and are readily saleable to Fannie Mae or other private investors. A portion of the one- to four-family loans we originate are retained in our portfolio while the majority are sold into the secondary market to Fannie Mae, with servicing retained for continued customer contact, relationship building and to increase noninterest income. We also originate a small portion of non-conforming loans for sale servicing released to certain correspondent purchasers. The sale of mortgage loans provides a source of non-interest income through the gain on sale, reduces our interest rate risk, provides a stream of servicing income, enhances liquidity and enables us to originate more loans at our current capital level than if we held them in portfolio. Our pricing strategy for mortgage loans includes establishing interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and consistent with 

our internal asset and liability management objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $107.4 million of one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans and $4.8 million one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgage (&#147;ARM&#148;) loans. See &#147;- Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Repayments and Servicing.&#148; At December 31, 2015, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (excluding loans held-for-sale) totaled $141.1 million, or 30.6%, of our gross loan portfolio, of which $129.8 million were fixed-rate loans and $11.4 million were ARM loans, compared to $133.0 million (excluding loans held-for-sale), or 30.8% of our gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014, of which $118.1 million were fixed-rate loans and $14.9 million were ARM loans.

Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we retain in our portfolio consist of loans that are &#147;non-conforming&#148; because they do not satisfy acreage limits, income, credit, conforming loan limits (i.e., jumbo mortgages) or various other requirements imposed by Fannie Mae. Some of these loans are also originated to meet the needs of borrowers who cannot otherwise satisfy Fannie Mae credit requirements because of personal and financial reasons (i.e., divorce, bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), and other aspects, which do not conform to Fannie Mae&#146;s guidelines. Such borrowers may have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements. We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans. We believe that these loans satisfy the needs of borrowers in our market area. As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans. We also retain &#147;jumbo&#148;, loans which exceed the conforming loan limits and therefore, not eligible to be purchased by Fannie Mae. At December 31, 2015, $72.8 million or 51.6% of our one- to four-family loan portfolio consisted of jumbo loans.

We generally underwrite our one- to four-family loans based on the applicant&#146;s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. We generally lend up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family first mortgage loans and non-owner occupied first mortgage loans. For first mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement in order to reduce our exposure to 80% or we charge a higher interest rate. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are generally appraised by independent fee appraisers who are selected in accordance with criteria approved by the Board of Directors. For loans that are less than $250,000, we may use the Home Value Estimator, an automated valuation model developed by Freddie Mac, in lieu of an appraisal. We typically require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated. Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one-to four-family loans. Our real estate loans generally contain a &#147;due on sale&#148; clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property. The average balance of our one- to four-family residential loans was approximately $258,000 at December 31, 2015.

Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities of up to 30 years; however, at December 31, 2015 we had $1.5 million of one- to four-family loans with an original contractual maturity of 40 years which were originated prior to 2009. All of these loans are fully amortizing, with payments due monthly. Our portfolio of fixed-rate loans also includes $13.4 million of loans with an initial seven year term and a 30-year amortization period with a borrower refinancing option at a fixed rate at the end of the initial term as long as the loan has met certain performance criterion. In addition, we had $33.9 million of one- to four- family loans with a five-year call option at December 31, 2015. Prior to 2012, we originated for portfolio five and seven year balloon reset loans (which are loans that are originated with a fixed interest rate for the initial five or seven years, and thereafter incur one interest rate change based on current market interest rates in which the new rate remains in effect for the remainder of the loan term) based on a 30-year amortization period. 

ARM loans are offered with annual adjustments and life-time rate caps that vary based on the product, generally with a maximum annual rate change of 2.0% and a maximum overall rate change of 6.0%. We generally use the rate on one-year Treasury Bills to re-price our ARM loans, however, $4.7 million of our ARM loans are to employees that re-price annually based on a margin of 1% over our average 12 month cost of funds. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on ARM loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Because of these characteristics, future yields on ARM loans may not be sufficient to offset increases in our cost of funds.

ARM loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower&#146;s payment rises, which increases the potential for default. The majority of these loans have been originated within the past several years, when rates were historically low. We continued to expand our fully amortizing ARM loans, by offering ARM loans with a fixed interest rate for the first one, three, five, or seven years, followed by a periodic adjustable interest rate for the remaining term. Given the recent market environment, however, the production of ARM loans has been substantially reduced because borrowers favor fixed rate mortgages.

Home Equity Lending. We originate home equity loans that consist of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate lines of credit. We typically originate home equity loans in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral, minus any senior liens on the property; however, prior to 2010 we originated home equity loans in amounts of up to 100% of the value of the collateral, minus any senior liens on the property. Home equity lines of credit are typically originated for up to $250,000 with an adjustable rate of interest, based on the one-year Treasury Bill rate plus a margin . Home equity lines of credit generally have up to a twelve-year draw period, during which time the funds may be paid down and redrawn up to the committed amount. Once the draw period has lapsed, the payment is amortized over a twelve-year period based on the loan balance at that time. We charge a $50 annual fee on each home equity line of credit and require monthly interest-only payments on the entire drawn amount during the draw period. At December 31, 2015, home equity loans totaled $31.6 million, or 6.9% of our gross loan portfolio compared to $34.7 million, or 8.0% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. Variable-rate home equity lines of credit at December 31, 2015 totaled $20.5 million, or 4.5% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $22.7 million, or 5.3% of our gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, unfunded commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled $12.0 million.

Our fixed-rate home equity loans are generally originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 80% of the appraised value of the subject property. These loans may have terms of up to 20 years and are fully amortizing. At December 31, 2015, fixed-rate home equity loans totaled $11.0 million, or 2.4% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $12.0 million, or 2.8% of our gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014.

Commercial and Multifamily Real Estate Lending. We offer a variety of commercial and multifamily loans. Most of these loans are secured by commercial income producing properties, including retail centers, multifamily apartment buildings, warehouses, and office buildings located in our market area. At December 31, 2015, commercial and multifamily loans totaled $175.3 million, or 38.0% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $169.0 million, or 39.1% of our gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014.

Loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate are generally originated with a variable interest rate, fixed for a five to ten-year term and a 20- to 25-year amortization period. At the end of the initial term, there is a balloon payment or the loan re-prices based on an independent index plus a margin of 1% to 4% for another five years. Loan-to-value ratios on our commercial and multifamily loans typically do not exceed 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan at origination.

Loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate are generally underwritten based on the net operating income of the property, quality and location of the real estate, the credit history and financial strength of the borrower and the quality of management involved with the property. The net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt plus an additional coverage requirement. We generally impose a minimum debt coverage ratio of approximately 1.20 for originated loans secured by income producing commercial properties. If the borrower is other than an individual, we generally require the personal guaranty of the borrower. We also generally require an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing commercial and multifamily loans are performed by independent state certified licensed fee appraisers and approved by the Loan Committee. In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on income-producing properties, the borrower is required to provide, at a minimum, annual financial information. From time to time we also acquire participation interests in commercial and multifamily loans originated by other financial institutions secured by properties located in our market area. On a case by case basis, we will consider loan participations where the collateral is located outside of our market area. 

Historically, loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties generally involve different credit risks than one- to four-family properties. These loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial and multifamily loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to four-family because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as one-to four-family. In addition, most of our commercial and multifamily loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. The largest single commercial and multifamily loan at December 31, 2015, totaled $4.0 million and is collateralized by a multifamily apartment building. At December 31, 2015 this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.

Construction and Land Lending. We originate construction loans secured by single-family residences and commercial and multifamily real estate. We also originate land and lot loans, which are secured by raw land or developed lots on which the borrower intends to build a residence, and land acquisition and development loans. At December 31, 2015, our construction and land loans totaled $57.0 million, or 12.4% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $46.3 million, or 10.7% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, unfunded construction loan commitments totaled $33.0 million.

Construction loans to individuals and contractors for the construction and acquisition of personal residences totaled $3.2 million, or 5.6% of our construction and land portfolio at December 31, 2015. We originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale. At December 31, 2015, construction loans to contractors for homes that were considered speculative totaled $33.9 million, or 59.4% of our construction and land portfolio. 

The composition of, and location of underlying collateral securing, our construction and land loan portfolio, excluding loan commitments, at December 31, 2015 was as follows (in thousands):

Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan generally either converts to a longer term mortgage loan or is paid off through a permanent loan from another lender. 

Residential construction loans are made up to the lesser of a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 100% of cost or 80% of appraised value at completion; however, we generally do not originate construction loans which exceed these limits without securing adequate private mortgage insurance or other form of credit enhancement to mitigate the higher loan to value.

At December 31, 2015, our largest residential construction loan commitment was for $2.0 million, $1.2 million of which had been disbursed. This loan was performing according to its terms. The average outstanding residential construction loan balance was approximately $539,450 at December 31, 2015. Before making a commitment to fund a residential construction loan, we require an appraisal of the subject property by an independent licensed appraiser. During the construction phase, we make periodic inspections of the construction site and loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the contractors or borrowers as construction progresses. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws during the construction period. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. We also require general liability, builder&#146;s risk hazard insurance, title insurance, and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located in or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) on all construction loans. 

We also originate developed lot and raw land loans to individuals intending to construct a residence in the future on the property. We will generally originate these loans in an amount up to 75% of the lower of the purchase price or appraisal. These lot and land loans are secured by a first lien on the property and have a fixed rate of interest with a maximum amortization of 20 years. At December 31, 2015, lot and land loans totaled $7.9 million, or 13.9% of our construction and land portfolio.

We make land acquisition and development loans to experienced builders or residential lot developers in our market area. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is generally 75% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project. We may not require any cash equity from the borrower if there is sufficient equity in the land being used as collateral. Development plans are required from developers prior to making the loan. Our loan officers are required to personally visit the proposed site of the development and the sites of competing developments. We require that developers maintain adequate insurance coverage. Land acquisition and development loans generally are originated with a loan term up to 24 months, have adjustable rates of interest based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or three or five- year Des Moines Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) Rate and require interest only payment during the term of the loan. Land acquisition and development loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant. We also require these loans to be paid on an accelerated basis as the lots are sold, so that we are repaid before all the lots are sold. 

We also offer commercial and multifamily construction loans. These loans are underwritten with terms similar to our permanent commercial real estate loans with special construction financing for up to 18 months under terms similar to our residential construction loans. Commercial and multifamily construction loans are made up to the lesser of a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 100% of cost or 80% of appraised value at completion. Most of our commercial and multifamily construction loans provide for disbursement of loan funds during the construction period and conversion to a permanent loan when the construction is complete, and either tenant lease-up provisions or prescribed debt service coverage ratios are met. At December 31, 2015, commercial and multifamily construction loans totaled $10.0 million, or 17.5% of our construction and land portfolio. 

Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Construction and development lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property&#146;s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, during the term of some of our construction loans, an interest reserve is created at origination and is added to the principal of the loan through the construction phase. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted at, or prior to, the maturity of the loan with a project value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers&#146; borrowing costs, thereby reducing the 

overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences as there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. Loans on land under development or held for future construction pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, on the success of the project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor themselves to repay principal and interest. 

Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans, including new and used manufactured homes, floating homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by deposit accounts. We also offer unsecured consumer loans. We originate our consumer loans primarily in our market area. All of our consumer loans are originated on a direct basis. At December 31, 2015, our consumer loans totaled $36.8 million, or 8.0% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $29.4 million, or 6.8% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2014.

We originate new and used manufactured home loans to borrowers who intend to use the home as a primary residence. The yields on these loans are higher than that on our other residential lending products and the portfolio has performed reasonably well with an acceptable level of risk and loss in exchange for the higher yield. Our weighted average yield on manufactured home loans at December 31, 2015 was 8.0%, compared to 4.6% for one- to four-family mortgages, excluding loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2015, these loans totaled $13.8 million, or 37.5% of our consumer loans and 3.0% of our gross loan portfolio. For used manufactured homes, loans are generally made up to 90% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price up to $200,000, and with terms typically up to 20 years. On new manufactured homes, loans are generally made up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price up to $200,000, and with terms typically up to 20 years. We generally charge a 1% fee at origination. We underwrite these loans based on our review of creditworthiness of the borrower, including credit scores, and the value of the collateral, for which we hold a security interest under Washington law.

Manufactured home loans are higher risk than loans secured by residential real property, though this risk is reduced if the owner also owns the land on which the home is located. A small portion of our manufactured home loans involve properties on which we also have financed the land for the owner. The primary risk in manufactured home loans is the difficulty in obtaining adequate value for the collateral due to the cost and limited ability to move the collateral. These loans tend to be made to retired individuals and first-time homebuyers. First-time homebuyers of manufactured homes tend to be a higher credit risk than first-time homebuyers of single family residences, due to more limited financial resources. As a result, these loans have a higher probability of default, higher delinquency rates and greater servicing and collateral recovery costs than single family residential loans and other types of consumer loans. We take into account this additional risk as a component of our allowance for loan losses methodology. We attempt to work out delinquent loans with the borrower and, if that is not successful, any repossessed manufactured homes are repossessed and sold. At December 31, 2015, there were three nonperforming manufactured home loan totaling $62,000 and we held one manufactured home valued at $10,000 in the repossessed assets portfolio.

We originate floating home, houseboat and house barge loans typically located on cooperative or condominium moorages. Terms vary from five to 20 years and have a fixed rate of interest. We lend up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price. The primary risk in floating home loans is the unique nature of the collateral and the challenges of relocating such collateral to a location other than where such housing is permitted. The process for securing the deed and/or the condominium or cooperative shares is also unique compared to other types of lending Sound Community Bank participates in. As a result, these loans may have higher collateral recovery costs than for one- to four-family mortgage loans and other types of consumer loans. We take into account these additional risks as a part of our underwriting processes and criteria. At December 31, 2015, floating home loans totaled $18.2 million, or 49.4% of our consumer loan portfolio and 4.0% of our gross loan portfolio.

The balance of our consumer loans include loans secured by new and used automobiles, new and used boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, loans secured by deposits and unsecured consumer loans, all of which, at December 31, 2015, totaled $4.8 million, or 13.0% of our consumer loan portfolio and 1.0%of our gross loan portfolio. Our automobile loan portfolio totaled $475,000 at December 31, 2015, or 1.3% of our consumer loan portfolio and 0.1% of our gross loan portfolio. Automobile loans may be written for a term up to 72 months and have fixed rates of interest. Loan-to-value ratios are up to 100% of the lesser of the purchase price or the National Automobile Dealers Association value for auto loans, including tax, licenses, title and mechanical breakdown and gap insurance.

Loans secured by boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles typically have terms from five to 20 years depending on the collateral and loan-to-value ratios up to 90%. These loans may be made with fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our unsecured consumer loans have either a fixed rate of interest generally for a maximum term of 48 months, or are revolving lines of credit of generally up to $25,000. At December 31, 2015, unsecured consumer loans totaled $1.2 million and unfunded commitments on our unsecured consumer lines of credit totaled $1.4 million. At that date, the average outstanding balance on these lines was less than $1,000.

Consumer loans (other than our manufactured and floating homes) generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.

Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as manufactured homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#146;s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.

Commercial Business Lending. At December 31, 2015, commercial business loans totaled $19.3 million, or 4.2% of our gross loan portfolio, compared to $19.5 million, or 4.5% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. Substantially all of our commercial business loans have been to borrowers in our market area. Our commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance commercial vehicles and equipment. Approximately $1.3 million of our commercial business loans at December 31, 2015 were unsecured. Our commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower&#146;s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower&#146;s capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower&#146;s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally require personal guarantees on both our secured and unsecured commercial business loans. Nonetheless, commercial business loans are believed to carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans.

Our interest rates on commercial business loans are dependent on the type of loan. Our secured commercial business loans typically have a loan to value ratio of up to 80% and are term loans ranging from three to seven years. Secured commercial business term loans generally have a fixed rated based on the commensurate FHLB amortizing rate or prime rate as reported in the West Coast edition of the Wall Street Journal plus 1% to 3%. In addition, we typically charge loan fees of 1% to 2% of the principal amount at origination, depending on the credit quality and account relationships of the borrower. Business lines of credit are usually adjustable-rate and are based on the prime rate plus 1% to 3%, and are generally originated with both a floor and ceiling to the interest rate. Our business lines of credit generally have terms ranging from 12 months to 24 months and provide for interest-only monthly payments during the term.

Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers&#146; cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may 

be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the specific type of business and equipment used. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions).

Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Repayments and Servicing 

We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate loans, however, is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market area. Over the past few years, we have continued to originate residential and consumer loans, and increased our emphasis on commercial and multifamily, construction and land, and commercial business lending. Demand is affected by competition and the interest rate environment. During the past few years, we, like many other financial institutions, have experienced significant prepayments on loans due to the low interest rate environment prevailing in the United States. In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate large dollar volumes of real estate loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in interest income. If a proposed loan exceeds our internal lending limits, we may originate the loan on a participation basis with another financial institution. From time to time, we also participate with other financial institutions on loans they originate. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we sold commercial loan participations with other financial institutions in the amount of $6.9 million, $5.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We underwrite loan purchases and participations to the same standards as an internally-originated loan. We did not purchase any loan participations in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, we purchased commercial loan participations with other financial institutions in the amount of $166,000 and $5.3 million, respectively. 

We do not actively engage in originating &#147;alt A&#148; loans, option adjustable rate or subprime loans and have no established program to originate or purchase these loans. We do offer interest-only one- to four- family loans to well-qualified borrowers and at December 31, 2015, we held $7.5 million of such loans in our loan portfolio, representing 1.62% of our gross loan portfolio. Subprime loans are defined as loans that at the time of loan origination had a FICO credit score of less than 660. Of the $107.4 million in one- to four- family loans originated in 2015, only $1.0 million, or 0.09%, were to borrowers with a credit score under 660. We obtain updated FICO scores on all of our borrowers periodically and based on the most recently updated score, $19.4 million, or 4.2% of our gross loan portfolio would be deemed subprime at December 31, 2015. Based on the FICO score as of December 31, 2015, our subprime portfolio included approximately $12.6 million in one- to four-family mortgage loans, $4.0 million in home equity loans, $2.2 million in manufactured home loans, $319,000 in construction and land loans, and $257,000 in other consumer loans or $19.4 million in the aggregate , representing 4.2% of our loan portfolio. 

In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and other miscellaneous services.

We also sell whole one-to four-family loans without recourse to Fannie Mae, subject to a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant. These loans are fixed-rate mortgages, which primarily are sold to improve our interest rate risk. These loans are generally sold for cash in amounts equal to the unpaid principal amount of the loans determined using present value yields to the buyer. These sales allow for a servicing fee on loans when the servicing is retained by us. Most one- to four-family loans are sold with servicing retained. At December 31, 2015, we were servicing a $360.4 million portfolio of residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae. No loans were repurchased from Fannie Mae in 2015 and two loans were repurchased from Fannie Mae totaling $453,000 in 2014. 

We earned mortgage servicing income of $840,000, $509,000 and $457,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In November 2009, we acquired a $340.1 million loan servicing portfolio from Leader Financial Services. These loans are 100% owned by Fannie Mae and are subserviced under an agreement with a third party loan servicer who performs all servicing including payment processing, reporting and collections. 

These mortgage servicing rights are carried at fair value and had a value at December 31, 2015 of $3.2 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales of whole real estate loans can be beneficial to us since these sales generally generate income at the time of sale, produce future servicing income on loans where servicing is retained, provide funds for additional lending, and increase liquidity. We sold $72.6 million, $52.7 million and $108.9 million of one- to four- family loans 

during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of one-to four-family loans and participations are recognized at the time of the sale. Our net gain on sales of residential loans for all of 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1.3 million, $624,000 and $967,000, respectively. In addition to loans sold to Fannie Mae on a servicing retained basis, we also sell certain loans to correspondent banks on a servicing released basis. In 2015, we sold $2.9 million of loans servicing released.

The increase in originations in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to a modest decrease in interest rates which spurred the increase in one- to four-family origination and our increased emphasis on originating commercial and multifamily real estate loans in 2015 compared to 2014. One- to four- family home purchases continued to be strong in our market area due to the economic environment and the rate of unemployment in our markets although it has somewhat been hampered due to the lack of overall supply, especially in the Seattle area. Demand for multi-family and construction loans continued to be strong in our markets due to continued demand for new homes and apartments.

Asset Quality 

When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a one-to four-family loan, we attempt to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower. In the case of loans secured by a one-to four-family property, a late notice typically is sent 15 days after the due date, and the borrower is contacted by phone within 30 days after the due date. Generally, a delinquency letter is also mailed to the borrower. All delinquent accounts are reviewed by a loan officer or branch manager who attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower once the loan is 30 days past due. If the account becomes 60 days delinquent and an acceptable repayment plan has not been agreed upon, we generally refer the account to legal counsel with instructions to prepare a notice of intent to foreclose. The notice of intent to foreclose allows the borrower up to 30 days to bring the account current. If foreclosed, typically we take title to the property and sell it directly through a real estate broker.

Delinquent consumer loans, as well as delinquent home equity loans and lines of credit, are handled in a similar manner to one-to four-family loans, except that appropriate action may be taken to collect any loan payment that is delinquent for more than 15 days. Once the loan is 90 days past due, it is classified as nonaccrual. Generally, credits are charged-off at 120 days past due, unless the Loss Mitigation Department provides support for continuing collection efforts. Our procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by us that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.

Delinquent loans are initially handled by the loan officer or branch manager in charge of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower. The Loss Mitigation Department also works with the lenders to see that the necessary steps are taken to collect delinquent loans. In addition, management meets with all of the loan officers and reviews past due and classified loans, as well as other loans that management feels may present possible collection problems, which are reported to the board on a quarterly basis. If an acceptable workout of a delinquent loan cannot be agreed upon, we generally initiate foreclosure or repossession proceedings on any collateral securing the loan.

(1) Nonperforming loans include $971,000, $2.3 million, $1.0 million, $828,000 and $2.8 million in nonperforming troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

There were no nonperforming commercial and multifamily estate loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming one- to four- family loans increased $128,000 to $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $1.5 million at December 31, 2014. Our largest nonperforming loan at December 31, 2015 was a one-to-four- family loan totaling $324,000. The balance in nonperforming one- to four- family loans at December 31, 2015 consisted of 12 loans to different borrowers with an average loan balance of $137,000.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded had the nonaccrual loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $104,000, all of which was excluded from interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014 -- Delinquencies and Nonperforming Assets&#148; for more information on troubled assets.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans . Troubled debt restructurings (&#147;TDRs), which are accounted for under Accounting Codification Standard (&#147;ASC&#148;) 310-40, are loans which have renegotiated loan terms to assist borrowers who are unable to meet the original terms of their loans. Such modifications to loan terms may include a lower interest rate, a reduction in principal, or a longer term to maturity. All TDRs are initially classified as impaired, regardless of whether the loan was performing at the time it was restructured. Once a troubled debt restructuring has performed according to its modified terms for six months and the collection of principal and interest under the revised terms is deemed probable, we remove the TDR from nonperforming status. At December 31, 2015, we had $5.1 million of loans that were classified as performing TDRs and still on accrual. Included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were troubled debt restructured loans of $971,000 and $2.3 million, respectively.

OREO and Repossessed Assets . OREO and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans. At December 31, 2015, OREO and repossessed assets totaled $769,000. Our largest OREO property as of December 31, 2015 was a commercial real estate property which was acquired in 2014 as a part of the three branches purchased from another financial institution. It was originally classified as a fixed asset and was subsequently reclassified to OREO in 2015.

Other Loans of Concern . In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2015, there were 14 loans totaling $3.3 million with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the nonperforming asset categories. The majority of these loans have been considered individually in management&#146;s determination of our allowance for loan losses. The largest loans of concern at December 31, 2015, were a $1.3 million loan secured by residential property in King County, Washington and a $185,000 loan secured by residential property in Snohomish County, Washington. Other loans of concern included $271,000 in residential first mortgages, $293,000 in home equity loans, $43,000 in manufactured home loans, and $5,000 in other consumer loans. Loans of concern had specific loan loss reserves of $144,000 at December 31, 2015. 

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets (such as OREO and repossessed assets), debt and equity securities considered, as &#147;substandard,&#148; &#147;doubtful&#148; or &#147;loss.&#148; An asset is considered &#147;substandard&#148; if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. &#147;Substandard&#148; assets include those characterized by the &#147;distinct possibility&#148; that the insured institution will sustain &#147;some loss&#148; if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &#147;doubtful&#148; have all of the weaknesses in those classified &#147;substandard,&#148; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make &#147;collection or liquidation in full,&#148; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, &#147;highly questionable and improbable.&#148; Assets classified as &#147;loss&#148; are those considered &#147;uncollectible&#148; and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.

When we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent to address specific impairments. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off those assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and, since our conversion to a Washington chartered commercial bank, the WDFI, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances. Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated as special mention. At December 31, 2015, special mention assets totaled $2.9 million. 

We regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management&#146;s review of our assets, at December 31, 2015, we had classified $3.7 million of our assets as substandard, of which $2.5 million represented a variety of outstanding loans, $449,000 represented non-agency mortgage backed securities, and the remaining balance OREO and repossessed assets. At that date, we had no assets classified as doubtful or loss. This total amount of classified assets represented 6.9% of our equity capital and 0.7% of our assets at December 31, 2015. Classified assets totaled $6.1 million, or 12.0% of our equity capital and 1.2% of our assets at December 31, 2014.

Allowance for Loan Losses . We maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable loan losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing, monthly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower&#146;s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as one-to four-family, small commercial and multifamily, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors and peer group data adjusted for current economic conditions. More complex loans, such as commercial and multifamily loans and commercial business loans, are evaluated individually for impairment, primarily through the evaluation of the borrower&#146;s net operating income and available cash flow and their possible impact on collateral values.

At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $4.6 million, or 1.01% of our total loan portfolio, compared to $4.4 million, or 1.02% of our total loan portfolio in 2014. Specific valuation reserves totaled $882,000 and $367,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Assessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, properly reflects estimated probable loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

Economic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession, however, economic growth has been slow and uneven, presenting an unusually challenging environment for bank and their holding companies, including us. Property values, which began improving in 2013, have generally stabilized, although for some loans they are still lower than when many of the related loans were originated. Recent trends in housing prices and unemployment rates in our market areas are generally reflecting continuing improvement. The increase in our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans ratio during 2015 was a result of a decrease in nonperforming loans during the last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 217.65% and 114.19% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The distribution of our allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

Investment Activities 

State commercial banks have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, including callable agency securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers&#146; acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, state commercial banks may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that the institution is otherwise authorized to make directly. See &#147;- How We Are Regulated &#8211; Sound Community Bank&#148; for a discussion of additional restrictions on our investment activities.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have the responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio, subject to the direction and guidance of the Board of Directors. These officers consider various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.

The general objectives of our investment portfolio will be to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Our investment quality will emphasize safer investments with the yield on those investments secondary to not taking unnecessary risk with the available funds. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Asset/Liability Management.&#148;

At December 31, 2015, we owned $2.2 million FHLB stock. As a condition of membership at the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio and other investments at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2015, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital.

(1) Our non-agency mortgage backed securities consist of one security purchased at a discount which had an unrealized loss of $21,000 as of December 31, 2015. This security has performed and paid principal and interest each month as contractually committed. 

The composition and maturities of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2015, excluding FHLB stock, are as follows: Municipal bonds with an amortized cost of $1.9 million and a fair value of $2.1 million and a final maturity in five to ten years, federal agency mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 million and a fair value of $4.2 million and a final maturity greater than ten years and one non-agency mortgage-backed security with an amortized cost of $449,000 and a fair value of $428,000 and a final maturity greater than ten years. 

We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment (&#147;OTTI&#148;) taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. For debt securities, if we intend to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an OTTI. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected.

Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI. The remaining impairment related to all other factors, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value, is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income. Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within other comprehensive income. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized no non-cash OTTI charges on our investment securities. One agency security and one non-agency mortgage-backed security had unrealized losses but management determined the decline in value was not related to specific credit deterioration. We do not intend to sell this security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell this securities before anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. We closely monitor our investment securities for changes in credit risk. The current market environment significantly limits our ability to mitigate our exposure to valuation changes in this security by selling it. If market conditions deteriorate and we determine our holdings of this security or other investment securities are OTTI, our future earnings, shareholders&#146; equity, regulatory capital and continuing operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Sources of Funds 

General . Our sources of funds are primarily deposits (including deposits from public entities), borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans and investments and funds provided from operations. 

Deposits . We offer a variety of deposit accounts to both consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, now accounts, demand accounts and certificates of deposit. We solicit deposits primarily in our market area; however, at December 31, 2015, approximately 3.8% of our deposits were from persons outside the State of Washington. As of December 31, 2015, core deposits, which we define as our non-time deposit accounts and time deposit accounts less than $250,000, represented approximately 85.7% of total deposits, compared to 86.9% and 87.0% as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits and we expect to continue these practices in the future.

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. We have become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate sensitive. We manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to competitive factors. Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

Interest-bearing demand accounts increased during the last three years primarily as a result of a continued marketing emphasis on our rewards checking product as well a competitively priced interest-bearing demand account. This product is priced and marketed similarly to a money market account, however it does not have the monthly withdrawal and outgoing transfer restrictions like savings and money market accounts. The increase in 

noninterest-bearing demand accounts was primarily a result of our continued emphasis on attracting relatively low-cost core deposit accounts from small businesses. The decrease in money market accounts was primarily the result of customers placing these funds in higher yielding interest-bearing demand accounts. In addition, during 2014, we acquired three retail branches on the North Olympic Peninsula with $21.6 million in deposits upon acquisition of which $19.3 million were retained as of December 31, 2014. The increase in certificates during 2014 was primarily a result of several targeted marketing initiatives offering interest rates slightly above market rates. 

We are a public funds depository and as of December 31, 2015, we had $48.6 million in public funds. These funds consisted of $48.1 million in certificates of deposit, $141,000 in money market accounts and $343,000 in checking accounts at December 31, 2015. These accounts must be 100% collateralized if the amount on deposit exceeds FDIC insurance of $250,000. We use letters of credit from the FHLB as collateral for these funds.

Borrowings . Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may utilize borrowings as a cost-effective source of funds when they can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, for additional capacity to fund loan demand, or to meet our asset/liability management goals. Our borrowings currently consist of advances from the FHLB. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are a member of and obtain advances from the FHLB, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility for their member institutions. These advances are provided upon the security of certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features, and all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. We have entered into a loan agreement with the FHLB pursuant to 

which Sound Community Bank may borrow up to approximately 35% of its total assets, secured by a blanket pledge on a portion of our residential mortgage portfolio including one- to four family first and second mortgage loans, and commercial and multifamily loans. Based on eligible collateral, the total amount available under this agreement as of December 31, 2015 was $174.0 million. At the same date, we had $40.4 million in FHLB advances outstanding with maturities between zero and three years. We also had outstanding letters of credit from the FHLB with a notional amount of $47.5 million at December 31, 2015. We plan to rely in part on long-term FHLB advances to fund asset and loan growth. We also use short-term advances to meet short term liquidity needs. We are required to own stock in the FHLB based on the amount of our advances.

From time to time, we also may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco&#146;s &#147;discount window&#148; for overnight liquidity needs, although we have not borrowed from the discount window in recent years.

Subsidiary and Other Activities 

Sound Financial Bancorp has one subsidiary, Sound Community Bank. 

Competition 

We face competition in attracting deposits and originating loans. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial financial institutions, credit unions, life insurance companies and mortgage brokers. Other savings banks, commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. Commercial business competition is primarily from local commercial banks, but other savings banks and credit unions also compete for this business. We compete by consistently delivering high-quality, personal service to our customers which results in a high level of customer satisfaction.

Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money center and regional banks that have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in Washington and other western states. These include such large national lenders as US Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Key Bank and others in our market area that have greater resources than we do and may offer services that we do not provide. Customers who seek &#147;one-stop shopping&#148; may be drawn to institutions that offer services that we do not.

We attract our deposits through our branch office system. Competition for those deposits is principally from savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions, as well as mutual funds and other alternative investments. We compete for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. Based on the most recent data provided by the FDIC, there are approximately 57 other commercial banks and savings institutions operating in the Seattle MSA. Based on the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC, our share of deposits in the Seattle MSA was approximately 0.18%. The five largest financial institutions 

in that area have 23.25% of those deposits. In Clallam County there are 11 other commercial banks and savings institutions. Our share of deposits in Clallam County was the second highest in the county at 14.19%, with the five largest institutions in that county having 72.57% of the deposits. In Jefferson County there are seven other commercial banks and savings banks. Our share of deposits in Jefferson County is estimated to be 4.04%, with the five largest institutions in that county have 76.17% of those deposits.

How We Are Regulated 

General . On December 28, 2012 Sound Community Bank converted from a federally chartered savings bank to a Washington state-chartered commercial bank. As a Washington commercial bank, Sound Community Bank&#146;s regulators are the WDFI and the FDIC, rather than the OCC. The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Sound Financial Bancorp. A brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank is set forth below. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Washington State Legislature that may affect the operations of Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

The WDFI and FDIC have extensive enforcement authority over Sound Community Bank. The Federal Reserve has the same type of authority over Sound Financial Bancorp. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist orders and removal orders and initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the regulators.

Regulatory Reform . On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that will affect us.

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to our operations:

&#8226; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;), an independent consumer compliance regulatory agency within the Federal Reserve, has been established. The CFPB is empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority over financial institutions with total assets over $10 billion with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Smaller financial institutions, like Sound Community Bank, are subject to supervision and enforcement by their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. The CFPB also has authority to promulgate new consumer financial protection regulations and amend existing consumer financial protection regulations. 

&#8226; The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. 

&#8226; The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed. 

&#8226; Deposit insurance increased to $250,000. 

&#8226; The deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance is the depository institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period. 

&#8226; The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base; however, the FDIC is directed to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a rule setting a designated reserve ratio at 2.0% of insured deposits. 

&#8226; Tier 1 capital treatment for &#147;hybrid&#148; capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. The federal banking agencies have promulgated new rules 

on regulatory capital for both depository institutions and their holding companies, to include leverage capital and risk-based capital measures at least as stringent as those now applicable to Sound Community Bank under the prompt corrective action regulations. See &#147;-Capital Rules&#148;

&#8226; A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments. 

&#8226; Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain &#147;significant&#148; matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant. 

&#8226; Stock exchanges, not including the OTC Bulletin Board, are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation that is based on financial information required to be reported under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information. 

Regulation of Sound Community Bank 

General . Sound Community Bank, as a state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the WDFI. As an insured institution, it also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of Sound Community Bank to the maximum permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may require Sound Community Bank to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact our capital and earnings. This regulation of Sound Community Bank is intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders of Sound Community Bank or Sound Financial Bancorp. Sound Community Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to certain limitations on the payment of dividends to Sound Financial Bancorp. See &#147;- Capital Rules&#148; and &#147;-Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions.&#148; 

Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions . As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered commercial banks, the WDFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a cease-and-desist order against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations of compliance status of a commercial bank.

Regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC . State law and regulations govern Sound Community Bank&#146;s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make other loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state commercial bank, Sound Community Bank must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the WDFI. 

Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington commercial banks as federally and other-state chartered savings institutions and banks with branches in Washington. Washington law allows Washington commercial banks to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the WDFI may approve applications by Washington commercial banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity, if it determines that the activity is closely related to banking, and Sound Community Bank is otherwise qualified under the statute. 

Federal law generally limits the activities, subsidiary investments and activities, and equity investments of Sound Community Bank, as principal, to those that are permissible for national banks, unless approved by the FDIC. Our relationship with our depositors and borrowers is regulated to a great extent by federal laws and regulations, especially with respect to disclosure requirements. 

The FDIC has adopted regulatory guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and information systems, audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other benefits. If the FDIC determines that Sound Community Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by these guidelines, it may require Sound Community Bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 

Among these safety and soundness standards are FDIC regulations that require Sound Community Bank to adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for real estate loans. These standards, which must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value ratio limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. Sound Community Bank is obligated to monitor conditions in its real estate markets to ensure that its standards continue to be appropriate for current market conditions. Sound Community Bank&#146;s board of directors is required to review and approve Sound Community Bank&#146;s standards at least annually. The FDIC has published guidelines for compliance with these regulations, including supervisory limitations on loan-to-value ratios for different categories of real estate loans. Under the guidelines, the aggregate level of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios should not exceed an aggregate limit of 100% of total capital, and within the aggregate limit, the total of all loans for commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-one-to-four-family residential properties should not exceed 30% of total capital. 

Loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratio limitations must be identified in Sound Community Bank&#146;s records and reported at least quarterly to Sound Community Bank&#146;s Board of Directors. Sound Community Bank is in compliance with the record and reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2015, Sound Community Bank&#146;s aggregate loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios were $7.8 million.

The FDIC and the WDFI must approve any merger transaction involving Sound Community Bank as the acquirer, including an assumption of deposits from another depository institution. The FDIC generally is authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described below. The Dodd-Frank Act permits interstate branching for banks by establishing de novo branches.

Insurance of Accounts . The Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in Sound Community Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. 

The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each FDIC-insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories applied to its deposits, subject to certain adjustments. Each institution with less than $10 billion in assets is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital levels, supervisory ratings and other factors. Well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to Risk Category I. Risk Categories II, III and IV present progressively greater risks to the DIF.

Under the FDIC&#146;s regulations for deposit insurance assessments, the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. The FDIC assessment rates range from approximately 5 basis points to 35 basis points, subject to applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution, brokered deposits and unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions, until such time as the FDIC&#146;s reserve ratio equals 1.15%. When the FDIC&#146;s reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from 3 basis points to 30 basis points (subject to adjustments as described above). When the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from 2 basis points to 28 basis points and if the reserve ratio for prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from 1 basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.

As required by the Dodd Frank Act, the FDIC has proposed a rule to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF by imposing a surcharge on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and ending when it reaches 1.35%. This surcharge period is expected to begin in 2016 and end by December 31, 2018. Smaller institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The credit will apply to reduce regular assessments by 2.0 basis points for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.40%.

Transactions with Related Parties . Transactions between Sound Community Bank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to Sound Community Bank as transactions with non-affiliates, and certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of Sound Community Bank&#146;s capital and require eligible collateral in specified amounts. Sound Financial Bancorp is an affiliate of Sound Community Bank.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by Sound Financial Bancorp to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, Sound Community Bank&#146;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (&#147;insiders&#148;), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that Sound Community Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on Sound Community Bank&#146;s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated borrowers and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.

Capital Rules . Effective January 1, 2015 (with some provisions transitioned into full effectiveness over several years), Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank are subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 (&#147;CET1&#148;) capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, as discussed below, and certain minority interests, all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally includes CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most intangible assets, subject to certain adjustments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Tier 2 capital, which is limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital, includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible debt, term subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock; however, the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may be included in Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. Risk-weighted assets are determined under the capital regulations, which assign risk-weights to all assets and to certain off-balance sheet items.

The new regulations include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, unless an institution elects to opt out of such inclusion, if eligible to do so. We have elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in our capital calculations. 

The new capital regulations include a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% risk weight for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying 

dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement is phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.

Under the FDIC&#146;s prompt corrective action standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, a bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%, and a leverage ratio of 5%. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, a bank must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Institutions with lower capital ratios are assigned to lower capital categories. Based on safety and soundness concerns, the FDIC may assign an institution to a lower capital category than would originally apply based on its capital ratios. The FDIC is also authorized to require Sound Community Bank to maintain additional amounts of capital in connection with concentrations of assets, interest rate risk, and certain other items. The FDIC has not imposed such a requirement on Sound Community Bank.

An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. An institution that is not at least adequately capitalized is subject to numerous additional restrictions, and a guaranty by its holding company is required. An institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 20% or less is subject to appointment of the FDIC as receiver if its capital level does not improve in timely fashion. When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution. 

As of December 31, 2015, Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank are well-capitalized under the capital rules and we anticipate that we will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.

Volcker Rule Regulations . Regulations were adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of banks and their holding companies and the affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds, and certain other investments, including certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations and others.

Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws . In connection with its lending and other activities, Sound Community Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;). Among other things, these laws:

&#8226; require lenders to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways; 

&#8226; prohibit discrimination against an applicant in a credit transaction; 

&#8226; prohibit discrimination in housing-related lending activities; 

&#8226; require certain lenders to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding home; 

&#8226; require lenders to provide borrowers with information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements; 

&#8226; prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate loan transactions; 

&#8226; require financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs and measures to protect the confidentiality of consumer financial information; and 

&#8226; prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations. 

The CFPB has authority for amending existing consumer compliance regulations and implementing new regulations, and is charged with examining the compliance of financial institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion with these consumer protection rules. Sound Community Bank&#146;s compliance with consumer protection rules is examined by the WDFI and the FDIC since it does not meet this $10 billion asset level threshold.

In addition, federal regulations limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties.

The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency to assess the bank&#146;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The FDIC examines Sound Community Bank for compliance with its CRA obligations. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#147;outstanding,&#148; &#147;satisfactory,&#148; &#147;needs to improve,&#148; or &#147;substantial non-compliance&#148; and the appropriate federal banking agency is to take this rating into account in the evaluation of certain applications of the institution, such as an application relating to a merger or the establishment of a branch. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for the denial of such an application. The CRA also requires that all institutions make public disclosures of their CRA ratings. Sound Community Bank received a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent CRA evaluation. Under the law of the state of Washington, Sound Community Bank has a similar obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves, and is subject to examination by the WDFI for this purpose, including assignment of a rating. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denial of certain applications by the WDFI.

Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws . Sound Community Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require Sound Community Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#146;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.

Federal Home Loan Bank System . Sound Community Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, one of the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, Sound Community Bank is required to hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2015, Sound Community Bank had $2.2 million in Federal Home Loan Bank stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. Sound Community Bank received $13,000 in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Federal Home Loan Banks have continued to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of Federal Home Loan Bank dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock in the future. A reduction in value of Sound Community Bank&#146;s Federal Home Loan Bank stock may result in a corresponding reduction in its capital.

Regulation of Sound Financial Bancorp 

General . Sound Financial Bancorp, as the sole shareholder of Sound Community Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that Sound Financial Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of Sound Community Bank.

As a bank holding company, Sound Financial Bancorp is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and to examination by the WDFI. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue 

cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

A merger or acquisition of Sound Financial Bancorp, or an acquisition of control of Sound Financial Bancorp, is generally subject to approval by the Federal Reserve and WDFI. In general, control for this purpose means 25% of voting stock, but such approval can be required in other circumstances, including but not limited to an acquisition of as low as 5% of voting stock.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks, with the ability to provide financial assistance to a subsidiary bank in financial distress. Regulations to implement this provision are required, but to date, none have been promulgated.

Permissible Activities . Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers&#146; checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designed as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities.

The Federal Reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank, and may approve an acquisition located in a state other than the holding company&#146;s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state, but may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state, or an application where the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank&#146;s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.

Capital Requirements for Sound Financial Bancorp . Effective January 1, 2015, Sound Financial Bancorp is subject to the capital rules described under the caption &#147;Capital Rules&#148; above. The Federal Reserve expects a holding company&#146;s subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. In addition, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries. 

Federal Securities Law . The stock of Sound Financial Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sound Financial Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Sound Financial Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of Sound Financial Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. For this purpose, affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If Sound Financial Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Sound Financial Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.

The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to Sound Financial Bancorp as a registered company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of these requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley-related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules.

Limitations on Dividends and Stock Repurchases 

Sound Financial Bancorp . Sound Financial Bancorp&#146;s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s limits, including the capital conservation buffer requirement, and Maryland law, and may depend on its ability to receive dividends from Sound Community Bank. 

A policy of the Federal Reserve limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company&#146;s net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company subject to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, such as Sound Financial Bancorp, is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1 and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it is inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.

Except for a company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement with the Federal Reserve. Regardless of its asset size, a bank holding company is considered well-capitalized if on a consolidated basis it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, and is not subject to an agreement, order, or directive to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. 

Under Maryland corporate law, Sound Financial Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.

Sound Community Bank . The amount of dividends payable by Sound Community Bank to Sound Financial Bancorp depends upon Sound Community Bank&#146;s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the new capital conservation buffer requirement. Sound Community Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if the payment would cause its net worth to be reduced below the amount required for its liquidation account. Dividends on Sound Community Bank&#146;s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of Sound Community Bank without the approval of the WDFI. 

The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by Sound Community Bank&#146;s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further provides that without prior approval no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be less than adequately capitalized as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the FDIC has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if Sound Community Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC.

Federal Taxation 

General . We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Sound Financial Bancorp or Sound Community Bank. Our federal income tax returns have never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.

We had no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 and at December 31, 2014. 

Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, we currently report our income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing our federal income tax return.

Minimum Tax . The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain items of tax preference and adjustment, called alternative minimum taxable income. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent that the taxpayer&#146;s alternative minimum tax is in excess of the taxpayer&#146;s regular tax. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the alternative minimum tax in prior years, nor do we have any such amounts available as credits for carryover.

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . Sound Financial Bancorp has elected to file a consolidated return with Sound Community Bank. Therefore any dividends Sound Financial Bancorp receives from Sound Community Bank will not be included as income to Sound Financial Bancorp.

State Taxation 

We are subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.5% of gross receipts. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax.

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of 98 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good.

Executive Officers of Sound Financial Bancorp and Sound Community Bank
