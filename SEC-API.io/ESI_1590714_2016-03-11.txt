Business Overview 

Platform is a global, diversified producer of high-technology specialty chemical products. Our business involves the formulation of a broad range of solutions-oriented specialty chemicals, which are sold into multiple industries, including agricultural, animal health, electronics, graphic arts, plating, offshore oil and gas production and drilling. We refer to our products as &#8220;dynamic chemistries&#8221; due to their intricate chemical compositions. Our dynamic chemistries are used in a wide variety of attractive niche markets and we believe that the majority of our operations hold strong positions in the product markets they serve. 

As our name &#8220;Platform Specialty Products Corporation&#8221; implies, we continually seek opportunities to act as an acquirer and consolidator of specialty chemical businesses on a global basis, particularly those meeting Platform&#8217;s &#8220;Asset-Lite, High-Touch&#8221; philosophy, which involves the following core elements: 

&#8226; prioritizing extensive resources to research and development; 

&#8226; offering highly technical customer service; and 

&#8226; managing conservatively our investments in fixed assets and capital expenditures. 

Our strategy is to acquire and maintain leading positions in niche sectors of high-growth markets. We regularly review acquisition opportunities and may acquire businesses that meet our acquisition criteria when we deem it to be financially and fiscally prudent. In addition, we believe that our global footprint, innovative technology and process know-how, strong commitment to research and development, dedication to customer service, expertise in distribution and registration and a broad range of solution-oriented proprietary and value-added products allow us to maintain strong market share positions. We believe our product innovations and product extensions will continue to drive sales growth in both new and existing markets while also expanding margins. We believe savings from operational efficiencies from supply chain, distribution and production costs synergies will also provide increased cash flow from operations. 

We report two business segments: Performance Solutions and Agricultural Solutions, as described below under "Business Segments." 

History and Corporate Information 

We were initially incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on April 23, 2013 under the name &#8220;Platform Acquisition Holdings Limited.&#8221; We completed our Initial Public Offering in the United Kingdom on May 22, 2013, raising net proceeds of approximately $881 million, and our ordinary shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange. 

Concurrently with the closing of the MacDermid Acquisition (see "2013 Activity" below), we changed our name to &#8220;Platform Specialty Products Corporation.&#8221; On January 22, 2014, we completed our Domestication, and on January 23, 2014, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;PAH.&#8221; 

Acquisitions 

2015 Activity 

Alent Acquisition &#32;- On December 1, 2015, we completed the Alent Acquisition by acquiring all of the issued shares of Alent for approximately $1.74 billion &#32;in cash, net of acquired cash, and 18,419,738 &#32;shares of our common stock issued to Alent shareholders, including Cevian Capital II Master Fund LP, the then largest shareholder of Alent. Legacy Alent was a global supplier of specialty chemicals and engineered materials used primarily in electronics, automotive and industrial applications, and a supplier of high performance consumable products and services. Alent's business is included in our Performance Solutions business segment which now combines the legacy MacDermid operations, Alent's Enthone Surface Chemistries and Alpha Assembly Materials businesses, and the OMG Businesses.

OMG Acquisition &#32;- On October 28, 2015, we completed the OMG Acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately $237 million &#32;in cash, net of acquired cash, subject to purchase price adjustments. The acquired OMG Businesses are included in our Performance Solutions business segment. We believe the legacy OMG Businesses are in line with our business strategy of growing into niche markets. OMG&#8217;s Electronic Chemicals business is similar to the legacy MacDermid electronic chemical and surface treatment businesses, as it develops, produces and supplies chemicals for electronic and industrial applications. OMG&#8217;s Photomasks products are used by customers to produce semiconductors and related products. 

Arysta Acquisition &#32;- On February 13, 2015, we completed the Arysta Acquisition for approximately $3.50 billion , consisting of $2.86 billion &#32;in cash, net of acquired cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments, and the issuance of $600 million of Platform&#8217;s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The legacy Arysta business is included in our Agricultural Solutions business segment. Arysta has a solutions-oriented business model which focuses on product innovation to address grower needs, complementing the legacy Agriphar and CAS businesses. We acquired Arysta to expand our presence in the agrochemical business and our offering of products and solutions utilizing globally managed patented, proprietary off-patent agrochemical AIs and biosolutions, as well as off-patent agrochemical products. 

2014 Activity 

CAS Acquisition - On November 3, 2014, we completed the CAS Acquisition for $1.04 billion , consisting of $983 million &#32;in cash, net of acquired cash, after certain post-closing working capital and other adjustments, and 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. Legacy CAS was a niche provider of seed treatments and agrochemical products for a wide variety of crop protection applications in numerous geographies. 

Agriphar Acquisition - On October 1, 2014, we completed the Agriphar Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately &#8364;300 million ( $370 million ), consisting of $350 million &#32;in cash, net of acquired cash and certain post-closing working capital and other adjustments, and 711,551 restricted shares of our common stock, which will become unrestricted beginning January 2, 2018 (unless agreed otherwise in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement). Legacy Agriphar was a European crop protection group supported by a team of researchers and regulatory experts which provided a wide range of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides with end markets primarily across Europe. 

2013 Activity 

MacDermid Acquisition &#32;- On October 31, 2013, we completed the MacDermid Acquisition for a total consideration of approximately $1.80 billion &#32;(including the assumption of $754 million &#32;of indebtedness, consisting primarily of MacDermid&#8217;s then existing first lien credit facility), plus (i) up to $100 million of contingent consideration tied to achieving certain EBITDA and stock trading price performance metrics over a seven-year period following the closing of the MacDermid Acquisition, and (ii) an interest in certain MacDermid pending litigations, which consideration was paid through a combination of both equity interests and cash. 

Business Segments 

We generate revenue through the formulation and sale of our dynamic chemistry solutions. In addition, our personnel follow-up with our customers on a regular basis to ensure that the intricate chemical composition and function of our products are maintained as intended and that these products are applied safely and effectively. For example, a customer in our Performance Solutions segment will engage us to manufacture and sell a product consisting of a process composed of eight successive chemical baths, each of which is made up of our specialty chemicals, in order to enhance the overall performance of that customer's circuit boards. A member of our professional service team may then visit that customer&#8217;s sites on a regular basis to ensure that the process sold maintains the correct chemical balance and can be used effectively in the manner and for the purpose desired. Another example from our Agricultural Solutions segment is our &#8220; Aplique Bem &#8221; stewardship program which focuses on teaching growers to apply agrochemicals safely and cost-efficiently. This program started in Brazil in partnership with the Institute of Agriculture, Campinas (IC) and rapidly expanded into Latin America, Africa and Asia. This high quality customer service is also complemented by a close proximity to our global customers' local sites, enabling access to key growth markets. For example, we have developed state-of-the-art facilities in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil and Suzhou, China. 

In addition, we leverage our close customer relationships to execute our growth strategy by working directly with our customers to identify opportunities for new products. These new products are developed and created by drawing upon our significant intellectual property portfolio and technical expertise. We also have strong collaborative relationships with OEMs who specify to us which specialty materials, chemistries and technologies they need in their products. We leverage these relationships to increase OEM qualification of our products. We believe that our customers place significant value on our brands, which we capitalize on through innovation, product leadership and customer service. 

During the first quarter of 2015, we completed certain changes to our organizational structure that resulted in a change to our reportable business segments. As a result, the Performance Materials and Graphic Solutions reportable segments were combined into the Performance Applications reportable segment, and the AgroSolutions reportable segment was re-branded to Agricultural Solutions. In December 2015, the Company further re-branded its Performance Applications segment by changing its name to "Performance Solutions." Platform's segment reporting structure represents businesses for which separate financial information is utilized by our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Each reportable segment has its own president, who reports to the CODM. 

As a result of these organizational and branding changes, Platform manages its business in two &#32;&#32;reportable segments: Performance Solutions and Agricultural Solutions. 

Performance Solutions 

Overview 

Our Performance Solutions segment formulates and markets dynamic chemistry solutions that are used in electronics, automotive production, oil and gas production, drilling, commercial packaging and printing. Our products include surface and coating materials, functional conversion coatings, electronic assembly materials, water-based hydraulic control fluids and photopolymers. In conjunction with the sale of its products, extensive technical service and support is provided to ensure superior performance. The regional sales mix in this segment has shifted over the past several years from more industrialized nations towards emerging markets, such as Asia and South America. Our Performance Solutions segment employs approximately 4,800 &#32;personnel which operate mainly in the Americas, Asia/Pacific region and Europe. 

Our Performance Solutions segment provides specialty chemicals to five industries: 

Electronics. &#32;&#32;We are a global supplier of chemical compounds to the printed circuit board fabrication industry. In this industry, we design and formulate a complete line of proprietary &#8220;wet&#8221; dynamic chemistries that our customers use to process the surface of the printed circuit boards and other electronic components they manufacture. Our product portfolio in this industry is focused on niches such as final finishes, through hole metalization and circuit formation, in which we are a small cost to the overall finished product, but a critical component for maintaining the product&#8217;s performance. We believe our growth in this industry will be driven by demand in telecommunication, wireless devices and computers, and the increasing use of electronics in automobiles. Our customer base includes customers in the following end markets: audio visual; automotive; computers; office equipment; telecommunications; and wireless devices. 

Electronics Assembly Materials . We are a global leader and large supplier of solder and solder pastes for electronics assembly. We develop, manufacture and sell innovative interconnect materials, primarily in the electronics market, used to assemble printed circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packaging. Within this business, we also offer a small water treatment product line, 

Fernox , used for the treatment of water in residential boiler systems, and metal reclaim products, primarily for tin used in electronic assembly. 

Industrial. &#32;&#32;We are a global supplier of dynamic chemistries to the industrial metal and plastic finishing industries. In this industry, our dynamic chemistries are used for finishing, cleaning and providing surface coatings for a broad range of metal and non-metal surfaces. These coatings may have functional uses, including improving wear and tear, such as hard chrome plating of shock absorbers for cars and special rotors used for oil and gas exploration, or providing corrosion resistance for appliance parts, or decorative uses, such as gloss finishes to components used in automotive interiors. Our chemical compounds are manufactured for these surface coating applications, including cleaning, activating, polishing, electro and electroless plating, phosphatizing, stripping and coating, anti-tarnishing and rust inhibiting for metal and plastic surfaces. Electroless plating is a method of plating metals onto a variety of base materials using chemical reduction without the application of electrical power. Electro plating, in contrast, involves plating metals with the use of an electrical current. Phosphatizing is the application of phosphates, such as iron and zinc, to prevent corrosion of steel surfaces. Our industrial customer base is highly fragmented and includes customers in the following end markets: appliances and electronics equipment; automotive parts; industrial parts; plumbing goods; and transportation equipment. We believe our growth in this industry will be primarily driven by increased worldwide automobile production with elevated fashion elements and content per vehicle. The combination of MacDermid, Alent and OM is also expected to not only immediately expand our product offerings, geographic footprint and market share position but also to enhance our innovative capability as a technology-driven business serving as a catalyst to drive specification change and to capitalize on adjacent market opportunities in our industry. 

Offshore. &#32;We produce water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil and gas companies and drilling contractors for offshore deep water production and drilling applications. Production fluids are used in the control systems that open and close critical valves for the deep water oil extraction and transportation process. Drilling fluids are used in control systems to operate valves on the ocean floor. Our current customer base is primarily in the production area of this business, as opposed to drilling and exploration. Although the recent sharp decline in oil prices has slowed the short-term growth expectations of the oil and gas industry, we believe there is significant long-term growth potential for this business as the industry stabilizes, and as oil is produced from new offshore, sub-sea wells. 

Commercial Packaging &#38; Printing . We produce photopolymers through an extensive line of flexographic plates, used to produce printing plates for transferring images onto commercial packaging, including packaging for consumer food products, pet food bags, corrugated boxes, labels and beverage containers. In addition, we produce photopolymer printing plates for the flexographic and letterpress newspaper and publications markets. Our products are used to improve print quality and printing productivity. Flexography is a printing process that utilizes flexible printing plates made of rubber or other flexible plastics. Photopolymers are molecules that change properties upon exposure to light.

Agricultural Solutions 

Overview 

Our Agricultural Solutions segment is based on a solutions-oriented business model that focuses on product innovation to address an ever-increasing need for higher crop yield and quality. We offer to growers diverse crop protection solutions from weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides) and diseases (fungicides), in foliar and seed treatment applications. We also offer a wide variety of proven biosolutions, including biostimulants, which stimulate plant growth and reproductive development, innovative nutrition, which optimizes the nutrition of plants, and biocontrol products, such as bioinsecticides and biofungicides, which perform the same task as conventional crop protection products without chemical residues. We emphasize farmer economics and food safety by combining, when possible, biosolutions with crop protection and seed treatment &#32; agrochemicals. 

In our Agricultural Solutions segment, we have selected key, strategic products to be managed globally. Our global portfolio includes our Global Value Added Portfolio, or GVAP, and our Global BioSolutions Portfolio, or GBP. Our GVAP consists of agrochemicals in the herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and seed treatment categories, based on patented or proprietary off-patent AIs, including products derived from AIs for which we have a strong market position due to differentiated product offerings or supply relationships. Our GBP includes biostimulants, innovative nutrition and biocontrol products. We consider our GVAP and GBP to be key pillars for our sustainable growth. 

We manage our global portfolio in five global functional categories: fungicides and biofungicides; herbicides; insecticides, bioinsecticides and acaricides; biostimulants and innovative nutrition; and seed treatments. Our product offering also includes regional off-patent AIs that complement our global portfolio. Our products are developed for use on high-value target crops such as fruits and vegetables, in addition to key row crops such as soybeans, wheat, canola and corn. Our dedicated sales force works with growers and distributors to promote the use of our products throughout a crop&#8217;s growth cycle and to address selective regional, climate and growth opportunities. We remain focused on expanding our presence in worldwide targeted markets by developing or acquiring crop protection products and obtaining registrations for new products, new uses for existing products and uses of existing products in new countries. Our Agricultural Solutions segment employs approximately 3,700 &#32;personnel with a significant presence in high-growth regions such as Africa and the Middle East, South Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 

Products 

Our Agricultural Solutions segment offers a wide variety of proven crop solutions to growers comprising five major global product lines: fungicides and biofungicides; herbicides; insecticides, bioinsecticides and acaricides; biostimulants and innovative nutrition; and seed treatments: 

Fungicides and Biofungicides: 

&#160; 

Fungicides are products that prevent the spread of fungi and other diseases in crops. Biofungicides, perform the same task as conventional fungicides, without chemical residues. Our fungicides and biofungicides products include Evito , Fortix , Proplant and Vacciplant . 

Herbicides: 

&#160; 

Herbicides are products used to control unwanted plants while leaving the crops they are targeted to grow unharmed. We produce total and selective herbicides with a variety of formulations for many temperate and tropical crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, soybeans and onions. Our main herbicide products are Dinamic , Everest , Pantera and Select . 

Insecticides, Bioinsecticides and Acaricides: 

&#160; 

Our insecticides, such as Cythrin Max , Orthene and Talisma , are products used against insect pests at different stages of the pest life cycle from egg and larvae to nymph and adult. Orthene , for example, is extremely effective in the control of helicoverpa. These products can have both crop and public health applications. Bioinsecticides, such as Carpovirosine, perform the same task as conventional insecticides, without chemical residues. Acaricides or miticides are products that control a variety of mite pests on crops. The products are primarily targeted at tree fruit and nut, vine, ornamental and selected row crop applications for effective mite control programs. Our main miticide products, such as Acramite , Floramite and Omite , are sold globally. 

Biostimulants and Innovative Nutrition: 

&#160;

Seed Treatments: 

&#160; 

We have a leading position in the high-growth and high-value seed treatment industry. Seed treatment products are applied to seed before planting. Our diverse portfolio encompasses pioneer products, such as Rancona and Vitavax . Our seed treatments are used to coat seeds in order to protect the seed during germination and protect the plant during its initial growth phases. We anticipate growth in seed treatments resulting from the expanded use of higher-value genetically-modified seeds. 

In addition, we offer certain non-crop products, including animal health products, such as honey bee protective miticides and certain veterinary vaccines. Apivar, a global miticide for the protection of bees against the Varroa mite, is one of our main honey bee health products. 

Seasonality 

The agrochemical business is seasonal in nature and corresponds to agricultural cycles within each region in which we operate. The geographic spread of our products can result in significant variations in earnings and cash flow during such cycles. Agrochemical and biosolutions sales typically begin ahead of the growing season and peak in the middle of the season. In the northern hemisphere, farmers purchase the majority of their agrochemical inputs during the first half of the year. Growers in the southern hemisphere purchase the majority of their products in the second half of the year. As a result, we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in quarterly sales. For example, due to the size of our market in Latin America, we typically generate greater net sales in the second half of the calendar year and our net sales tend to be lower during the first half of each calendar year. 

Weather conditions and natural disasters such as heavy rains, hurricanes, hail, floods, tornadoes, freezing conditions, drought, or fire also affect decisions by our customers and end-users about the types and amounts of agrochemical and biosolutions products to purchase and the timing of use of such products. For example, an early spring in Europe can bring forward sales from the second quarter into the first quarter. The high degree of correlation between sales patterns and unpredictable weather conditions makes drawing conclusions from quarterly sales difficult. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our ongoing success: 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Asset-Lite, High-Touch&#8221; Business Model. &#32;We are building our business through the acquisition and integration of &#8220;Asset-Lite, High-Touch&#8221; businesses. These are businesses evidenced by high margins and low capital expenditures which translates into high cash flow returns on capital. Over 40% &#32;of our employees are in either technological innovation or sales and services areas; hence &#8220;high-touch.&#8221; Our commitment to technological innovation and our extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop our cutting-edge products. In order to continue to provide innovative products and highly specialized technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining an expert and qualified employee base. Our business involves the formulation of a broad range of specialty chemicals, created by blending raw materials through multi-step technological processes. This model allows us to manage conservatively our growth investments in fixed assets and capital expenditures. Our existing fixed asset base is modern and well-maintained and, accordingly, requires low capital expenditures for maintenance. 

&#8226; 

Industry Leading Positions . &#32;&#32;Our businesses strategically focus on acquiring and maintaining leading positions in niche sectors of high-growth markets by offering high value-added services that are indispensable to our customers. We believe our scale and global reach in product development and marketing provides us with advantages over many of our competitors, allowing us to maintain strong market share positions and drive profitable growth. Our leadership positions contribute to our ability to attract new customers and enter new end-markets . 

&#8226; 

Broad Diversified Business . &#32;We offer a broad range of products and services to diverse and often unrelated end-markets, ranging from agricultural, electronics, industrial and offshore to packaging and printing. Our key proprietary technology, service-oriented business model, high barriers to entry and significant customer switching costs have allowed us to achieve stable and compelling margins while protecting our market share. We believe the diversity of the niche end-markets we serve will enable us to continue our growth and maintain strong cash flow generation throughout economic cycles. The diversification will also help mitigate the impact of a downturn in any single industry, end-market or region. 

&#8226; 

Strong Expertise in Registration and Distribution . Product registration is complex and crucial, particularly in the agrochemical space. Our Agricultural Solutions segment has a team of specialists dedicated to that process across various jurisdictions, and we believe we are well experienced in obtaining the required registrations for our products in each country in which they are sold and for each crop on which they are applied. Once obtained, these registrations provide a right to use the AI upon which the product is based for the specified crop in that country or region for a number of years. In addition, our Agricultural Solutions segment has a strong network of distributors, which currently reaches over 100 countries and jurisdictions. Our large distribution network enables us to focus on profitable niche applications, which we believe are less sensitive to competitive pricing pressures. This distribution network, together with our geographical footprint, also allows us to attract licensing and resale opportunities from partner companies for new products and technologies. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Product Offering . We provide our customers in the electronics, automotive, industrial, packaging, offshore and agricultural chemicals end markets with a comprehensive offering of products that meet many of their specialty chemical needs. In many cases we offer a full suite of products with complementary capabilities that provide a complete functional solution to the customer. We believe the ability to provide a &#8220;top-to-bottom&#8221; product offering is a significant competitive advantage over many of our smaller and regional competitors. Our existing product offerings also offer many opportunities for growth in adjacent end-markets. 

&#8226; 

Performance-Driven Culture and Board with Proven Track Record . We believe we have outstanding people who can deliver superior performance under the tutelage and oversight of proven and experienced leadership. Our culture is performance focused and driven by empowering team members and then holding them accountable for their outcomes. We measure people on financial results, safety, customer satisfaction and commitments, legal compliance and environmental stewardship. We measure our performance against benchmarks and metrics using statistical analysis and drive operational excellence through continuous improvement. Our experienced management team is complimented by an experienced Board, which includes individuals with a proven track record of successfully acquiring and managing businesses. Our business segments are also led by executives that we believe have extensive experience in their respective fields. 

Business Strategies 

Our primary goal is to create value by driving cash flow per share through profitable revenue growth while continuing to manage our costs. We will develop and engineer new products and processes, leverage our global scale to enter new markets and optimally manage our existing portfolio of specialty chemical businesses. Our efforts are directed by the following key business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Build a Best-in-Class Specialty Chemical Company. Our goal is to build an integrated best-in-class, global manufacturer, marketer and distributor of specialty chemical products. We anticipate that the fragmented nature of the specialty chemical products market will continue to provide opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. We believe that our combined company provides a strong platform on which to grow our business and expand our market shares in key geographic markets, particularly in emerging markets. 

&#8226;

We have a diverse customer base, as we sell our products either directly to end-user customers or through intermediaries, such as independent, third-party distributors (national, regional, or local), agricultural cooperatives, retailers, and government agencies. We also have collaborative relationships with many OEMs, who specify to us which specialty materials, chemistries and technologies are used in their products, and then sell their products to their own suppliers. The majority of our sales are through such intermediaries. &#160; A number of customers of our Performance Solutions segment manufacture products for cyclical industries, including electronics and automotive industries. As a result, demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical. 

Within each segment, we rely on independent distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. We believe that we are able to attract new customers successfully through our international reach, coupled with our local presence, which enables us to meet the global and local needs of our customers through a global network of 62 &#32;manufacturing sites, 13 &#32;of which include research centers, &#32; 15 &#32;stand-alone research centers, and a direct sales force in over 60 &#32;countries. Our flexible manufacturing base allows for "just in time" supply chain management. We operate a relatively large number of small and medium-sized facilities located close to our customers throughout the world's major economic regions. This close proximity to our global customers' local sites enables access to all key growth markets. 

We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Although no customer or distributor constitutes 10% or more of our consolidated net sales, we do have customers and distributors, the loss of which may impair our results of operations for the affected earnings periods. 

Selling &#38; Marketing 

Proprietary sales are generated from chemical compounds formulated from our own research and development laboratories and facilities. In many cases, these products are protected with patents, trade secrets or trademarks. Proprietary products have higher gross margins than non-proprietary products, and are perceived by our management to be more critical to our overall performance. 

We employ a large customer-centric sales and marketing force of professionals worldwide. These professionals have strong technical expertise, local market knowledge and intimate customer relationships. Our local sales and marketing teams closely monitor local market trends and maintain active dialogue with our customers to assess and understand their constantly evolving challenges. We use this feedback from our local sales teams to anticipate future needs, respond rapidly to changing market conditions, and deliver customized, value-added solutions for our customers. This feedback loop is an important source of new product ideas and helps guide our capital allocation decisions. We leverage local market intelligence to develop new and innovative products that are then marketed by our local sales and marketing teams throughout the markets we serve. 

Performance Solutions 

In our Performance Solutions segment, methods for selling and marketing our proprietary products vary slightly by geographic region. In total, we generate business through the efforts of sales and service personnel and regional distributors. In the Americas, we employ sales, administrative and service personnel to market our entire line of proprietary products. In certain areas of the Americas, distributors also sell and service many of our products. We also market our products through subsidiaries in Brazil, Canada and Mexico. In Europe, sales, administrative and service representatives, who are employed by our subsidiaries located in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey, market our proprietary products. In the Asia-Pacific region, our local subsidiaries employ sales, administrative and service representatives to market our proprietary products through either subsidiaries or branches in Australia, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. In addition to the countries where we have wholly owned subsidiaries, some of our proprietary chemistries are sold in other countries throughout Asia, Europe and South America through distributors. 

Agricultural Solutions 

In our Agricultural Solutions segment, our products are sold in over 100 countries globally and reach our grower-customers and the ultimate end-users through a wide variety of market channels. Our sales, marketing, and go-to-market strategies vary significantly by region and depend to a large extent on the existing distribution infrastructure and market practices in each particular country. Depending upon the customer&#8217;s location, we work with national and regional distributors, retailers, co-ops, government entities, and growers to promote our solutions. We also have loyalty programs in place for distributors and engage in active grower education to promote our products and brands. Because of our global presence and local capabilities, other agrochemical and crop protection companies enter into exclusive distribution rights agreements with us. Such agreements give us the exclusive right to distribute their products in, or with respect to, specified territories, crops, applications, channels, and formulations. 

In the larger and more mature North American market, we rely more heavily on an extensive existing distribution network. The North American distributor landscape is one of the most consolidated. In Asia, Europe and Latin America, sales and marketing are conducted through a mix of national and regional distributors, retailers, co-ops, and growers (primarily large farmers). 

Africa and Middle East represent our most unique region from a sales and marketing perspective due to relatively lower levels of existing distribution infrastructure. In many cases, growers in this region require additional customer outreach and education as our products and the agronomic techniques to apply them are relatively new to this market. In order to address these challenges, we have developed an extensive regional distribution network to enable us to efficiently deliver our products and products of our distribution partners to the growers. 

Employees 

In order to ensure that we are able to continue to provide innovative products and highly technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining a highly specialized and qualified employee base. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 8,200 &#32;full-time employees across over 67 &#32;countries, including approximately 3,600 &#32;research and development chemists and experienced technical service and sales personnel. &#160; 

In addition, many of our full-time employees are employed outside the United States. In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils as required by law. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and/or works councils. 

Our management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory. 

Research and Development 

Continued investment in research and development ensures that we remain ahead of emerging trends, delivering solutions to strengthen our leadership positions in terms of innovation and product development in our market niches. Our research and development activities are also focused on developing products and improving formulations and processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations. We accelerate market introductions and increase the impact of our product offerings through collaboration with partners in the commercial sector (customers and value chain partners) and by working with distributors, OEMs, governments and local communities around the world. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 

Performance Solutions 

With respect to our Performance Solutions segment, research in connection with proprietary products is performed principally in Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan and the United States. During 2015, the segment's research and development expenses totaled $25.4 million . Substantially all research and development activity was performed internally. Alent, which we acquired on December 1, 2015, recorded historical research and development expenditures of $25.4 million &#32;for the 2015 pre-acquisition period. The OMG Businesses, which we acquired on October 28, 2015, recorded historical research and development expenditures of $5.2 million &#32;for the 2015 pre-acquisition period. 

Agricultural Solutions 

Within our Agricultural Solutions segment, our global and regional marketing teams conduct a rigorous process for identifying key AIs with proven technical efficacy, which can be brought to market through our formulation, marketing, and distribution capabilities, in order to address strategic gaps in our portfolio. During 2015, the segment's research and development expenses totaled $37.4 million . Arysta, which we acquired on February 13, 2015, recorded research and development expenditures of $3.5 million &#32;for the 2015 pre-acquisition period. 

Competitive Environment 

Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject to rapid changes in technology. Broadly speaking, we compete in the specialty chemicals market. On a more narrow scale, we compete in markets for specialty chemicals for agrochemicals, electronic applications, general metal and plastic finishing, oil and gas exploration and production, and printing. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to promoting and selling certain products. Some large competitors operate globally, as we do, but most operate only locally or regionally. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete. 

The competitive environments for each segment are described below: 

Performance Solutions 

Our Performance Solutions segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly compete within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc. (a division of Total S.A.), The Dow Chemical Company, across its industrial and electronics chemicals businesses, as well as Asahi, Senju, Tamura, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and Flint Group. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products and services, and service and support. We maintain extensive support, technical and testing services for our customers, and are continuously developing new products. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as the merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and The Dow Chemical Company, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. However, we believe that our combined abilities to manufacture, sell, service and develop new products and applications, enable us to compete successfully both locally and internationally. 

Agricultural Solutions 

The agrochemical sector is a highly developed and competitive industry with a wide range of established competitors that offer a broad variety of competing products. Our main competitors include major multinational agrochemical companies which engage in basic research for AI discovery, such as BASF, Bayer CropScience Pty Ltd and Syngenta AG, as well as a number of Japanese participants. We also face competition from a variety of off-patent agrochemical companies worldwide, including FMC Corporation, ADAMA Agricultural Solutions Ltd., United Phosphorus Ltd., and Nufarm Limited, among others. 

The biosolutions sector is a newer and less mature industry than agrochemicals. There is significantly less direct competition among providers given the highly differentiated, proprietary nature of biosolutions products. However, we do compete with biosolutions providers that have similar product claims and offer potential functional substitutes for our products. Customer education and corresponding demand creation is a critical element of competing in the biosolutions sector. Customer acceptance and adoption levels may vary widely. It is a very fragmented market, with the participation of companies that do not necessarily compete in the agrochemical space. Our current competitors include Stoller S.A., Novozymes Biopharma A/S, Verdesian LifeSciences, LLC, Bayer CropScience Pty Ltd (AgraQuest, Inc.), Valagro SpA, BASF SE (Becker Underwood Inc.), Plant Health Care plc and various others. 

Product Backlog 

Due to the relatively short cycle times in our business, our product backlog levels are minimal. In general, we do not formulate our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

Raw Materials and Sourcing of Products 

In our Performance Solutions segment, we use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials on an as-needed basis from outside sources. 

In our Agricultural Solutions segment, we rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components or products. There is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements. With one minor exception, we engage in no direct agrochemical AI manufacturing. We source virtually all of our AIs from third-party manufacturers, which represent a limited number of key suppliers for AIs. We strive to maintain multiple supply sources for each AI; however, in limited instances, there is only a single registered source of AIs for certain important products where there is currently no viable alternative source. Our goal is to maximize our sourcing of raw materials, especially AIs, from quality suppliers in countries with generally low manufacturing costs, such as China, eastern Europe and India. 

We formulate and package our products in-house or through tolling and other third-party manufacturing and formulation arrangements. We balance our in-house formulation with third-party arrangements to limit our exposure to utilization drop-offs, facility closures, and certain manufacturing-related environmental risks which helps us to optimize our cost position. 

Within certain portions of our biosolutions portfolio, we manage an end-to-end supply chain. We purchase natural raw materials, such as plant extracts and seaweed, to extract AIs for our biosolutions products. 

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Products 

Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are important to our business and are protected by a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, data exclusivity, and other marketing exclusivity rights, exclusive or semi-exclusive manufacturing arrangements, and other non-patent strategies. We seek intellectual property and other proprietary rights in major markets and other commercially-relevant jurisdictions worldwide. We implement confidentiality procedures and contractual exclusivity and seek other rights necessary to protect our intellectual property, proprietary formulations, processes, and other product-related rights. We rely on trade secrets and know-how confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, natural product composition/origin, and formulations. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements, when applicable, with our employees, consultants, contractors, and other third-parties who may be engaged in discovery or development of intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Finally, we seek to include provisions in our material transfer agreements, license and development agreements, and other agreements that provide for the transfer of intellectual property rights back to us to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of any specific transaction and development project. 

Performance Solutions 

In our Performance Solutions segment, as of December 31, 2015, we owned or licensed the rights to more than 2,300 domestic and foreign patents. The patents we hold are important to our business and have remaining lives of varying duration. Although certain of these patents are becoming increasingly more important, we believe that our ability to provide technical and testing services to our customers and meet their rapid delivery requirements is equally, if not, more important to our business. No specific group or groups of intellectual property rights are material to our business. However, we have many proprietary products which are not covered by patents and which are responsible for a large component of our total sales. Further, we hold a number of domestic and foreign trade names and trademark registrations and applications for registration, which we consider to be of value in identifying our products. We do not hold nor have we granted any franchises or concessions. 

Agricultural Solutions 

In our Agricultural Solutions segment, as of December 31, 2015, we owned, licensed or had freedom-to-operate rights under, approximately 300 &#32;domestic and foreign patents, and over 7,000 product registrations. As part of our intellectual property strategy, we in-license patents from other agrochemical and biosolutions companies and we pursue other patents not related to composition of matter, such as use extensions, formulations, mixtures and manufacturing processes. We also differentiate our AIs with value-added mixtures and novel formulations, with launches prior to the expiration of the AIs' patent protection, in order to avoid a potential price erosion and loss of share. A significant portion of our patent portfolio consists of patents relating to amicarbazone , flucarbazone &#32;and fluoxastrobin , three of our key GVAP AIs. Our patents covering manufacturing processes, methods of use, and combinations with other AIs, safeners, or other adjuvants of these three GVAP AIs are scheduled to expire in commercially relevant markets at various times before the end of 2020 for amicarbazone; 2022 for flucarbazone; and 2024 for fluoxastrobin . With respect to fluoxastrobin , we have a pending application in the United States covering a manufacturing process which we intend 

to file in other countries as well, which, if granted, will expire no sooner than 2036. We believe this new process will contribute to lower costs for the manufacture of fluoxastrobin , which would represent a significant competitive advantage over potential generic entrants. 

Other property rights protection 

Some products that have already lost patent protection but have originally been registered by a company are often referred to as proprietary off-patent products, especially if the company holds a significant share of the AI. These are often characterized by a substantial degree of differentiation through formulation and product package offerings responsive to grower needs. Proprietary off-patent products enable providers to maintain a stronger market position and a differentiated margin profile, which may be further enhanced by specialized market access, a strong brand, or a competitive cost position. In addition, while they are not protected by patents, proprietary off-patent products require registrations in every country for every crop and AI that will be sold. Our strong registration capabilities provide us with the ability to effectively maintain and defend our existing registrations as well as to acquire new registrations in a cost effective and timely manner. 

Proprietary off-patent products can benefit from other barriers to entry, designed to reward the company which first registers an AI in a certain geography, following significant investments in regulatory data to support that initial registration, with an exclusive period of sales (&#8220;exclusive use&#8221;) and, after the exclusive use period has expired, an additional period of financial compensation from other companies which request access to the data developed by the original company (&#8220;data compensation&#8221;) to obtain a registration of that same AI in that geography. These barriers to entry are established in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, the EU and the United States. 

Our global portfolio is composed of multiple proprietary off-patent products including: acephate ; &#32;amitraz ; &#32;ipconazole ; &#32;diflubenzuron ; bifenazate ; &#32;clethodim ; &#32; and propargite &#32;and cypermethrin for the EU. Many of our proprietary off-patent AIs are currently benefiting from exclusive use and data compensation provisions. 

Government and Environmental Regulation 

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including tax and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business. However, no portion of our business is subject to re-negotiation of profits or termination of material contracts or subcontracts at the election of the governments in the countries in which we operate. 

We are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. Our reliance on independent distributors to sell some of our proprietary chemicals internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents, and we could be held responsible for their actions. Other U.S. companies have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with these individuals. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Bribery Act, which went into effect in the third quarter of 2011, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. In recent years, several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures. 

We maintain a Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, applicable to all our directors and employees. In addition, our CEO, CFO and CAO are bound by the provisions of a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. These Policy and Code of Ethics were both approved by our Board and cover compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, as well as other legal areas applicable to our operations. The Business Conduct and Ethics Policy establishes a duty to report non-compliance and provides avenues for making such reports, including a reporting hotline. The Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers provides for additional specific policies for our senior financial officers, including the duty to conduct themselves with the highest degree of honesty and ethics when acting on behalf of the Company. We also maintain a system for auditing compliance with applicable laws. 

As a manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals and systems, we are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants 

into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated properties and occupational safety and health matters. We have and may in the future incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines and sanctions and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage or personal injuries as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2015 , we believe we had appropriate reserves for our various environmental matters. 

Domestic and international laws regulate the production and marketing of chemical substances. Almost every country has its own legal procedures for registration, transportation, export and import. Of these, the laws and regulations in Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States are the most significant, in particular to our Agricultural Solutions segment. The European Union Commission for example has established procedures whereby all existing crop protection active ingredient chemicals commercially available in the EU are to be reviewed. REACH, adopted in December 2006, requires manufacturers and importers of most chemicals in the EU to register these chemicals and evaluate their potential impact on human health and the environment. The effective date of the legislation was June 1, 2007 and it required all covered substances to be pre-registered by November 30, 2008. Since December 1, 2008, no product containing covered substances can be manufactured in or imported into the EU unless the substances therein have been pre-registered. Active substances and co-formulants used in plant protection products (pesticides) are generally exempt from REACH as they are considered as already registered under the Plant Protection Products Directive 91/414/EEC. However, there are certain exceptions that may apply that require the active substance or co-formulant to be registered under REACH, particularly if the substance has a non-plant protection use. While we have registered and continue to register substances as necessary in accordance with applicable registration review deadlines, the registration process is lengthy and registration of certain of our substances may not be immediately effective. The cost estimates could vary based on the number of substances requiring registration, data availability and cost. The implementation of the REACH registration process may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products in the future. Additionally, other laws and regulations regulate and may limit our business in other countries. We incur, and will incur, substantial costs to register and maintain the registrations of our products in the jurisdictions in which we do business. 

In response to increased government attention to environmental matters worldwide, we continue to develop proprietary products designed to reduce the discharge of pollutant materials into the environment and eliminate the use of certain targeted raw materials while enhancing the efficiency of customer chemical processes. 

In addition, many of our full-time employees are employed outside the United States. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, particularly Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, labor and employment laws are relatively stringent and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to certain employees, including rights on termination of employment. In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils as required by law. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and/or works councils. These laws, coupled with the requirement to consult with the relevant unions or works councils, could adversely affect our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes and could limit our ability to access the skilled employees on which our business depends.
