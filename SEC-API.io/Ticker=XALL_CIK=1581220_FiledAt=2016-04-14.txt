 Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160;

Corporate Background 

&#160;

We are an emerging growth company (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act), and were formed in the State of Nevada on December 14, 2009.

&#160;

We are building a business development company specialized in the payment industry and financial technology (&#147;Fintech&#148;). 

Xalles supports government and business organizations with payment consulting and system solutions. Xalles supports its own investee companies with the same strategic services plus direct investment and marketing and communications services. 

Xalles has created a financial, technological and resource backbone to support the investee companies and external client projects. This backbone consists of senior payment solutions consultants and a proprietary system for the financial reconciliation and auditing of business and government payment transactions. Xalles also has a license to a patented payment card security solution.

Xalles, through its 3 core services, provides the company with high growth opportunities with assets on the balance sheet combined with recurring revenue streams for progressive income.

For targeted investments, Xalles has selected companies that have anchor customers, the right plan to capture the emerging target market, an exit strategy, and can leverage Xalles&#146; IP and payments systems expertise to add value and accelerate the rollout of their products and services.

Xalles forms a partnership with the investee companies, and while meeting their needs, also shares in their success.

Our Business 

&#160;

As discussed in the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we had no revenue and had a net loss of approximately $156,450. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern, and our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding this uncertainty in their report on our financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating cash flow sufficient to fund operations. Our business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.

&#160;

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

During 2016, we will continue to complete the closing of transactions that were initiated in July 2015 through the reverse merger agreement. These transactions include ArrowVista Corporation and Xalles Singapore Pte Ltd. becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Xalles Holdings Inc. during the first half of 2016. These 2 corporate entities would join Xalles Limited in becoming the first 3 wholly owned subsidiaries. Xalles Limited is the consulting and technology arm of Xalles, ArrowVista is primarily providing payment audit services, and Xalles Singapore holds shares in international holdings, currently its stake in Proxima Financeira S.A., a Brazilian corporation. During 2016, Co-Owners Rewards Inc. will become a partially owned subsidiary of Xalles Holdings.

We will continue fundraising efforts in 2016 and have target projects and companies to invest new funds in that will be synergistic with our existing portfolio of services. The synergy involves new sources of revenue and market penetration into new market segments such as prepaid cards in the U.S. and Brazil, eProcurement, eCommerce and B2B payment systems.

We will continue to seek acquisitions for our target business areas within Fintech. Specific areas of interest are government and business payment solutions, as well as consumer payment and rewards products and services.

We plan to expand our strategic partnerships beyond our existing business development and audit service relationships.

We expect during 2016 to add management staff including a Chief Revenue Officer and a Chief Financial Officer.

Our goals for 2016 are to expand Xalles revenue through expanded consulting and audit client engagements with government and business prospects, as well as expand the asset footprint through strategic acquisitions which will yield asset growth as well as recurring revenue.

&#160; 

Market Sizes 

Below are some of the relevant marketplaces we intend to compete in and their market sizing data.

U.S. Prepaid Card Market 

In 2014, retail purchases made with prepaid cards will top U.S. $200 billion dollars, equaling five percent of all retail spending in the U.S. The purchase volume numbers include prepaid debit, payroll cards, open and closed-loop gift cards, and open and closed-loop consumer incentive cards.

Brazil Prepaid/Debit Card Market 

The debit card market in Brazil, currently valued at around BRL 250 billion, is expected to double in size by 2016. Debit cards have seen 25% annual growth rate over the past 5 years, as consumers have found this payment method easy to adopt, while debit card providers have marketed the security and convenience of their use.

Electronic Payments Market 

The estimated number of noncash payments, excluding wire transfers, was 122.8 billion in 2012, with a value of $79.0 trillion. The number of noncash payments in the United States increased at a compound annual rate of 4.4 percent from 2009.

B2B eProcurement and eCommerce Market 

According to recent research from Frost &#38; Sullivan, Alibaba is a pioneer of B2B eCommerce with gross merchandise value of $27.28 billion, about 11 percent of their total; this dominant leadership position in a market expected to grow to $6.7 trillion in gross merchandise value by 2020. This trend will make the B2B eCommerce market two times bigger than the B2C market ($3.2 trillion) within that timeframe.

Competition 

We expect to encounter significant competition from others seeking to acquire similar interests in Fintech companies and assets. This includes a likely increase in the number of competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar technologies or companies to those that we may seek to acquire. Most of our competitors have much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial and human resources, than we do. 

The following companies compete with Xalles in one or more domain areas:

Costas Inc. (OTC PINK: CSSI) - Holding company to acquire digital currency and Fintech companies

Perk.com (TSX: PER) - mobile rewards company similar to financial rewards community of Co-Owners

Cass Information Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CASS) - Freight and other B2B payment auditing services

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH) - Business process and IT consulting including logistics and financial services industries 

Towers Watson (NASDAQ: TW) &#150; Financial services consulting

We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for Fintech acquisitions. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do. As we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more marketplaces that we may then rely upon to generate future revenue.

&#160;

Other companies may develop competing technologies services that offer better or less expensive alternatives to our product and service offerings. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do. Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of our services offered by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or uneconomical.

&#160;

Employees and Consultants 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any full time or part time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer works full time on a personal services contract to the company. Other staff are independent contractors available on an as needed basis. We currently engage independent contractors in the areas of accounting, legal, auditing services and corporate development.
