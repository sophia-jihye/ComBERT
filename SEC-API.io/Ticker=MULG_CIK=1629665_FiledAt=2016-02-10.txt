Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&#38;A; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company&#8217;s executive compensation arrangements; and No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;).

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a) (2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected not to use the extended transition period provided above.

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

Our Business 

&#160;

We are a development stage company with limited operation as of the date of this Annual Report, which has been limited to organizational and business development activities. We are an international start-up consulting company that intends to assists start-ups and development stage companies, as well as established companies, with consulting services focused on doing business in the United States and China, providing administrative support and business consulting to the process. Our mission is to assist management in early stage companies with services designed to keep them focused on their core business ideas while provide the proper ways to enter the desired marketplace. We have had limited operations at this time and have limited financial resources. Our auditors indicated in their report on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that our &#8220;lack of business operations and early losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities, which include:

&#160;

1. Formation of the Company; 2. Development of our business plan; 3. Evaluating various target industries to market our services; 4. Research on marketing channels and strategies for our services 5. The development of our initial online website; and 6. Research on services and pricing of our services. 7. Leverage management&#8217;s business contacts to identify potential clients. &#160;

We intend to provide services to target companies with the mission to assist the entrepreneurs develop their product and services to the international marketplace and provide hands-on support services to reduce startup costs and accelerate time to market. Besides general administrative services, we intend to offer services to assist with product development and design on a referral basis once the nature of the business and its needs are identified, corporate formation and structure. We also intend to offer virtual office space, financial and accounting resources on a referral basis, marketing and branding services and legal guidance by collaborating with law firms and accounting firms. These professional referrals will be dealing directly with the client for payment of their offered services. By offering these services, we intend to enable our potential entrepreneurial clients the time to focus on developing their products and services so they are not consumed with administrative activities that will consume valuable time from their work schedules. We believe that the administrative and other consulting services will increase the value of our potential clients businesses thereby increasing the attractiveness for additional capital to enable them to bring their products and services to market. At this time we have no official fee structure; pricing will be based upon job description and the anticipated services required by the client company.

As of the date of this Annual Report, Company is contemplating to consummate an acquisition or merger using its subsidiaries in Muliang and Mufeng. However, there can be no assurance that such transaction will be completed at this point.

&#160;

Target Market 

&#160;

The target market will consist of startup and developmental stage businesses located in the United States and China. We cater our services to startups and developmental stage companies that do not have the resources to execute or implement their business plan or ideas with the personnel in-house. Our client companies can derive value from our support and expertise with dealing with the typical growing pains and common mistakes experienced by startups.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

As we are in the early stage of operation, our management has been responsible for all marketing and sales efforts. The responsibilities include formalizing business arrangements with third party service providers, directing the development of our website and other online communication tools, and formulating marketing materials to be used during presentations and meetings.

&#160;

We plan to enter the market by developing relationships initially with startups and development stage companies. We plan to launch a website to promote our services and provide a contact function that allows potential clients to reach us for additional information. We may also utilize social media such as Facebook, Twitter and an online blog to increase our presence online and communicate the value we can add.

&#160;

We do not have any specific marketing channels in place at this point to market our services to potential customers. We plan to market our services through word of mouth or personal referrals, as referrals from companies that are satisfied with our provided services are likely to be our most significant and efficient form of marketing.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The primary source of competition will come from various service providers such as business plan writers, auditors, lawyers, marketing firms as well as many other types of service providers. In addition those startups and development stage companies that have the resources and inclination to handle these tasks in-house will not need our services . 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;-4- &#160; 

(table of contents) 

There are also numerous established firms that offer some combination of marketing, promotional and general consulting services to startup and development stage companies in the industry. In addition, there are a number of large and well-established general consulting firms that provide strategy and implementation services to the industry as well as a number of other industries. We are a new entry into this competitive market and may struggle to differentiate ourselves as a specialist that provides more value for startup and development stage companies.

&#160;

Services Pricing 

&#160;

The cost for consulting projects will depend on the scope of the project and time required to execute it. We may charge a flat fee based on the services that our clients request from us, an hourly rate, revenue share or a combination of the above in order to provide our clients with as many cost effective options as possible. Additionally, all expenses incurred, including engaging third parties, travel as well as other approved expenses, will be passed through to the client for reimbursements.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We presently have no other employees other than our sole officer and director. We plan to rely exclusively on the services of our sole officer and director to establish business operations and perform or supervise the minimal services required at this time. We believe that our operations are currently on a small scale and manageable. As our business grows, we may hire employees and/or engage additional independent contractors in order to execute our projects. These decisions will be made by our officers if and when appropriate.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our business activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by government agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate businesses. We do not anticipate any regulations specific to our business activities in the future.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

We do not have a seasonal business cycle.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We do not hold any patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property on services or processes relating to our business. With the exception of domain name and mobile app in the future, we do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business.
