Business 

General 

Cisco designs and sells broad lines of products, provides services and delivers integrated solutions to develop and connect networks around the world. For over 30 years, we have helped our customers build networks and automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize information technology (IT)&#8211;based products and services. In an increasingly connected world, Cisco is helping to transform businesses, governments and cities worldwide. Over time, we have expanded to new markets that are a natural extension of our core networking business, as the network has become the platform for delivering an ever-increasing portfolio of IT&#8211;based products and services. &#32; 

We conduct our business globally, and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). For revenue and other information regarding these segments, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Switching; Next-Generation Network (NGN) Routing; Collaboration; Data Center; Wireless; Service Provider Video; Security; and Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Increasingly, we are delivering our technology, and services to our customers as solutions for their priorities including cloud, video, mobility, security, collaboration, and analytics. The network is at the center of these markets and technologies, and we are focused on delivering integrated solutions to help our customers achieve their desired business outcomes. Our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments and service providers. These customers look to us as a strategic partner to help them use IT to enable, differentiate or fundamentally define their business strategy and drive growth, improve productivity, reduce costs, mitigate risk, and gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world. 

We were incorporated in California in December 1984, and our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this report. 

Strategy and Focus Areas 

We see our customers increasingly using technology and, specifically, networks to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and try to gain a competitive advantage. In this increasingly digital world, we believe data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The network also plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data, where there is a premium on security and speed. We believe this is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connects nearly everything that can be digitally connected. 

To deliver on our strategy, we are focused on providing highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects highly distributed data that is globally dispersed across organizations. Together with our ecosystem of partners and developers, we will provide technology, services, and solutions we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale, security and agility. &#32; 

Over the last several years, we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized, how we sell our products, and how we build and deliver our technology. 

We have begun aggressively transitioning our portfolio to enable delivery both on premise and through the cloud in alignment with our strategy to shift to a business model based on more recurring revenue. We plan to expand the approach we have taken with our cloud-networking platforms to an increasing portion of our product and service portfolio to accelerate our shift to a more subscription and software-based model. 

Our approach is to continue to lead the market transitions in our core markets, and enter new markets where the network is foundational. We continue to drive product transitions, including the introduction of next-generation products that offer, in our view, better price-performance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors. 

We also plan to continue to deliver innovation across our portfolio in order to sustain our leadership, and strategic position with customers. We intend to execute on this strategy through portfolio transformation, internal innovation, acquisition of strategic assets, investments in start-up companies, and co-development of products with our customers and the building of strategic partnerships. 

Market Transitions 

We seek to capitalize on market transitions as sources of future opportunities as part of the continued transformation of our business, and we believe market transitions in the IT industry are occurring with greater frequency. Market transitions relating to the network are becoming, in our view, more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a cost center issue&#8212;where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing network-related productivity&#8212;to becoming a platform for revenue generation, business agility, and competitive advantage. Some examples of significant market transitions are as follows: 

Security &#32;&#32;&#32;We believe that security is the top IT priority for many of our customers. In an evolving dynamic threat landscape, the most effective way to address security challenges is with continuous threat protection that is pervasive and integrated. We further believe that security solutions will help to protect the digital economy and will be an enabler that safeguards business interests, protects customers, and creates competitive advantage. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a unified threat-centric security architecture combining network-based, cloud-based and endpoint-based solutions, providing our customers both more effective security outcomes and a secure foundation to digitize their assets. We have invested in security through a build, buy, and partner strategy to provide security across the entire attack continuum before, during, and after a cyber attack. 

Digital Transformation &#32;&#32;&#32; &#32;Countries, cities, industries and businesses are pursuing "digital transformation", which we define as the application of technology to build new business models, processes, software and systems, to capitalize on new digital ways of doing business. Digital transformation is made possible by the convergence of people, businesses and things. We believe these types of transformations create opportunities to deliver better customer experiences, create new revenue streams through business model transformation, and optimize efficiency through workforce innovation. 

As our customers move from traditional to digital businesses, our goal is to be a strategic partner by providing a technology foundation for digital transformation. Our offerings for this opportunity incorporate a portfolio of products and services, outcome-oriented digital solutions, a developer-rich environment and a partner ecosystem that integrate connectivity, security, automation, collaboration and analytics across customers' business value-chains. 

In our view, we are delivering the architectural approach and solution-based results to help customers reduce complexity, accelerate and grow, and manage risk in a world that is increasingly virtualized, application-centric, cloud-based, analytics-driven, and mobile. An example of this is our fiscal 2016 acquisition of Jasper Technologies, Inc. ("Jasper"), the developer of a cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) services platform designed to help enterprises and service providers to launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale. 

Software-Defined Networking &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We are focusing on a market transition involving the move toward more programmable, flexible, and virtual networks, sometimes called software-defined networking (SDN). This transition is focused on providing a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible, application-driven customization of network infrastructures. We believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with hardware, and software elements together to meet customers&#8217; total cost of ownership, quality, security, scalability, and experience requirements. In our view, there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area. 

We believe the opportunity of SDN is to enable more open, and programmable network infrastructure. We are addressing this opportunity with a unique strategy, and set of solutions designed to respond automatically to the needs of our customers' mission critical applications. We introduced and began shipping our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI), which delivers centralized application-driven policy automation, management, and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system. ACI is comprised of our Nexus 9000 portfolio of switches, enhanced versions of our NX-OS operating system, and the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), which provides a central place to configure, automate, and manage an entire network, based on the needs of applications. 

Cloud &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Our cloud strategy is to connect private and public clouds working across hypervisors, which are software programs used to create and manage virtual environments. We utilize OpenStack, which is an open source computing platform, to deliver integrated hybrid-cloud solutions. We believe cloud infrastructures need to be secure, and support a rich ecosystem of network-enabled applications to deliver the data and analytics that support the digitization of our customers' environments. As part of our cloud strategy, we are delivering infrastructure and our cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings including WebEx, Meraki cloud networking, and certain other of our Security and Collaboration offerings. 

We believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique, recognizing that we offer a solution to different cloud environments including private, hybrid, and public clouds that enables them to move their workloads across heterogeneous private and public clouds with the necessary policy, security and management features. 

For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factor entitled &#8220;We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers&#8217; changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.&#8221; For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Products and Services 

Our current offerings fall into several categories: 

Switching 

Switching is an integral networking technology used in campuses, branch offices, and data centers. Switches are used within buildings in local-area networks (LANs), and across great distances in wide-area networks (WANs). Our switching products offer many forms of connectivity to end users, workstations, IP phones, wireless access points, and servers and also function as aggregators on LANs and WANs. Our switching systems employ several widely used technologies, including Ethernet, Power over Ethernet (PoE), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Packet over Synchronous Optical Network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching. Many of our switches are designed to support an integrated set of advanced services, allowing organizations to be more efficient by using one switch for multiple networking functions rather than multiple switches to accomplish the same functions. 

Key product platforms within our Switching product category, in which we also include storage products, are as follows:

Fixed-configuration switches &#32; are designed to cover a range of deployments in both large enterprises as well as in small and medium-sized businesses, providing a foundation for converged data, voice, and video services. Our fixed-configuration switches range from small, standalone switches to stackable models that function as a single, scalable switching unit. 

Modular switches are typically used by enterprise and service provider customers with large-scale network needs. These products are designed to offer customers the flexibility and scalability to deploy numerous, as well as advanced, networking services without degrading overall network performance. 

Fixed-configuration and modular switches also include products such as optics modules, which are shared across multiple product platforms. Our switching portfolio also includes virtual switches and related offerings. These products provide switching functionality for virtual machines, and are designed to operate in a complementary fashion with virtual services to optimize security and application behavior. 

In fiscal 2014, we introduced what we call our application centric infrastructure (ACI) solution, which is part of our Data Center Switching portfolio. Cisco ACI consists of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches, a Cisco APIC and accompanying centralized policy management capability, integrated physical and virtual infrastructure, and an open ecosystem of network, storage, management, and orchestration vendors. During fiscal 2016, we have seen strong adoption of Cisco ACI across geographies and customer segments. 

We plan to integrate new technologies with the Cisco ACI solution. As an example, our CloudCenter platform, a technology obtained through our acquisition of CliQr Technologies, Inc. in fiscal 2016, is an application-defined platform that, together with the Cisco ACI networking solution, provides an infrastructure-agnostic way to streamline the modeling, migration, and management of applications across IT resources. Also, in fiscal 2016 we introduced our Tetration Analytics platform which supplements Cisco ACI offering by delivering real-time visibility across the data center using hardware, and software sensors to provide behavior-based application insight with deep forensic-based analysis. 

During fiscal 2016, we began shipping multi-gigabit-capable technology on Cisco Catalyst 4500-E, 3850 and 3560-CX switches. Cisco Catalyst multigigabit technology can deliver speeds beyond one Gigabit on the customers&#8217;existing Category 5e cable delivery standard, thereby utilizing capabilities in customers&#8217;existing cabling infrastructure to meet their bandwidth requirements. Multi-gigabit technology also enables intermediate data rates of 2.5 and 5 gigabits-per-second (Gbps) to ease the jump between traditional rates of one Gbps and ten Gbps. The technology also supports Cisco&#8217;s power-over-ethernet capabilities known as PoE+, and Cisco Universal PoE (UPOE). PoE is a technology for wired ethernet local area networks (LANs) that allows the electrical current necessary for the operation of each device to be carried by the data cables rather than by power cords, thus minimizing the number of wires that must be installed with the network and thereby lowering cost and downtime and enabling easier maintenance and installation flexibility. 

During fiscal 2016, we saw continued adoption of Cisco&#8217;s Unified Access architecture based on the Unified Access Data Plane ASIC, which was first made available on the Cisco Catalyst 3850 and then added to the Cisco Catalyst 4500-E and the Cisco Catalyst 3650. The Unified Access platform has been adopted across all geographies and customer segments. During fiscal 2016, we continued to see adoption of our previously announced infrastructure initiatives focused on bringing &#8220;network as a sensor&#8221; and &#8220;network as an enforcer&#8221; capabilities across the portfolio. With security as top of mind for many customers, these capabilities provide analytics and control through the network for threat mitigation before, during, and after an attack. 

Our switching products are used by customers in both data center and campus environments. Individually, our switching suite of products is designed to offer the performance and features required for nearly any deployment, from traditional small workgroups, wiring closets, and network cores to highly virtualized and converged corporate data centers. Working together with our wireless access solutions, these switches are, in our view, the building blocks of an integrated network that delivers scalable and advanced functionality solutions protecting, optimizing, and growing as a customer&#8217;s business needs evolve. 

NGN Routing 

Next-Generation Networking (NGN) Routing technology is fundamental to the foundation of the Internet. This category of technologies interconnects public and private wireline and mobile networks for mobile, data, voice, and video applications. Our NGN Routing portfolio of hardware and software solutions consists primarily of physical and virtual routers, and routing and optical systems. Our solutions are designed to meet the scale, reliability, and security needs of our customers. In our view, our portfolio is differentiated from those of our competitors through the advanced capabilities, which we sometimes refer to as &#8220;intelligence,&#8221; that our products provide at each layer of the network infrastructure to deliver performance in the transmission of information and media-rich applications. 

We offer a broad range of hardware and software solutions, from core network infrastructure and mobile network routing solutions for service providers, and enterprises to access routers for branch offices and for telecommuters and consumers at home.

Cloudlock provides additional visibility and control directly in SaaS, platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments through application program interfaces (APIs) that enable a rapid deployment, and quick time to value for customers. 

During fiscal 2016, we further built upon the offerings from the Sourcefire acquisition by releasing our unified threat-focused next-generation firewall (NGFW) solution. We integrated our FirePOWER Services solution (Sourcefire&#8217;s NGIPS), and our Advanced Security Appliances (ASA) software capabilities to create the Firepower NGFW software and management platform. Additionally, we introduced a new NGFW hardware series that can be enabled with our Firepower NGFW software and management solution, the high performance Firepower 4100 Series. 

In fiscal 2016, we also continued to expand our advanced threat protection portfolio. We acquired Lancope, Inc., a context-aware security analytics company. We continued to expand our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) everywhere strategy by integrating AMP with our Unified Threat Management (Meraki MX) platforms, and by integrating our ThreatGRID appliances into our AMP enabled security solution. 

Other Products 

Our Other Products category primarily consists of certain emerging technologies, and other networking products. This includes our continued investment in IoT with our acquisition of Jasper. Through this acquisition we intend to leverage new platforms to help our customers increase their volume of business, or otherwise address their most pressing challenges, in the IoT area. 

Service 

In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. 

Technical support services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently, remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system, and application software that we have developed. These services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for systems running mission-critical applications. A key example of this is our Cisco Smart Services offering, which leverages the intelligence from the installed base of our products and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment for our customers and partners. 

Advanced services are part of a comprehensive program that is focused on providing responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and expanding our advanced services in the areas of cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. 

The advanced services program supports networking devices, applications, solutions, and complete infrastructures. Our service and support strategy is focused on capitalizing on increased globalization. We believe this strategy, along with our architectural approach and networking expertise, has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors. 

Customers and Markets 

Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the customer&#8217;s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. In each of the past three fiscal years, no &#32;single customer accounted for 10% &#32;or more of revenue. Our customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector. 

Enterprise 

Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1,000 or more employees. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We plan to take advantage of the network-as-a-platform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers. &#160; 

Commercial 

We define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1,000 employees. We sell to the larger, or midmarket, customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses, or organizations with fewer than 100 employees, require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners. 

Service Providers 

Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers worldwide. This customer market category includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, as well as Internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service provider market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based services, content-based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our routing and switching, optical, security, video, mobility, and network management products, systems, and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach. 

Public Sector 

Public sector entities include federal governments, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector entities have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We sell to public sector entities through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as through direct sales. 

Sales Overview 

As of the end of fiscal 2016 , our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of approximately 25,500 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in 95 countries, and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. 

Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators. 

Distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point of sales information provided by these distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. 

For information regarding risks related to our channels, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factors entitled &#8220;Disruption of, or changes in, our distribution model could harm our sales and margins&#8221; and &#8220;Our inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.&#8221; 

For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factors entitled &#8220;Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;&#8221; &#8220;Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations;&#8221; &#8220;Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;&#8221; &#8220;We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;&#8221; and &#8220;Man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results,&#8221; among others. 

Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers. 

Financing Arrangements 

We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include the following: 

Leases: 

&#8226; Sales-type 

&#8226; Direct financing 

&#8226; Operating 

Loans 

Financed service contracts 

Channels financing arrangements 

End-user financing arrangements 

Product Backlog 

Our product backlog at July 30, 2016 &#32;was approximately $4.6 billion , an increase of 1% &#32;year over year, after excluding the fiscal 2015 year-end balance of SP Video CPE Business backlog. Our product backlog at July 25, 2015 was approximately $5.1 billion, including SP Video CPE Business backlog. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Subscription-based sales arrangements are not included in product backlog. Our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules. Additionally, orders can be canceled without significant penalties. As a result of these factors, we do not believe that our product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period. 

Acquisitions, Investments, and Alliances 

The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. Our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation, which we sometimes refer to as our &#8220;build, buy, and partner&#8221; approach. The foregoing is a way of describing how we innovate: we can internally develop, or build, our own innovative solutions; we can acquire, or buy, companies with innovative technologies; and we can partner with companies to jointly develop and/or resell product technologies and innovations. The combination of technological complexity, and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services. We work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions, investments, and alliances. To summarize, we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking, and communications products and services: 

&#8226; 

Developing new technologies and products internally 

&#8226; 

Acquiring all or parts of other companies 

&#8226; 

Entering into joint development efforts with other companies 

&#8226; 

Reselling other companies&#8217; products 

Acquisitions 

We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product. No assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factor entitled &#8220;We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.&#8221; 

Investments in Privately Held Companies 

We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factor entitled &#8220;We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.&#8221; 

Strategic Alliances 

We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation. Companies with which we have, or recently had, strategic alliances include the following: 

Accenture Ltd; Apple Inc.; AT&#38;T Inc.; Cap Gemini S.A.; Citrix Systems, Inc.; EMC Corporation; LM Ericsson Telephone Company; Fujitsu Limited; Inspur Group Ltd.; Intel Corporation; International Business Machines Corporation; Italtel SpA; Johnson Controls Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; NetApp, Inc.; Oracle Corporation; Red Hat, Inc.; SAP AG; Sprint Nextel Corporation; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.; VCE Company, LLC (&#8220;VCE&#8221;); VMware, Inc.; Wipro Limited; and others. &#32; 

Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factor entitled &#8220;If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.&#8221; 

Competition 

We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services for transporting data, voice, and video traffic across intranets, extranets, and the Internet. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity, and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. 

Our competitors include Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; ARRIS Group, Inc.; Avaya Inc.; Blue Jeans Networks, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Citrix Systems, Inc.; Dell Inc.; Extreme Networks, Inc.; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; International Business Machines Corporation; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; Microsoft Corporation; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; Polycom, Inc.; Riverbed Technology, Inc.; Symantec Corporation; Ubiquiti Networks and VMware, Inc.; among others. &#32; 

Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated within the data center. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits offering advanced services, standards-based protocols, cloud computing, and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, 

previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. 

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include: 

&#8226; 

The ability to sell successful business outcomes 

&#8226; 

The ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services 

&#8226; 

Product performance 

&#8226; 

Price 

&#8226; 

The ability to introduce new products, including products with price-performance advantages 

&#8226; 

The ability to reduce production costs 

&#8226; 

The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection 

&#8226; 

Conformance to standards 

&#8226; 

Market presence 

&#8226; 

The ability to provide financing 

&#8226; 

Disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology, and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. Therefore, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success. &#32; 

Research and Development 

We regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of Switching, NGN Routing, Collaboration, Service Provider Video, Data Center, Wireless, Security, and Other Product technologies. Our research and development expenditures were $ 6.3 billion , $6.2 billion , and $6.3 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. These expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time. Recent areas of increased focus include, but are not limited to, our core routing and switching products, collaboration, security and products related to the data center. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred. 

The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance, and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of internetworking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance. 

Manufacturing 

We rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 or ISO 9003 standards. 

Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time, defined as less than one year. 

Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. 

Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. 

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; including the risk factors entitled &#8220;Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,&#8221; &#8220;We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,&#8221; and &#8220;We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.&#8221;
