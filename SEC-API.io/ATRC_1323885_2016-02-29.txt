Overview 

We are a leading atrial fibrillation ( Afib ) solutions partner providing innovative products, professional education and support for clinical science to reduce the economic and social burden of atrial fibrillation. We have several product lines for the ablation of cardiac tissue , including our &#160; Isolator &#174; Synergy Ablation System , the first and only surgical device approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent and longstanding persistent forms of Afib in patients undergoing certain open concomitant procedures. We also offer a variety of minimally invasive ablation devices and access tools to facilitate the growing trend in less invasive cardiac and thoracic surgery. Our cryoICE &#174; cryosurgery &#160; product line offers a variety of cryoablation devices. Our &#160; AtriClip &#174; Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion System is the most wi dely sold device worldwide specifically designed to occlude the heart&#8217;s left atrial appendage (LAA) . We believe cardiothoracic surgeons are adopting our ablation and LAA management (LAAM) devices for the treatment of Afib and reduction of Afib - relate d complications such as stroke. 

Cardiothoracic surgeons have adopted our radiofrequency (RF) ablation and cryoablation systems to treat A fib in an estimated 195,000 patients since 2004 , and we believe that we are currently the market leader in the surgical treatment of A fib . &#160; Our products are utilized by cardiothoracic surgeons during both open-heart and minimally invasive surgical procedures , either on a concomitant or sole-therapy basis . During a concomitant procedure, the surgeon ablates cardiac tissue and/or exclude s the left atrial appendage, secondary, or concomitant, to a primary cardiac procedure such as a valve repair or replacement or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) . Our Isolator Synergy System, which includes our Isolator Synergy clamps, RF generator and related switchbox , &#160; is approved &#160; by FDA &#160; for the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib concomitant to other open-heart surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve replacement or repair. To date, none of our other products have been approved by FDA &#160; specifically for the treatment of A fib . Our 510(k)-cleared RF and cryo ablation products are indicated for the ablation of cardiac tissue and/or treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, our cryoICE probe is cleared for blocking pain by temporarily ablating peripheral nerves. Our AtriClip products are 510(k)-cleared with an indication for occlusion of the LAA, under direct visualization, concomitant to other open cardiac surgical procedures. We recently acquired nContact Surgical, Inc. (nContact&#8482;), a leader in minimally invasive technology for epicardial ablation. &#160; We also have a line of reusable surgical instruments typically used for cardiac valve replacement or repair. We anticipate that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will relate to products we currently sell, or are in the process of developing, which surgeons use to ablate cardiac tissue, &#160; to exclude the left atrial appendage , to perform mitral and aortic valve replacement and repair and/or to ablate peripheral nerves during cardiothoracic surgery. &#160; 

A fib affects approximately 1% of the population in the United States. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, encountered in clinical practice and accounts for more doctor visits and hospital days than any other cardiac arrhythmia. When a patient is in A fib, abnormal electrical impulses cause the atria, or upper chambers of the heart, to fibrillate, or quiver, at rapid rates of 400 to 600 beats per minute. As a result, blood in the atria may become static, increas ing the risk that a blood clot will form and cause a stroke or other serious complications. Symptoms of A fib may include heart palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath, and these symptoms may be debilitating and life threatening in some cases. Patients often progress from being in Afib intermittently to being in Afib continuously. A fib &#160; often occurs in conjunction with other cardiovascular disease s , including hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery disease and valvular disease. 

In the United States of America we sell our products to medical centers through our direct sales force. AtriCure Europe , B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated and based in the Netherlands, markets and sells our products throughout Europe and the Middle East . &#160; I n certain markets, such as Germany , France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux region, sales are made directly to medical centers , with the remaining sales being made through distributors . In other international markets we sell our products to 

&#160;

distributors who in turn sell them to end users . Our business is primarily transacted in U.S. D ollars with the exception of transactions with our European subsidiary which are transacted in Euros or British Pounds . 

AtriCure, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 31, 2000 in connection with a spin-off transaction from Enable Medical Corporation (Enable) in which shares of our common stock were distributed to Enable shareholders. The spin-off was intended to allow us to focus on the development of products designed to treat A fib and to raise capital for that purpose, while Enable continued its broader research and manufacturing activities. On August 5, 2005, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. On August 10, 2005, we acquired Enable Medical Corporation, the manufacturer of our Isolator clamps, which are an essential part of our Isolator Synergy System. On December 31, 2013, we acquired Endoscopic Technologies, Inc. (Estech &#174; ), a medical device company focused primarily on RF ablation products used in cardiothoracic surgery. On October 13, 2015, we acquired nContact , a medical device company focused primarily on minimally invasive epicardial ablation products. We have two operating subsidiaries: (i) AtriCure Europe, B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands in December 2005 and (ii) AtriCure, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware in October 2012. 

Market Overview 

A fib is the most commonly diagnosed sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and affects more than 30 million people worldwide, including more than five million &#160; in the United States . According to data from the Framingham Heart Study, a study originally undertaken by the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute), it is estimated that the incidence of A fib doubles with each decade of an adult&#8217;s life. At age 40, remaining lifetime risk for A fib is 26% for men and 23% for women. A fib is an under-diagnosed condition due in large part to the fact that patients with A fib often have mild or no symptoms and their A fib is only diagnosed when they seek treatment for an associated condition, such as a stroke or heart disease. We believe that increasing awareness of A fib and improved diagnostic screening will result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with A fib . Also, since the prevalence of A fib increases with age, there will likely be an increase in the number of diagnosed A fib patients in the United States as the population ages. We believe that the same trends in the United States apply globally, as in many geographies incidence of Afib is increasing as the population ages. &#160; 

A fib is a condition that doctors often find difficult to treat and, historically, there has been no widely accepted long-term cure for A fib . This difficulty is exacerbated with more serious forms of Afib, which are typically classified as &#8220;persistent&#8221; and &#8220;long-standing persistent&#8221; Afib. Doctors typically begin treating A fib with drugs, which are often ineffective, not well-tolerated and may be associated with serious side effects , including the risk of bleeding . Patients who cannot effectively be treated with drugs may be candidates to undergo catheter-based procedures to treat their A fib . To perform a catheter ablation, an electrophysiologist inserts a flexible catheter into the inside of the heart, typically through the femoral vein . Catheter-based procedures , especially for more serious forms of Afib, are generally not indicated for patients with persistent or long-standing persistent Afib because they ar e often technically challenging and can be associated with serious complications . Multiple clinical studies have shown that catheter ablation for the more serious forms of Afib produces inconsistent results. Implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, are sometimes used to reduce the frequency and symptoms of A fib although they are not designed to treat the underlying disease. In the past, an open-heart surgical procedure known as the &#8220;cut and sew Maze&#8221; was used to treat A fib , but this procedure has not been widely adopted because it is technically challenging, highly invasive and involves long recovery times. 

Of the patients undergoing open-heart surgery globally , we estimate that over 250,000 &#160; are potential candidates for surgical ablation using our products. Today, we estimate that approximately 25-30% of those candidates are being treated in one form or another, but many of these are not treated properly or fully. Of the population diagnosed with A fib , a large percentage of these patients are symptomatic and do not respond to drug therapy or are intolerant to the drugs used to treat A fib . Additionally, there is a large population of patients who have no other underlying cardiac disease but who suffer from serious forms of Afib. Many of these patients fail traditional therapies, and thus we believe could benefit from a minimally invasive or hybrid A fib treatment using our products. 

In addition, Afib is thought to be responsible for approximately 15% to 20% of the estimated 700,000 strokes that occur annually in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, the risk of stroke is five times higher in people with Afib. Approximately 35% of Afib patients will have a stroke in their lifetime, and Afib-related strokes tend to be severe. Studies suggest that 25% of people who have an Afib-related stroke die within the first thirty days following their stroke and more than 40% are permanently bedridden. Afib accounts for $6,700,000 in hospitalization-related costs in the United States each year and an estimated $5,000 in office visits annually. Indirect costs, such as the management of Afib-related strokes, are believed to be significant. Because of the risk of stroke, and the significant cost burden on the healthcare system, more and more surgeons are routinely addressing the LAA in procedures performed to treat Afib. In addition, current practice guidelines state that the LAA should be excluded or removed, when possible, during cardiac surgery in patients at risk of developing postoperative Afib. We believe that our AtriClip system is safer, more effective and easier to use than other products and techniques for excluding the LAA, and, because of this, we believe that the market for the AtriClip system is large and represents a significant growth opportunity. 

&#160;

The AtriCure Solution and Products 

Competing surgical and catheter-based ablation devices are not ideal for safely, rapidly and reliably creating lesions that completely and permanently block the abnormal electrical impulses that cause A fib , particularly for patients with more chronic forms of A fib or patients who have failed single or multiple catheter ablations. O ur products, including our Isolator Synergy System, enable cardiac surgeons to mimic the &#160; cut and sew Maze procedure but with a faster, less invasive and less technically challenging approach . &#160; 

Our clinical studies for the use of our products to treat A fib are ongoing. Leading cardiothoracic surgeons and electrophysiologists, including those who serve or who have served as consultants to us, have published results of initial clinical studies utilizing our Isolator Synergy System. The results of these studies are promising in terms of efficacy, ease of use and safety. 

We have two primary product lines for cardiac tissue ablation and a product line for left atrial appendage exclusion: 

Product lines for cardiac tissue ablation: 

1.) 

R adio Frequency Ablation Devices. &#160; Our Isolator Synergy System and related RF devices, such as our multifunctional pens, represent our primary product line and generate a substantial majority of our revenue. Physicians use the &#160; Isolator Synergy System and related RF devices in both open and minimally invasive procedures . These devices primarily consist of the following products: 

&#183; 

Isolator Synergy &#160; and Isolator Synergy Access &#174; &#160; Clamps. We sell multiple configurations of our Isolator Synergy clamps. One configuration is optimized for ablation during open-heart procedures and others for minimally invasive procedures. All of our clamps are single-use disposables and have jaws that close in a parallel fashion. The parallel closure compresses tissue and evacuates the blood and fluids from the energy pathway in order to make the ablation more effective. 

&#183; 

Isolator Synergy &#160; Ablation and Sensing Unit &#160; ( ASU ) . &#160; The ASU is a compact generator that delivers bipolar radio &#160; frequency energy to our Isolator Synergy c lamps, pens and the Coolrail &#174; linear ablation device. We generally place our ASU with our direct customers and sell it to our distributors. 

&#183; 

AtriCure Switch Box &#160; ( ASB ) . Our ASB is a compact switch box which provides the technology needed for the dual pulsing electrodes in our Isolator Synergy clamps as well as the ability to connect and toggle between our multiple RF devices. We generally place our ASB with our direct customers and sell it to our distributors. 

&#183; 

Isolator Multifunctional Pen s . Isolator multifunctional pens are disposable RF devices t hat come in two configurations &#8212; one that makes linear ablations and one that makes spot ablations. The pens enable surgeons to evaluate cardiac arrhythmias, perform temporary cardiac pacing, sensing, and stimulation and ablate cardiac tissue with the same device. When the multifunctional pens are used with the ASB, surgeons are able to toggle back and forth between temporary pacing, sensing, stimulation and ablation. S urgeons generally us e one or more of our pen devices in combination with Isolator Synergy clamps during both minimally invasive and open-heart procedures. 

&#183; 

Coolrail Linear Ablation Device. &#160; O ur Coolrail linear ablation device is a disposable linear RF ablation device designed to allow physicians to create an expanded cardiac ablation lesion set during minimally invasive procedures. We believe physicians are using our Coolrail device during minimally invasive procedures in order to improve long-term results for patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of A fib . 

&#183; 

COBRA Fusion &#174; Surgical Ablation System . &#160; The COBRA Fusion &#160; Surgical Ablation System&#8217;s Versapolar&#8482; technology combine s bipolar &#160; t emperature -c ontrolled r adio &#160; frequency (TCRF) energy control with monopolar energy . &#160; The COBRA Fusion System &#160; also incorporate s a unique suction design that draws tissue into the device to create consistent, full thickness lesions without arresting and opening the heart. Physicians use these devices in both open and minimally invasive procedures. &#160; &#160; 

&#183; 

Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) . The &#160; E SU is a compact power generator for use with COBRA Fusion ablation products . We generally place our E SU with our direct customers and sell it to our distributors. &#160; 

&#183; 

AFfirm &#174; Bipolar Pacing Probe . The AFfirm Bipolar Pacing Probe is used to test lesions created in surgically treating the patient&#8217;s arrhythmia. &#160; 

&#183; 

EPi-Sense &#174; Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax &#174; &#160; Technology . &#160; The EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology is intended for the coagulation of cardiac tissue using RF energy using thoracoscopic, endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical techniques. It may be used for temporary cardiac signal sensing and recording during surgery when connected to an external recording device. 

&#183; 

Cannula . The &#160; minimally invasive SUBTLE &#174; approach utilizes the Cannula as an access device and conduit for the ablation device and endoscope to enable a closed chest endoscopic approach. &#160; This allows surgeons direct visualization while ablating on the posterior of the heart. 

&#183; 

nContact RF Generator . The &#160; nContact RF generator is a compact power generator for use with EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology . We generally place &#160; the nContact RF generator with our direct customers and sell it to our distributors. &#160; 

&#160;

2.) 

cryoICE Cryoablation System. &#160; The cryoICE &#160; cryoablation system consists of the cryoICE BOX generator along with &#160; a range of cryoI CE single use and reusable cryosurgery probes. The cryoICE cryoablation s ystem is used to ablate cardiac tissue for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and to provide temporary pain relief to thoracic surgery patients via ablation of peripheral nerves . The probes come in a variety of configurations, with the primary difference being flexibility of the distal end of the probe. This flexibility provides for a variety of use cases covering both open and minimally invasive surgery. 

Product line for left atrial appendage management : 

AtriClip System. &#160; The AtriClip system is designed to exclude the left atrial appendage by mechanically clamping the appendage from the outside, eliminating blood flow between the left atrial appendage and the atrium while avoiding contact with circulating blood . We believe that the AtriClip system is potentially safer, more effective and easier to use than other &#160; available products and techniques &#160; for permanently excluding the left atrial appendage . The AtriClip portfolio includes a range of devices with different size clips, as well as different applier lengths and deployment features. These different configurations allow for a variety of uses covering both open and minimally invasive surgery. 

In addition to the above product lines we also sell enabling technologies including our Lumitip&#8482; dissector s and the Estech line of reusable cardiac surgery instruments . The Lumitip dissector is used by surgeons to separate tissues to provide access to key anatomical structures that are targeted for ablation. The Estech cardiac surgery instruments are used during surgical procedures for repair or replacement of certain heart valves. 

Current A fib Treatment Alternatives 

Physicians usually begin treating A fib patients with a variety of drugs intended to prevent blood clots, control heart rate or restore the heart to normal sinus rhythm. If a patient&#8217;s A fib cannot be adequately controlled with drug therapy, doctors may perform one of several procedures that vary depending on the severity of the A fib symptoms and whether or not the patient suffers from other forms of heart disease. A 2014 report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society set forth &#160; guidelines for the management of patients with Afib. The guidelines state : 

&#183; 

An Afib surgical ablation procedure is reasonable for selected patients with A fib undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications ; 

&#183; 

A stand-alone A fib &#160; surgical ablation procedure may be reasonable for selected patients with highly symptomatic Afib not well managed with other approaches. &#160; 

T reatment alternatives include: 

&#183; 

Drugs. &#160; Pharmaceutical options called anti-arrhythmics are available to treat Afib. Depending on a patient&#8217;s severity of the disease and heart condition, physicians typically administer these medications in a hospital setting with continuous monitoring. If the patient goes back into a normal rhythm, the physician will often prescribe a similar anti-arrhythmic to try to prevent a recurrence of Afib. The effectiveness of drug therapy varies based on the patient population and the drug being prescribed, among other factors. Often times, pharmaceuticals to thin the blood (anti-coagulants) are prescribed due to the increased risk of stroke for patients who also have Afib. 

&#183; 

Implantable Devices. &#160; Implantable devices, such as defibrillators and pacemakers, can be effective in reducing the symptoms and frequency of A fib episodes, but neither device is intended to treat A fib . Patients may continue to experience the adverse effects of A fib as well as some of the symptoms and complications, including dizziness, fatigue, palpitations and stroke, because the A fib continues. 

&#183; 

Catheter Ablation . Catheter ablation is an ablation procedure that is typically performed by an electrophysiologist. The ablations are made from the inside of the heart using a flexible catheter. The heart is reached via a blood vessel, most commonly through the femoral vein. In proportion to the prevalence of A fib , only a small number of catheter-based A fib treatments are performed each year in the United States. 

With the exception of the Isolator Synergy System, which may be promoted according to its FDA-approved indication for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent Afib undergoing certain open-heart procedures, we do not promote our products specifically for Afib. Nevertheless, physicians have adopted our products for use in open-heart and minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of A fib . During elective open-heart surgical procedures, such as bypass or valve surgery, cardiothoracic surgeons use our ablation systems to treat patients with a pre-existing history of A fib . Surgeons report that ablation using our products generally adds approximately 20 to 3 0 minutes to an open-heart surgical procedure. Surgeons use our products to perform cardiac procedures that may vary depending on the length of time a patient has been diagnosed with A fib and whether the patient&#8217;s A fib is intermittent, known as paroxysmal, or more continuous (non-paroxysmal) , which is typically further classified as persistent, long-standing persistent or permanent . Patients who have been diagnosed with A fib for a longer duration and have non-paroxysmal forms of A fib generally receive more extensive ablation procedures than patients who have been diagnosed with A fib for a shorter duration or who have paroxysmal A fib . Additionally, during an open-heart procedure, physicians may use our AtriClip system to exclude the left atrial appendage , which has been reported to add less than one minute to a procedure. &#160; 

&#160;

For those patients with A fib who do not require a concomitant open-heart surgical procedure, surgeons have used our Isolator clamps and related products for minimally invasive A fib treatment procedures. These procedures have generally been performed through minimally invasive incisions without the need to place patients on a heart-lung bypass machine. Surgeons have reported that the procedure takes approximately two to four hours and that the average hospitalization period has typically been two to five days. Similar to the open-heart surgical procedure, patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of A fib generally require an expanded lesion set that mimics the cut and sew Maze procedure. Our multifunctional pens are often used during these procedures to enable physicians to perform additional ablations. 

Physicians are performing an emerging minimally invasive stand-alone , staged procedure which combines epicardial (surgical) ablation (ablation on the outside of the heart) with endocardial ablation and mapping techniques (from the inside of the heart). This procedure involves hav ing the epicardial procedure performed on the first day of hospitalization and the catheter ablation and mapping performed at a later time. &#160; Physicians are reporting that they are performing this procedure, also known as a hybrid procedure, utilizing certain of our products to primarily treat patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of A fib . 

Business Strategy 

Our mission is to expand the treatment options for patients who suffer from A fib &#160; or have a high risk of stroke through the continued development of our technologies and expansion of our product offerings. The key elements of our strategy include: 

New Product Innovation. &#160; Our product development pipeline includes projects which extend and improv e our existing products, as well as research &#160; and development projects for new technologies . We plan to continue to develop new and innovative products, including those that allow us to enter new market opportunities or expand our growth in existing markets. Our product development and growth plans include continued innovation to expand on both new and existing market opportunities through either leveraging our existing product platform or developing entirely new products to serve new markets . 

Invest in Clinical Trials . We continue to invest in landmark clinical trials to validate the long term results of procedures using our products and to support applications to regulatory agencies for expanded indications. 

Provide Training and Education. We have recruited and trained sales and education professionals who have strong backgrounds in the medical device industry to effectively communicate to doctors the unique features and benefits of our technologies as they relate to their indications for use . Our highly trained sales and education professionals meet with doctors at leading institutions around the world to provide education and technical training on the features and benefits of our products . With the approval of our Isolator Synergy System for the treatment of non-paroxysmal A fib , we instituted a program to train providers on the use of the Isolator Synergy System to treat persistent A fib &#160; in patients undergoi ng open-heart surgery. We believe this training and education program has increased and will continue to increase awareness about the surgical treatment of A fib during open-heart procedures. We also provide medical information on our products in response to information requests from physicians, and we have provided educational grants to institutions that have facilitated the education of doctors concerning the treatment of A fib , including the use of our products as an A fib treatment alternative. As a result of the educational process, we believe that awareness of our technolog ies is growing and will result in the increased use of our products. 

Expan d International Markets and Ent er into New Markets. &#160; Sales to international customers &#160; represented 21 % of our total revenue for 201 5 . Many of the international markets in which we do business are underpenetrated markets which present high growth opportunities for our products. Further, we plan to continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in new geographic markets and capitalize on new product introductions. 

Engage with Key Opinion Leaders. We have formed consulting relationships with cardiothoracic surgeons who work with us to evaluate and develop our products. Additionally, we have formed advisory board s made up of key opinion leaders (KOLs) in cardiac surgery &#160; and other specialties to oversee our surgical training and clinical programs. We are also building relationships with physicians in other specialties, including electrophysiology, interventional cardiology and general thoracic surgery who are involved in the treatment of patients with Afib and thus will provide insight regarding treatment trends, input on future product direction and education for other specialties involved in treating the disease. &#160; 

Leverage Product Portfolio, Labeling and Cross-Selling Opportunities . We believe we have the most comprehensive offering of cardiac ablation and left atrial appendage exclusion products in the market. We plan to leverage our leading product portfolio to facilitate cross-selling of our products as well as to drive market share gains through competitive account conversions. 

Expand Adoption of Our Minimally Invasive Products. We believe that the catalysts for expanded adoption of our minimally invasive products include procedural advancements, such as the hybrid procedure, and the publication of peer-reviewed articles, which we believe will help validate the successful, long-term use of our products for patients with A fib . We believe that ongoing research activities, including clinical trials, new procedural techniques and anticipated presentations and publications will create an increased demand for our minimally invasive products. 

&#160;

Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities . In the past two years, we have acquired two companies that we believe further expand our ability to establish a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect to continue to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions where it makes strategic and financial sense. 

Clinical Trials 

The December 2011 FDA approval &#160; of our Isolator Synergy System include d &#160; the requirement to implement a 350-patient post-approval study (PAS) . The PAS was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of our Isolator Synergy System in the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib in patients undergoing open-heart procedures. Enrollment in the trial was completed in October 2014 with 365 patients at 40 medical centers. We expect to release preliminary data from the study in early 2016, with a complete report expected to be published in 2017. 

We conducted the Dual Epicardial Endocardial Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (Staged DEEP AF) Feasibility clinical trial to evaluate use of the Isolator Synergy System for the treatment of Afib in a two-part procedure where a minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is performed first, and an intracardiac catheter mapping and ablation procedure is then performed on a different day during the same hospitalization. Enrollment in the Staged DEEP AF Feasibility trial was completed during the fourth quarter of 2013, with 30 patients enrolled at six medical centers. 

We submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application for the Staged DEEP AF pivotal trial to FDA in May 2014. The Staged DEEP AF pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Isolator Synergy System when used in a staged approach, where a minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed, and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 90-120 days later. FDA approval to enroll up to 220 subjects at 23 domestic medical centers and two international medical centers &#160; was received during the third quarter of 2014. Enrollment began during the first quarter of 2015, and there are currently 30 patients enrolled and twelve sites initiated. 

We also conducted a Stroke Feasibility clinical trial with the AtriClip System. The trial evaluates the initial procedural safety and efficacy of the AtriClip System for stroke prophylaxis (prevention of stroke) in patients with non-valvular Afib in whom long term oral anticoagulation therapy is medically contraindicated. We had approval to enroll up to 30 patients at seven medical centers during the course of the trial. Enrollment began in the first quarter of 2014 and involved twelve patients. A Pre-Submission Meeting was held with FDA during the first quarter of 2015 to discuss the early termination of enrollment in the Stroke Feasibility clinical trial and proceeding to the pivotal trial. FDA has approved the termination of the feasibility study at twelve enrolled subjects. The pivotal trial design is under discussion with FDA. 

We are in the beginning stages of our ATLAS study, which is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating outcomes of patients with risk factors for developing postoperative Afib as well as risk of bleeding on oral anticoagulation. There are two types of patients subject to this study: &#160; &#160; those receiving prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage with the AtriClip device concomitant to cardiac surgery and those with a postoperative Afib diagnosis who are medically managed. At full capacity, we expect to enroll approximately 2,000 patients at up to twenty sites. We began enrollment in February 2016 , and there is currently one patient enrolled and two sites initiated. 

We are in the beginning stages of our c ryoanalgesia study ( FROST ) , which is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating whether intraoperative intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard of care provides improved analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy cardiac procedures as compared to current standard of care. The study will involve treatment arm subjects who will receive intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard post-operative pain management and control arm subjects who will receive standard post-operative pain management only. At full capacity, we expect to enroll 100 patients at up to five sites. &#160; We have initiated one site and expect to begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2016 . 

We are also pursuing a non-IDE trial in Europe, CEASE AF, to compare staged hybrid ablation treatment (minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 91-180 days later) versus catheter ablation alone. We expect the study to have an enrollment of approximately 210 patients across ten sites. There are currently three patients enrolled and six sites initiated. 

With the acquisition of nContact, we are conducting the CONVERGE IDE clinical trial. The CONVERGE pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the nContact EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology to treat symptomatic persistent Afib patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I and/or III anti-arrhythmic drug. We have FDA approval to enroll up to 153 subjects at fifteen domestic medical centers and two international medical centers . Enrollment began during the first quarter of 2014, and there are currently 39 patients enrolled and thirteen domestic sites initiated. 

Sales, Marketing and Medical Education 

Our global sales and marketing efforts &#160; focus on educating doctors about our unique technologies and their technical benefits. We only promote our products for uses described in their regulatory agency approved or cleared labeling . We train our sales force on the use of our products to treat A fib to the extent the products are cleared for the treatment of Afib. &#160; 

&#160;

Our sales team in the United States has approximately &#160; 112 employees supporting approximately 53 sales territories. We select our sales personnel based on their expertise, sales experience and reputation in the medical device industry , and their knowledge of cardiac surgery &#160; procedures and technologies. 

We market and sell our products in selected markets outside of the United States through independent distributors and &#160; through our European subsidiary which includes a combination of independent distributors and direct sales personnel. During 201 5 and 201 4 sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for &#160; 21 % and 25 % of our total revenue, respectively. We have a network of distributors outside of the United States who market and sell our products . They are located primarily in Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. Our international sales team includes sales representatives who sell to customers in markets we sell directly to, such as Germany , France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux region. We continue to evaluate opportunities for further expansion into markets outside of the United States. 

Competition 

Our industry is competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours. Our primary competitor is Medtronic, plc . We and our competitors provide products that have been adopted by doctors for the treatment of A fib and related conditions . Several of our competitors offer intracardiac catheter devices that are commonly used by electrophysiologists to treat Afib. Some of these catheter devices are FDA-approved to treat the paroxysmal form of Afib, but they are not FDA-approved to treat persistent or long-standing persistent Afib . AtriCure&#8217;s Isolator Synergy System is the only medical device FDA approved to treat A fib in a surgical setting, and the only medical device approved to treat persistent or long-standing persistent Afib in any form . 

We believe that our products compare favorably against competing products that are commonly used for the surgical treatment of A fib during both open-heart and sole-therapy minimally invasive procedures, although we cannot assume that we will be able to continue to do so in the future or that new devices that perform better than our products will not be introduced. We also believe that our products compare favorably to intracardiac catheter devices when used to treat non-paroxysmal forms of A fib . Further, we believe our AtriClip system is superior to all other medical devices indicated for exclusion of the left atrial appendage. 

Due to the size of the A fib and left atrial appendage exclusion markets , and the unmet need for an A fib cure, competitors have dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to develop and market their products. New product developments that could compete with us more effectively are likely because the A fib treatment and left atrial appendage exclusion markets are characterized by extensive research efforts and technological progress. 

Existing or new competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer, more effective, easier to use or less expensive than our products. To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our products are an attractive alternative to other treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of safety, efficacy, performance, ease of use, reputation, service and price. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who prefer products offered by our competitors. Competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced gross profit margins for our products over time. Technological advances may render our products obsolete or uneconomical. 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors. These payors include private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal health benefit program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and covers certain medical care items and services for eligible beneficiaries, such as individuals over 65 years old, as well as chronically disabled individuals. Reimbursement under Part A of the Medicare program includes hospitals and other institutional services, while Medicare Part B covers physician services. Because Medicare beneficiaries comprise a large percentage of the populations for which our products are used, and private insurers may follow the coverage and payment policies for Medicare, Medicare&#8217;s coding, coverage and payment policies for cardiothoracic surgical procedures are significant to our business. 

Medicare&#8217;s Part A program pays hospitals for inpatient services , such as cardiothoracic surgery, under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System ( IPPS ), which provides a predetermined payment based on the patient&#8217;s discharge diagnoses and surgical procedure(s) . Discharge diagnoses are grouped into Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groupings (MS-DRG). There are several cardiac surgery MS-DRGs associated with the surgical treatment of A fib , with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure. When an ablation device and/or LAA exclusion device is used during a concomitant open-heart procedure, Medicare&#8217;s hospital reimbursement is based upon the patient&#8217;s primary surgical procedure. Reimbursement for sole-therapy minimally invasive A fib ablation treatment is also influenced by the patient&#8217;s severity of illness. We believe hospital reimbursement rates for sole therapy and concomitant therapy cardiac surgical tissue ablation are adequate to cover the cost of our products. Medicare&#8217;s coding, coverage, and payment policies are subject to change. As a result, the continuance of current coverage, coding or payment determinations cannot be guaranteed, and any change may have an adverse impact on our business. 

&#160;

Doctors are reimbursed for their services separately under the Medicare Part B physician fee schedule. When surgically performing a cardiac ablation with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure, surgeons report Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) codes to receive a professional fee. Surgeons have a choice of CPT codes to report sole-therapy and concomitant therapy cardiac tissue ablation. At this time, there are no CPT codes for the physician to report surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage. &#160; 

In addition to the Medicare program, many private payors look to CMS policies as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts. The current coverage policies of these private payors may differ from the Medicare program, and payment rates may be higher, lower, or the same as the Medicare program. If CMS or other agencies decrease or limit reimbursement payments to doctors and hospitals, this may negatively impact our business. Additionally, some private payors do not follow the Medicare guidelines and those payors may reimburse only a portion of the cost of cardiac ablation, or not at all. Physicians, in combination with their professional organizations and societies, are responding and working to secure reimbursement for the procedure to the extent the payor has denied reimbursement. 

FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. Doctors may use our products in circumstances where they deem it medically appropriate, such as for the treatment of A fib or the reduction in stroke risk , even though FDA may not have approved or cleared our products to be marketed specifically for th ose indication s . S ome pay o rs may deem the use of our products for indications not specifically approved or cleared by FDA to be experimental and, as such, may deny coverage or payment. Often times, these denials can be overcome through an appeals process, but there is no guarantee of success in these cases. &#160; 

Outside of the United States, third-party reimbursement varies widely by geography and by the type of therapy in which our devices are used. For example, e ven though a new medical device may have been approv ed for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. In certain markets outside of the United States, cost containment initiatives and health care reforms include initiatives like governmental reviews of reimbursement rate benchmarks, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures. We are actively working to pursue market access initiatives in certain geographies, which includes applying for new reimbursement for therapies in which our devices are being used. 

Government Regulation 

Our products are medical devices and are subject to regulation in the United States by FDA and other federal agencies , and by comparable authorities in other countries. All of our products marketed in the United States have been cleared by FDA pursuant to section 510(k) of the Food, Drug &#38; Cosmetic Act (FDCA). In addition, our Isolator Synergy System received Pre-Market Approval from FDA in December 2011 for the treatment of patients with persistent and long-standing persistent A fib &#160; concomitant to another &#160; open-heart surgical procedure such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or cardiac valve replacement or repair. The Isolator Synergy System was previously 510(k) cleared for the ablation of cardiac tissue, and continues to be marketed in the United States under both the 510(k) clearance and premarket approval (PMA). Our &#160; RF clamps have 510(k) clearance for the ablation of cardiac tissue. Our multifunctional pen and multifunctional linear pen have 510(k) clearance for temporary pacing, sensing, stimulating and recording during the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias , and for the ablation of cardiac tissue. Our cryoablation products have &#160; 510(k) clearance for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Our CRYO2 probes received an additional 510(k) clearance in December 2014 for blocking pain by temporarily ablating peripheral nerves. T he Lumitip dissector is 510(k) cleared for use in the dissection of soft tissues during general, ear, nose and throat, thoracic, urological and gynecological surgical procedures. The AtriClip system is 510(k) cleared for &#160; occlusion of the left atrial appendage under direct visualization in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures. The COBRA Fusion Ablation System is 510(k) cleared to ablate cardiac tissue and for temporary cardiac pacing, sensing, recording and stimulation during the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias. The AFfirm Bipolar Pacing Probe is 510(k) cleared to provide transient cardiac pacing or recording for the assessment of electrical isolation/conduction block of ablation lesions in the surgical treatment of arrhythmias. The EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology has 510(k) clearance for coagulation of cardiac tissue using RF energy using thoracoscopic, endoscopic, and laparoscopic surgical techniques, and temporary cardiac signal sensing and recording during surgery when connected to an external recording device. 

&#160; FDA regulations govern nearly all of the activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities that FDA regulates include the following: 

&#183; 

product design, development and manufacture; 

&#183; 

product safety, testing, labeling and storage; 

&#183; 

pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory; 

&#183; 

clinical investigations in humans; 

&#183; 

premarketing clearance or approval; 

&#183; 

record keeping and document retention procedures; 

&#160;

&#183; 

advertising and promotion; 

&#183; 

the import and export of products; 

&#183; 

product marketing, sales and distribution; 

&#183; 

post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, device malfunctions or other adverse events; and 

&#183; 

corrective actions, removals and recalls. 

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, most medical device s distributed commercially in the United States will require either 510(k) clearance or PMA from FDA. Other premarket pathways, such as the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) or a request for classification under section 513(a)(1) of the FDCA, commonly known as a de novo request, are also available in certain situations. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II, or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk and the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II . While most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement to submit a 510(k) notification requesting clearance to commercially distribute the device , most Class II devices are subject to the 510(k) premarket notification process. Devices deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or predicate device, are generally placed in Class III, requiring submission of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. 

510(k) Clearance Pathway. When 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a notification to FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, i.e., a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. FDA is required to respond to a 510(k) notification within 90 days of submission, but the response may be a request for additional information or data, including clinical data. As a practical matter, 510(k) clearance often takes significantly longer than 90 days and may take up to a year or more. If FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, in connection with safety and effectiveness, approval of a PMA. FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but FDA may review any manufacturer&#8217;s decision. We have made modifications to elements of our products which we believe did not require us to seek additional 510(k) clearance. 

Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA must be submitted to FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and is not otherwise exempt. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, c linical , manufacturing and labeling , to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use . 

After a PMA is submitted and FDA has determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, FDA will accept the application for filing. FDA has 180 days to review an &#8220;accepted&#8221; PMA, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. Any approvals we receive may be limited in scope or may be contingent upon further post-approval study commitments or other conditions. New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for significant modification to the device, including indicated use, manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, clinical trials for a significant risk device require the prior submission of an application for an IDE to FDA for approval. An IDE a pplication must be submitted before initiating a new clinical study. Some trials require a feasibility study followed by a pivotal trial. An IDE supplement is utilized as a means of obtaining approval to initiate a pivotal trial following the conclusion of a feasibility trial. IDE applications must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, and any available data on human clinical experience, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The animal and laboratory testing must meet FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice requirements. 

The IDE and any IDE supplement for a new trial must be approved in advance by FDA. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by FDA and each center&#8217;s Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the welfare of the research subjects and responsible for that particular clinical trial. If the product is considered a non-significant risk device under FDA regulations, only the center&#8217;s IRB approval is required. Under its regulations, the agency responds to an IDE application (amendment or supplement) for a new trial within 30 days. FDA may approve the IDE unconditionally, grant an approval with certain conditions, or identify deficiencies that must be addressed prior to the approval of the study. It is common for FDA to 

&#160;

require additional information before approving an IDE, and thus final FDA approval on a submission commonly extends beyond the initial 30 days. FDA may also require that a small-scale feasibility study be conducted before a pivotal trial may commence. In a feasibility trial, FDA limits the number of patients and centers that may participate. Feasibility trials are typically structured to obtain information on safety and to evaluate the clinical efficacy to determine the number of subjects required to demonstrate statistical significance in a pivotal trial. 

Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including , but not limited to , those relating to current good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the written informed consent of patients in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the United States. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and, in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. 

Educational Grants. FDA regulates manufacturers of medical devices and, in particular, the promotion of medical devices by manufacturers. FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine or the conduct or content of medical education conducted by third parties. Manufacturers may provide financial support for such third-party medical education programs in the form of educational grants intended to offset the cost of such programs. If the manufacturer controls or unduly influences the content of such programs, FDA considers those programs to be promotional activities by the manufacturer and thus subject to FDA regulation including promotional restrictions. &#160; 

FDA considers several factors in determining whether an educational event or activity is independent from the substantive influence of the device manufacturer, including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: 

&#183; 

whether the intent of the funded activity is to present clearly defined educational content, free from commercial influence or bias; 

&#183; 

whether the third-party grant recipient and not the manufacturer has maintained control over selecting the faculty, speakers, audience, activity content and materials; 

&#183; 

whether the program focuses on a single product of the manufacturer without a discussion of other relevant existing competitive products or treatment options; 

&#183; 

whether there was meaningful disclosure to the audience, at the time of the program, regarding the manufacturer&#8217;s funding of the program, any significant relationships between the provider, presenters, or speakers and the supporting manufacturer and whether any unapproved uses will be discussed; and 

&#183; 

whether there are legal, business, or other relationships between the supporting manufacturer and the provider or its employees that could permit the supporting manufacturer to exert influence over the content of the program. 

We seek to ensure that the activities we support pursuant to our educational grants program are in accordance with these criteria for independent educational activities. However, we cannot provide an assurance that FDA or other government authorities would view the programs we have supported as being independent. 

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved. These include: 

&#183; 

FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation ( QSR ) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#183; 

labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the false or misleading promotion or the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 

&#183; 

requirements to obtain clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use; 

&#183; 

medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers comply with reporting requirements of FDA and report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 

&#183; 

post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 

&#183; 

post-market surveillance regulations which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 

&#183; 

requirements to issue notices of correction or removal, or conduct market withdrawals or recalls where quality or other issues arise. 

&#160;

Under FDA&#8217;s MedWatch regulation, we must submit a &#160; Medical Device Report ( MDR ) to FDA &#160; within 30 days whenever we receive information that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or that one of our products malfunctioned in a manner which, if the malfunction were to recur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Our products are often used to treat very ill patients in highly complex surgeries, only a small portion of which may involve our products, and it is frequently difficult to determine whether our products caused or contributed to a patient injury or death that occurred during or after the procedure. If we are unable to determine whether our product caused or contributed to a death or serious injury in the particular case, or that a malfunction of the type reported would not cause death or serious injury, we submit an MDR on the case. O ther incidents, including serious injuries or deaths, which occurred during procedures utilizing our products and that are not the subject of MDRs, may occur either because we are not aware of those incidents or because our investigation determined that the incident did not involve a malfunction of an AtriCure device and/or that an AtriCure device did not cause or contribute to a serious injury or death. 

In addition to FDA regulation, the advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 

We have registered with FDA as a medical device manufacturer and listed our devices . FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by FDA and our Notified Body to determine our compliance with the QSR , the European Union&#8217;s Medical Device Directive (MDD) and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 

Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA or other federal or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions, among others: 

&#183; 

warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

&#183; 

customer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; 

&#183; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

&#183; 

suspension or termination of our clinical trials; 

&#183; 

refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; 

&#183; 

withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and 

&#183; 

criminal prosecution. 

Fraud, Abuse and False Claims. We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued a series of regulations, known as the &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. 

The Federal False Claims Act ( FCA ) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States Government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, on behalf of the government, has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers included the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward. 

&#160;

The Advanced Medical Technology Association ( AdvaMed ) is one of the primary voluntary United States trade associations for medical device manufacturers. This association has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. We have adopted the AdvaMed Code and incorporated its principles in our standard operating procedures, sales force training programs, and relationships with doctors. Key to the underlying principles of the AdvaMed Code is the need to focus the relationships between manufacturers and healthcare professionals on matters of training, education and scientific research, and limit payments between manufacturers and healthcare professionals to fair market value for legitimate services provided and payment of modest meal, travel and other expenses for a healthcare professional under limited circumstances. We have incorporated these principles into our relationships with healthcare professionals under our consulting agreements, payment of travel and lodging expenses, grant making procedures and sponsorship of third-party conferences. In addition, we have conducted training sessions for employees on these principles. However, we cannot provide any assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws. 

Regulation Outside of the United States. Sales of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval and the requirements may be different. 

In the European Union, various directives and voluntary standards regulat e the design, manufacture and labeling of medical devices. Devices may only be placed on the market in the European Union if they comply with the essential requirements of a relevant directive and bear the CE mark. Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices comply with the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment will include a review of documentation relating to the device and may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s device. Successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure allows a manufacturer to issue a declaration of conformity with the requirements of the relevant directive and affix the CE mark to the device. Devices that bear the CE mark may be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union and other countries that comply with or mirror the medical device directives. A notified body has granted us a certificate of compliance with the International Organization for Standardization, (ISO) 13485:2003 Quality Management System. Compliance with this standard establishes the presumption that our quality system conforms with the essential requirements or the relevant directive . We have successfully completed the conformity assessment procedure and affix ed the CE Mark to our Isolator Synergy clamps , allowing us to commercialize those clamps in the European Union for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, including Afib . Our Isolator Synergy pen s , Coolrail linear pen and Isolator Synergy Access clamps are CE Marked to ablate soft tissue. Our Isolator linear pen is CE marked to ablate cardiac tissue and temporarily pace, sense, record, and stimulate during evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias. Our cryosurgery devices &#160; are CE Marked for the trea tment of cardiac arrhythmias. Our AtriClip LAA Exclusion System is CE marked for occlusion of the heart's left atrial appendage. &#160; Our COBRA Fusion Ablation System is CE marked for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, such as Afib , by coagulating cardiac tissue involved in the conduction of the arrhythmia. The COBRA Fusion System is also intended for use in the treatment of Afib , by ablating cardiac tissue involved in the conduction of the arrhythmia and to provide transient cardiac pacing, sensing, recording and stimulation for the assessment of electrical isolation / conduction block of ablation lesions in the surgical treatment of arrhythmias. The AFfirm Bipolar Pacing Probe is CE marked to provide transient cardiac pacing or recording for the assessment of electrical isolation / conduction block of ablation lesions in the surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The Numeris System and the EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology have CE mark with an indication for the coagulation of cardiac tissue using RF energy during cardiac surgery for the treatment of arrhythmias including Afib or atrial flutter. 

Intellectual Property 

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business and we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our interests. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights in the continued development and commercialization of our technologies and products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights is important to our continued success. We will be able to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks or copyrights or are effectively maintained as trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. 

We hold numerous issued United States and international patents. We also have multiple pending United States and international patent applications. We seek patent protection relating to technologies and products we develop in both the United States and in selected foreign countries. While we own much of our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information, we also license patents and related technology of importance to the commercialization of our products. For example, to continue developing and commercializing our current and future products, we may license intellectual property from commercial or academic entities to obtain the rights to technology that is required for our research, development and commercialization activities. 

&#160;

All of our employees and technical consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also generally require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with their relationship with us. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We devote significant resources to obtaining patents and other intellectual property and protecting our other proprietary information. If valid and enforceable, these patents may give us a means of blocking competitors from using infringing technology to compete directly with our products. We also have certain proprietary trade secrets that may not be patentable or for which we have chosen to maintain secrecy rather than file for patent protection. With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we have chosen to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. 

Manufacturing 

We manufacture a majority of the disposable and implantable products we sell and generally purchase items that would be deemed capital equipment, including the ASU, ASB , ESU, nContact RF generator and &#160; ORLab &#174; cardiac monitoring system . We assemble, inspect, test and package the majority of our products at our facility in Ohio , and our products are sterilized by third parties . Purchased components are generally available from more than one supplier. However , some products, such as our ASU , ASB, ESU and nContact RF generator , are critical components of our RF ablation lines and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply available. We generally carry a six-month supply of these products . &#160; However , obtaining a replacement supplier for the ASU , ASB, ESU or nContact RF generator , if required, may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs. Generally, our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase any of our supplies from them. 

Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components. There are no unique or proprietary processes required in manufacturing our components. We generally do not have contractual obligations that preclude us from developing products or sourcing components from new suppliers. 

We and our component suppliers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation ( QSR ) and International Organization for Standardization standard 13485 (ISO 13485) . The QSR and ISO 13485 regulate the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections that may be announced or unannounced and may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Our failure or the failure of our suppliers to maintain compliance with the QSR could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We also could be subject ed to injunctions, product seizures, or civil or criminal penalties. 

We regularly audit our suppliers for compliance with QSR and applicable ISO standards. We have been an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer since November 2002. We obtained our CE Mark in June of 2002 , and our quality systems and facility practices are certified to ISO 13485:2003; MDD 93/42/EEC, or CE Mark, and CMDCAS, or Canadian regulations. We believe that we are currently in good standing with FDA. Our current quality system is developed to comply with QSR and ISO standards. 

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control. We may incur significant costs to comply with those laws and regulations now or in the future, but, as we currently believe we are in compliance with such laws and regulations, we do not expect that continued compliance will have a material impact on our business. 

Consulting Relationships 

We have developed consulting relationships with scientists and physicians throughout the world to support our research and development , clinical and training and education &#160; programs . We work closely with these thought leaders to understand unmet needs and emerging applications for the treatment of A fib . 

Our physician consulting agreements are intended to satisfy the requirements of the personal services &#8220;Safe Harbor&#8221; regulation as well as the AdvaMed and Eucomed Codes. As such, they provide for payment of a fair market value fee only for legitimate services actually rendered to us . We do not expect or require the consultant to utilize or promote our products, and consultants are required to disclose their relationship with us as appropriate, such as when publishing an article in which one of our products is discussed. Amounts paid to U.S. physicians are disclosed by us in annual reports submitted to CMS under the federal &#8220;Open Payments&#8221; law and implementing regulations and under similar U.S. state and international laws, rules and regulations.

Employees 

We had &#160; approximately 430 full -time employees as of January 31, 2016 . None of the employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good although we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience such work stoppages in the future.
