 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160; 

The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on September 19, 2013 to become a diversified Partnership serving energy companies throughout North America. We currently provide independent pipeline inspection and integrity services to producers and pipeline companies and water and environmental services with SWD facilities to U.S. onshore oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies. On January 21, 2014, we completed the IPO of our limited partner common units. As part of the transaction, affiliates of Holdings, conveyed an aggregate 50.1% interest in the TIR Entities in exchange for an aggregate 15.7% ownership in the Partnership. Affiliates of Holdings held the remaining 49.9% interest in the TIR Entities that was acquired by the Partnership effective February 1, 2015. As a result, the Partnership now owns 100% of the TIR Entities. 

&#160; 

Our business is currently organized into three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (&#8220;PIS&#8221;), (2) Integrity Services (&#8220;IS&#8221;) and (3) Water and Environmental Services (&#8220;W&#38;ES&#8221;). We also have a number of other lines of business in our IRS private letter ruling (&#8220;PLR&#8221;) that would allow us to further diversify our business activities and lines of business serving the energy industry. 

&#160; 

Through the PIS segment, we provide independent inspection services to various energy, public utility and pipeline companies in both the United States and Canada. Inspectors in this segment perform a variety of inspection services on midstream pipelines, midstream assets and infrastructure, gathering systems and distribution systems, including data gathering and supervision of third-party construction, inspection, and maintenance and repair projects. Results in this segment are driven primarily by the number and type of inspectors performing services for our customers and the fees they charge for those services, which depend on the nature and duration of the project. PIS is mainly comprised of the historical operations of the TIR Entities. 

&#160; 

The IS segment primarily provides hydrostatic testing services to major natural gas and petroleum companies and pipeline construction companies of newly constructed and existing natural gas and petroleum pipelines. Field personnel in this segment perform various integrity services on newly constructed and existing oil and natural gas pipelines. Results in this segment are driven primarily by the number and skill level of field personnel performing the integrity services, size and length of the pipelines inspected, the complexity of services provided, the utilization of our equipment and the nature and duration of the projects, typically based on fixed bid agreements with customers. The IS segment is mainly comprised of the historical operations of Brown. 

&#160; 

W&#38;ES provides SWD services to oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies and consists of the operations of CEP LLC, which owns and operates eight commercial SWD facilities in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and two in the Permian Basin in Texas. We generate revenue by treating produced water and flowback water and injecting the water into our SWD facilities. Results are driven primarily by the volume of water injected into our SWD facilities and the fees charged related to these services. These fees are charged on a per barrel basis and vary based on the quantity and type of saltwater disposed, competitive dynamics and operating costs. Our SWD facilities currently utilize specialized equipment, full-time attendants, and remote monitoring to minimize downtime and increase efficiency for peak utilization and are located in close proximity to existing producing wells and expected future drilling sites, making our SWD facilities economically attractive to our current and future customers. These facilities also contain oil skimming processes that remove any remaining oil from flowback and produced water that has been delivered to the sites. We then generate revenue by selling the residual oil recovered from the water treatment process. In addition to the ten SWD facilities owned by CEP LLC, our consolidated subsidiary, CES LLC, provides management and staffing services for an additional SWD facility in the Bakken Shale region, pursuant to a management agreement. CES LLC also owns a 25% member interest in the managed well. The W&#38;ES segment is directly tied to oil and gas activity and is impacted by lower commodity prices and newly completed oil and gas wells. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Relationship with Cypress Energy Holdings, LLC 

&#160; 

All of the equity interests in our general partner are owned by Holdings, which is owned by Charles C. Stephenson, Jr., various family trusts, a company controlled by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Peter C. Boylan III and Henry Cornell. Holdings&#8217; owners bring substantial industry relationships and specialized, value-creation capabilities that we believe will continue to benefit us. Mr. Stephenson has over 50 years of experience as a leader in the oil and natural gas industry. He was the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Petroleum prior to its sale to Occidental Petroleum in 2006 and is currently the Chairman of Premier Natural Resources, a private oil and natural gas exploration and production company that he co-founded. Mr. Boylan has extensive executive management experience with public and private companies and also has extensive public company directorship experience. As the owners of our general partner and the direct or indirect owners of approximately 64.6% of our outstanding limited partner interests, Holdings and its affiliates have a strong incentive to support and promote the on-going successful execution of our business plan. 

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

&#160; 

Our principal business objective is to build a diversified Partnership serving energy customers that will allow us, over time, to incrementally increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Capitalize on compelling industry fundamentals . 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

PIS . We intend to continue to position ourselves as a trusted provider of high quality inspection services, as we believe the pipeline inspection services market offers attractive long-term growth fundamentals. Over the last few years, new laws have been enacted in the U.S. that, in the future, will require operators to undertake more frequent and more extensive inspections of their pipeline assets. These requirements are independent and not tied to the current state of the oil and gas industry as a whole. Additionally, a significant portion of the pipeline infrastructure in North America was installed decades ago and is therefore more susceptible to failure and requires more frequent inspections. We believe that increasingly stringent U.S. federal and state laws and regulations and aging pipeline infrastructures will result in increased need for inspection and integrity services and higher demand for independent, third-party inspectors capable of navigating these complicated requirements. The current energy downturn has impacted our customers. However, most of our clients are investment&#8211;grade, well-capitalized companies that have long lead time projects requiring our services in addition to the ongoing maintenance and integrity work on their aging pipelines. Our business is not immune to the downturn, however, we believe that we can continue to grow organically by acquiring new customers and additional work from existing customers. We continue to grow our business development team to pursue these opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

IS . Effective May 1, 2015, we acquired Brown, effectively our Integrity Services business segment. We remain cautiously optimistic about this acquisition and the potential synergies that may develop between this segment and other current customers of the Partnership, as well as the growth and nurturing of the historical, ongoing IS business. It is our intent to capitalize on the solid structure and reputation of Brown and assist in expanding the geography of our IS business. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

W&#38;ES . We believe that the on-going water and environmental services market will continue to offer long-term growth fundamentals and we intend to maintain our position as a high quality operator of SWD facilities despite the recent downturn in the oil and gas industry as a whole. We plan to focus on pipeline opportunities with E&#38;P companies that will secure water for our SWD facilities. Regulations continue to increase and we have proven to our customers that we are a trusted and dependable service provider. Increasingly, we are seeing E&#38;P companies have their central procurement and Environment, Health and Safety ("EHS") groups inspect our SWD facilities. This trend should benefit our Partnership. Although the oil and gas industry can be cyclical in nature (as is evidenced by the current downturn), our current business strategy is such that 75% - 80% of our treated water is derived from existing wells. Although new drilling activity is currently curtailed and commodity oil prices have declined significantly, our focus will remain on the produced water that is generated for the life of an oil and gas well. With curtailed drilling activity and depressed oil prices, a portion of W&#38;ES will suffer declines in volumes and pricing until the market rebounds leading to additional drilling and completions that, in turn, generate new produced water for the life of those newly completed oil and gas wells. We intend to capitalize on the continued demand for removal, treatment, storage and disposal of flowback and produced water by positioning ourselves as a trusted, dependable provider of safe, high-quality water and environmental services to our energy customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Optimize existing SWD assets. &#160; The average age of our SWD facilities was 3.3 years at the end of 2015. We estimate that we utilized approximately 45% of the aggregate annual capacity of these facilities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our permitted capacity is much higher than our estimated capacity. We are seeking to increase the utilization of our existing SWD facilities by attracting new volumes from existing customers and by developing new customer relationships, including pipelines. In 2012, only one pipeline was directly connected to our SWD facilities. Today we have six pipelines connected to our facilities. Because many of the costs of constructing and operating an SWD facility are either upfront capital costs or fixed costs, we expect that increased utilization of our existing SWD facilities over time will lead to increased gross margin and operating cash flow in W&#38;ES. The downturn in the energy industry will continue to place pressure on both the volumes we process and the prices we are able to charge for our services. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Increase the number of pipelines connected to our SWD facilities. As more oil and natural gas producers focus on improving operational safety and reducing liability, carbon footprint, road damage and the total transportation cost associated with trucking saltwater, we anticipate that they will increasingly prefer to utilize pipeline systems to transport their saltwater directly to SWD facilities. We intend to purchase or construct, whether alone or in joint ventures, saltwater pipeline systems that connect producers to our SWD facilities or newly developed SWD facilities. We continue to focus on increasing pipeline water delivered to our facilities. Our 2015 pipeline water volumes increased 67% from 2014. As a percentage of total water volume, pipeline water was 17% in 2014 and was 30% of total water volume in 2015. We will continue to focus on these potential pipeline opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Leverage customer relationships in our business segments. We intend to pursue new strategic development opportunities with oil and natural gas producing customers that increase the utilization of our assets and lead to cross-selling opportunities between our business segments. Many customers of W&#38;ES also own gathering systems, storage facilities, gas plants, compression stations, and other pipeline assets to which we can offer pipeline inspection and integrity services. In North Dakota, new inspection rules have been proposed in the legislature that may benefit PIS and IS. In addition, we intend to enhance our relationships with our customers in PIS by broadening the services we provide, including expanding our ultrasonic nondestructive examination services. By cross-selling our service offerings and adding complementary service offerings, we believe that we can further integrate into our customers&#8217; operations and increase our profitability and distributable cash flow. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Pursue strategic, accretive acquisitions. We intend to pursue accretive acquisitions that will complement the Partnership. Our business segments operate in industries that are fragmented, giving us the opportunity to make strategic and accretive acquisitions. We exercised discipline throughout 2014 and 2015 and avoided overpaying for acquisitions. We remain optimistic that good acquisition opportunities are currently present or will present themselves in the near future. We plan to expand W&#38;ES by seeking water and solid acquisition opportunities in existing and additional high-growth resource plays throughout the U.S. that will diversify our customer base with a particular focus on pipeline opportunities directly with E&#38;P customers. In addition, provided certain opportunities fit with our strategic plan of expanding our business (like the addition of our IS segment), we intend to grow PIS and IS by acquiring other strategic pipeline service companies that will allow us to broaden the suite of services we offer our existing customer base. In addition, we expanded our PIS ownership in February 2015 by acquiring the remaining 49.9% of the TIR Entities not previously owned by the Partnership. 

&#160; 

Our Business Segments 

&#160; 

Our business is currently operated in three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (&#8220;PIS&#8221;), (2) Integrity Services (&#8220;IS&#8221;) and (3) Water and Environmental Services (&#8220;W&#38;ES&#8221;). Our IRS private letter ruling (&#8220;PLR&#8221;) also includes other lines of business. Our long-term goal continues to be focused on diversifying the Partnership into other attractive lines of business including, but not limited to, traditional midstream activities, production chemicals, remote monitoring of energy infrastructure, etc. in addition to the continued expansion and build out of our segments. For information relating to revenues from external customers, operating income and total assets for each segment, refer to &#8220; Note 14 &#8211; Segment Disclosures &#8221; of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220; Item 8. &#8211; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .&#8221; 

&#160; 

PIS 

&#160; 

Overview . &#160; We believe that PIS is a leading provider of independent inspection services to the pipeline industry. We provide services for pipelines, gathering systems, local distribution systems, equipment and facilities to our well established customer base. We provide inspection to oil and natural gas producers, public utility companies and other pipeline operators that are required by law to inspect their gathering systems, storage facilities, infrastructure, distribution systems and pipelines. Our approximately 85 pipeline inspection and integrity customers include oil and natural gas producers, pipeline owners and operators and public utility companies throughout North America. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the period from June 26, 2013 through December 31, 2013, our Canadian operations generated less than $0.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of the operating income attributable to PIS, representing less than 5% of the total PIS operating income in those years. Total long-lived assets located in Canada attributable to PIS as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $5.7 million, $2.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

PIS offers independent inspection services for the following facilities and equipment: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Transmission pipelines (oil, gas and liquids); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Oil and natural gas gathering systems; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pump and compressor stations; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Storage facilities and terminals; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Gas distribution systems. 

&#160; 

Operations. Oil and natural gas producers, public utility companies and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law and regulation to inspect their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis in order to protect the environment and ensure the public safety. At the beginning of an engagement, our personnel meet with the customer to determine the scope of the project and related staffing needs. We then develop a customized, detailed staffing plan utilizing our proprietary database of more than 12,000 professionals. Our inspectors have significant industry experience and are certified to meet the qualification requirements of both the customer and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;). As the industry continues to adopt new technology, demand has increased for inspectors with greater technical skills and computer proficiencies. Our customers require inspectors to undergo specific training prior to performing inspection work on their projects. We utilize the National Center for Construction Education and Research and Veriforce training curricula to train and evaluate employees, along with other resources. In addition to assignment-specific training, welding inspectors and coating inspectors also must meet special certification requirements. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from June 26, 2013 through December 31, 2013, we employed or engaged an average of 1,392, 1,535 and 1,706 inspectors, respectively, in the U.S. and Canada. Through CF Inspection, a nationally approved Diverse Business Enterprise (woman-owned business), in which we own a 49% interest, we intend to provide services to current and future customers, including public utilities that have incentives to contract with minority and other diverse business enterprises. 

&#160; 

Our scope of services include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Project coordination (construction or maintenance coordination for in-line pipeline inspection projects); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Staking services (marking a dig site for surveyed anomalies); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pig tracking services (mapping and tracking of third-party pipeline cleaning and inspection units, called pigs); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Maintenance inspection (third-party pipeline periodic inspection to comply with PHMSA regulations); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Construction inspection (third-party new construction inspection / oversight on behalf of owner); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Ultrasonic nondestructive examination services (using high-frequency sound waves to detect pipeline imperfections); and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Related data management services. 

&#160; 

IS 

&#160; 

Overview . The IS segment provides hydrostatic testing and related services to the pipeline industry, including major natural gas and petroleum companies, as well as pipeline construction companies. We focus on helping our customers meet regulatory pipeline integrity requirements. The company&#8217;s primary emphasis is on recurring hydrostatic testing projects required to maintain compliance with state and federal regulations. We perform all aspects of pipeline hydrostatic testing including filling, pressure testing, and dewatering. Unique test conditions, such as ultra-high pressure tests and pneumatic or nitrogen testing, are performed on a routine basis as well. We provide services on newly constructed and existing natural gas and petroleum pipelines. 

&#160;

Operations . Oil and natural gas producers, midstream operators, public utility companies and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law to perform routine maintenance on their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis. In addition, operators and or pipeline construction companies are required to integrity-test newly constructed pipelines prior to placing them in service. In the IS segment, we contract directly with pipeline owners or with pipeline construction companies to provide testing services. We own and operate our own fill and testing equipment, including specially designed test trailers. We use a range of fill and pressure equipment to accommodate projects of various sizes. The segment averages approximately 30 to 35 field technicians performing the testing services. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

W&#38;ES Segment 

&#160; 

Overview. Through W&#38;ES, which specializes in water and environmental services, we own and operate ten SWD facilities, eight of which are in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and two of which are in the Permian Basin in west Texas. One of the North Dakota facilities was acquired effective December 1, 2014 and is connected to a pipeline with a large public E&#38;P company&#8217;s production. In addition to owning and operating the ten SWD facilities, we manage another SWD facility which is 25% owned by CES LLC that we built for third parties in the Bakken Shale region. W&#38;ES is comprised of the operations of CEP LLC and its Predecessor. 

&#160; 

Operations. W&#38;ES currently generates revenue by providing the following services: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Flowback water management. We dispose of flowback water produced from hydraulic fracturing operations during the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Fracturing fluids, including a significant amount of water, are originally injected into the well during the completion process and are partially recovered as flowback water. When it is removed, this flowback water contains salt, chemicals and residual oil. The drilling and completion phase typically occurs during the first 30 to 90 days following commencement of production of the life of a well. The oil and natural gas producer typically either transports the flowback water to one of our SWD facilities via pipeline or by truck or contracts with a trucking company for transport. Once the water is received at the SWD facility, we treat the water through a combination of separation tanks, gun barrels and chemical processes, store as necessary prior to injection and then inject into the SWD well at depths of at least 4,000 feet. Like produced water, we assess the composition of flowback water in our facilities so that we can maximize oil separation and treat the water to maximize the life of our equipment and the wellbore. We believe our approach to scientifically and methodically filtering and treating the flowback water prior to injecting it into our wells helps extend the life of our wells and furthers our reputation as an environmentally conscious service provider. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Produced water management. We dispose of naturally occurring water that is extracted during the oil and natural gas production process. This produced water is generated during the entire lifecycle of each oil and natural gas well. While the level of hydrocarbon production declines over the life of a well, the amount of saltwater produced may decline more slowly or in some cases, may even increase over time. The oil and natural gas producer separates the produced water from the production stream and either transports it to one of our SWD facilities by truck or pipeline or contracts with a trucking company to transport it to one of our SWD facilities. Once we receive the water at one of our SWD facilities, we filter and treat the water and then inject it into the SWD well at depths of at least 4,000 feet. We also maintain the ability to store saltwater pending injection. All of our existing facilities were constructed using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices. We periodically sample, test and assess produced water to determine its chemistry so that we can properly treat the water with the appropriate chemicals that maximize oil separation and the life of the wells. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Byproduct sales. Before we inject flowback and/or produced water into an SWD well, we separate the residual oil from the saltwater stream. We then store the residual oil in our tanks and sell it to third parties. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Management of existing SWD facilities. In addition to the SWD facilities we own or lease, we own CES LLC, a management and development company that manages an additional SWD facility in North Dakota. Our responsibilities in managing an SWD facility typically include operations, billing, collections, insurance, maintenance, repairs and, in some cases, sales and marketing. We are compensated for management of this facility generally based on the gross revenue of the facility. 

&#160; 

The majority of our disposed saltwater volumes are derived from produced water that is generated throughout the life of the oil or natural gas well. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, produced water represented approximately 93%, 82% and 75%, respectively, of our total barrels of disposed water. This differentiates us from many competitors that focus on flowback and the associated skim oil revenue. As a region matures and the predominant activity shifts from drilling and completion of wells to production, our facilities continue to experience demand for ongoing processing of waste produced over the life of the wells. 

&#160; 

Each of our SWD facilities are open 365 days per year. Our locations in North Dakota currently include onsite offices and sleeping quarters for our employees while they are on call. In Texas, we have an office and housing for management at our Pecos, Texas facility. We supplement our operations with various automated technologies to improve their efficiency and safety. We have installed 24-hour digital video monitoring and recording systems at each facility. These systems allow us to track operations and unloading as well as identifying the identity of customers at our facilities. We believe that our commitment to operating our facilities with sophisticated technology and automation contributes to our enhanced operating margins and provides our customers with increased safety and regulatory compliance. We anticipate that more of our SWD facilities will be run through technological automation with off-site monitoring and control. Our facilities have been inspected and approved by several of our public E&#38;P companies that have stringent approval standards and field audits performed by their EHS groups. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The amount of saltwater disposed in our SWD facilities decreased 0.2 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 18.9 million barrels as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to increased competition, as well as decreased oil and gas well activity in the regions we serve. The volume of saltwater decreased slightly from 19.7 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 19.1 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decline of approximately 3%, driven primarily by increased competition. Numerous new facilities opened during 2014 that competed for business with our locations. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of approximately 115,000 barrels of maximum daily disposal capacity in the following SWD facilities, all of which were built using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices and utilizing well depths of at least 5,000 feet with injection intervals beginning at least 4,000 feet beneath the surface. Our permitted capacity is much higher.

Principal Customers 

&#160; 

PIS 

&#160; 

Customers of PIS are principally oil and natural gas producers, pipeline owners and operators and public utility or local distribution companies with infrastructure in North America. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PIS had approximately 85 customers. The five largest customers in this segment generated approximately 58%, 65% and 71% of our segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the period from June 26, 2013 through December 31, 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had three customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment revenues. For the period from June 26, 2013 through December 31, 2013, two pipeline inspection services customers accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenue. 

&#160; 

IS 

&#160; 

IS customers are primarily pipeline construction companies and in some instances, the pipeline owners. During the period from May 1, 2015 (acquisition date) through December 31, 2015, we had 61 customers. Our ten largest customers in terms of revenue generated approximately 70% of our total segment revenue. We had two customers that each generated 10% or more of the total segment revenues. 

&#160; 

W&#38;ES 

&#160; 

W&#38;ES customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, including majors and independents, trucking companies and third-party purchasers of residual oil operating in the regions that we serve.

Our ten largest customers generated approximately 62%, 60% and 55% of W&#38;ES revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was one customer that generated 10% or more of W&#38;ES revenue. There were no customers for the year ended December 31, 2013 that generated 10% or more of W&#38;ES segment revenues. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

PIS 

&#160; 

The pipeline inspection business is highly competitive. PIS&#8217; competition consists primarily of three types of companies: independent energy inspection firms, engineering and construction firms, and diversified inspection service firms. Diversified inspection firms may inspect, for example, electric and nuclear facilities in addition to pipelines. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include gaining and maintaining customer approval to service their pipelines and gathering systems, the ability to recruit and retain qualified experienced inspectors with multiple skills and non-destructive examination experience, safety record, insurance, the level of inspector training provided, reputation, dependability of services, customer service and price.

The pipeline integrity services business is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are customer service and price. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional integrity firms. 

&#160; 

W&#38;ES 

&#160; 

The oilfield waste treatment, water and environmental services, and disposal business is highly competitive with relatively low entry barriers. During 2014, competitors opened a number of new locations around our existing facilities based upon anticipated new drilling activity prior to a downturn in the oil and gas industry beginning in November 2014. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographical markets. In addition, we face competition from other large oil field service companies that also own trucking operations and our customers, who may have the option of using internal disposal methods instead of outsourcing to us or another third-party disposal company. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include gaining and maintaining customer approval of treatment and SWD facilities, location of facilities in relation to customer activity, reputation, safety record, reliability of services, track record of environmental &#38; regulatory compliance, customer service, insurance and price. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

PIS 

&#160; 

Inspection work varies depending upon the geographic location of our customers. As we expand our relationships with public utility commissions in California and other locations with moderate climates, the seasonality of our inspection and integrity business is expected to decline. The third and fourth quarters are historically the most active for our pipeline inspection services as our customers focus on completing projects by year end. In addition, our Canadian customers use inspection services the most during the fourth and first quarters of the year when the tundra is frozen. We believe our presence across various regions in the U.S. and our presence in Canada helps mitigate the seasonality of our business. 

&#160; 

IS 

&#160; 

As most of the work in this segment is currently performed in the southern United States, weather does not create a seasonality issue. However, business has historically been slower in the first calendar quarter, presumably due to the budgeting cycles of our customers. 

&#160; 

W&#38;ES 

&#160; 

The overall operations and financial performance of our Bakken Shale operations are impacted by seasonality. The volume of saltwater that we handle in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota tends to be lower in the winter due to heavy snow and cold temperatures, and in the spring due to heavy rains and muddy conditions that may lead to road restrictions and weight limits that can impact business. The amount of residual oil is also less prevalent and more difficult to separate from the saltwater during the winter months when the outside temperature is lower. Seasonality is not typically a major factor in the Permian Basin in west Texas, however, the 2013-2014 winter saw more ice and snow than normal leading to reduced activity as reported by a number of large E&#38;P companies operating in the region. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Industry 

&#160; 

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the discharge of materials and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with our operations; restrict the way we handle or dispose of wastes; limit or prohibit our or our customers&#8217; activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our current or former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protections. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties and even criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, these rules and regulations are constantly evolving, and amendments thereto could result in a material effect on our operations and financial position. Further, while we may occasionally receive citations from environmental regulatory agencies for minor violations, such citations occur in the ordinary course of our business and are not material to our operations. However, it is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. Moreover, changes in environmental laws could limit our customers&#8217; businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of oil and natural gas wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business. For example, as a result of regulations issued in March 2014, all waste haulers transporting produced water in North Dakota must possess a valid permit for transporting solid waste from the North Dakota Department of Health to legally transport such waste. Texas already required the same. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or future cash flows. 

&#160; 

Hazardous substances and wastes. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid wastes, hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historical activities or spills). These laws may also require us to conduct natural resource damage assessments and pay penalties for such damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. 

&#160; 

Petroleum hydrocarbons and other substances arising from oil and natural gas-related activities have been disposed of or released on or under many of our sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination. We will continue to perform such monitoring and remediation of known contamination, including any post remediation groundwater monitoring that may be required, until the appropriate regulatory standards have been achieved. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by state environmental regulatory agencies. We estimate that we will incur costs of less than $0.1 million over the next one to three years in connection with continued monitoring and remediation of known contamination at our facilities. 

&#160; 

In the future, we may also accept for disposal solids that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Most Exploration &#38; Production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) waste is exempt from stringent regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. None of our facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes for disposal, and we take precautions to help ensure that hazardous wastes do not enter or are not disposed of at our facilities. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as &#8220;hazardous wastes&#8221; under RCRA or other applicable statutes. For example, in September 2010, a nonprofit environmental group filed a petition with the EPA requesting reconsideration of the RCRA E&#38;P waste exemption. To date, the EPA has not taken any action on the petition. If the RCRA E&#38;P waste exemption is repealed or modified, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We are required to obtain permits for the disposal of E&#38;P waste as part of our operations. These regulations vary widely from state to state. State permits can restrict pressure, size and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive and the overall capacity of a waste disposal facility. States may add additional restrictions on the operations of a disposal facility when a permit is renewed or amended. As these regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. 

&#160; 

In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials, or NORM. NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM. 

&#160; 

Safe Drinking Water Act. Our underground injection operations are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries. In addition, storage of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process prior to sale could impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws. 

&#160; 

Our customers are subject to these same regulations. While these largely result in their needing our services, some waste regulations could have the opposite effect. For instance, some states, including Texas, have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water. If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some saltwater to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities. 

&#160; 

Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, as amended, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners or operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. We handle oil at many of our facilities, and if a release of oil into the regulated waters occurred at one of our facilities, we could be liable for cleanup costs and damages under the OPA. 

&#160; 

Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act, referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in regulated waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters, and permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities, including many of our facilities. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture or leak. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with existing permits and regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Future changes to permits or regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, however, could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Many states also have analogous laws designed to protect endangered or threatened species. 

For example, the lesser-prairie chicken was listed as threatened in March 2014, although a district court recently vacated this decision. Additionally, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the Fish and Wildlife Service&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Although current listings have not had a material impact on our operations, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species under the ESA or similar state laws could limit our ability to expand our operations and facilities or could force us to incur material additional costs. Moreover, listing such species under the ESA or similar state laws could indirectly, but materially, affect our business by imposing constraints on our customers&#8217; operations, including the curtailment of new drilling or a refusal to allow a new pipeline to be constructed. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Air emissions. Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The Clean Air Act, or CAA, and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere above certain specified quantities or in a manner that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to CAA permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state &#8220;minor source&#8221; air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements for air emissions. 

&#160; 

Our customers&#8217; operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations. The EPA recently approved and proposed new CAA rules requiring additional emissions controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations. The rules also establish new emission requirements for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing and certain other equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These rules may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons, and as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of oilfield waste delivered to our facilities by our customers. 

&#160; 

Climate c hange . The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, that, for example, require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was expanded in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has in the past considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA and other federal and state agencies have also acted to address greenhouse gas emissions in other industries, most notably coal-fired power generation, and as a result could attempt in the future to impose additional regulations on the oil and natural gas industry. 

&#160; 

Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but effects could be materially adverse. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic fracturing . We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment and disposal services with respect to the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations, which are often necessary to drill and complete new wells and maintain existing wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Several states, including Texas and North Dakota, where we conduct our water and environmental services business, have either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases including fracfocus.org, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations. 

&#160; 

At the federal level, the SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program and generally exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection.&#8221; The U.S. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. 

&#160; 

Federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process within their jurisdiction. For example, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and proposed effluent limitations for the disposal of wastewater from unconventional resources to publicly owned treatment works. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (&#8220;DOI&#8221;) published a rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. This rule has been stayed pending the resolution of various legal challenges. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The EPA is conducting a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water. The EPA released a draft of its report for peer review and public comment in 2015. As part of this study, the EPA requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other governmental authorities, depending on their results, could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. 

Occupational Safety and Health Act. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA&#8217;s hazard communications standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes. Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil and/or criminal fines and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position. 

&#160; 

Seismic activity . Several states have acted to address a growing concern that the underground injection of water into disposal wells has triggered seismic activity in certain areas. Some states, including Texas, have promulgated rules or guidance in response to these concerns. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (&#8220;TRC&#8221;) published a final rule in October 2014 governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that will require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and are likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of salt water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations may be imposed to address such concerns. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Partnership does not have any employees. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner, but we sometimes refer to these individuals in this report as our employees. We are managed and operated by the directors and officers of our general partner. All of our executive management personnel are employees of CEM LLC or another affiliate of Holdings, and devote the portion of their time to our business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct our operations. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, that entity employed 27, 15 and ten people, respectively, who provide direct support for our operations, none of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Under the terms of our amended and restated omnibus agreement, we reimburse CEM LLC for the provision of various general and administrative services incurred for our benefit, for direct expenses incurred by CEM LLC on our behalf and for expenses allocated to us as a result of our becoming a public entity. In addition, PIS does not have any employees. All of the employees that conduct the PIS business do it through CEM TIR, providing the necessary personnel resources to PIS. PIS employed or engaged 1,002, 1,147 and 1,476 inspectors as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which 971, 1,131 and 1,397 were employed directly by CEM TIR. The inspectors not employed by CEM TIR are contractors engaged in our Canadian operations. The number of employees in the PIS group vary month to month and project to project. The Tulsa headquarters group of PIS consists of approximately 70 employees who were also employed by CEM TIR. Virtually all of our inspector employees are billable to clients and they work in the field on client assets and infrastructure including, but not limited to, pipelines. Our IS segment directly employed 70 individuals at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

We also had a co-employment relationship between CEM LLC and a third-party management company that employed nine and ten people as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, working at our SWD facilities in west Texas. The co-employment arrangement was terminated in January 2015 and all employees are now employed solely by CEM LLC. There were six people employed by CEM at December 31, 2015 that worked at our Texas facilities. CEM LLC also owns CEM-BO, which provides staff for our North Dakota SWD facility operations. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, CEM-BO employed approximately 28, 39 and 41 employees, respectively. CEM LLC and CEM-BO have been reimbursed a management fee to compensate them for the cost of the Texas and North Dakota employees, benefits and various other services provided to us. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Insurance Matters 

&#160; 

Our customers require that we maintain certain minimum levels of insurance and evaluate our insurance coverage as part of the initial and ongoing approval process they require to use our services to treat and dispose of their waste. We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Also, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions.

&#160;

The SWD and the pipeline inspection and integrity businesses can be dangerous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as environmental damage from leaks, spills or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent in W&#38;ES, our insurance coverage includes business, auto liability, commercial general liability, employer&#8217;s liability, environmental and pollution and other coverage. To address the hazards inherent in PIS and IS, insurance coverage includes employer&#8217;s liability, auto liability, employee benefits liabilities, and contractor&#8217;s pollution and other coverage. Coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations and are commonly provided for exclusion on such policies.
