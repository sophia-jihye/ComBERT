 Item 1 - Business 

General 

As used herein, the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Kimball Electronics,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Kimball Electronics, Inc., the Registrant, and its subsidiaries. Reference to a year relates to a fiscal year, ended June 30 of the year indicated, rather than a calendar year unless the context indicates otherwise. Additionally, references to the first, second, third, and fourth quarters refer to those respective quarters of the fiscal year indicated. 

Overview 

Kimball Electronics was incorporated in 1998 and is a global provider of engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services to customers in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety end markets. We offer a package of value that begins with our core competency of producing &#8220;durable electronics&#8221; and includes our set of robust processes and procedures that help us ensure that we deliver the highest levels of quality, reliability, and service throughout the entire life cycle of our customers&#8217; products. We believe our customers appreciate our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of their products that require durability, reliability, the highest levels of quality control, and regulatory compliance. We deliver award-winning service from our highly integrated global footprint which is enabled by a common operating system, a standardization strategy, global procedures, and teamwork. Our Customer Relationship Management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) model is key to providing our customers convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout the entire product life cycle, making us easy to do business with. Because our customers are in businesses where engineering changes must be tightly controlled and long product life cycles are common, our track record of quality, financial stability, social responsibility, and commitment to long-term relationships is important to them. 

We have been producing safety critical electronic assemblies for our automotive customers for over 30 years. During this time, we have built up a body of knowledge that has not only proven to be valuable to our automotive customers, but to our medical, industrial, and public safety customers as well. We have been successful in growing and diversifying our business by leveraging our automotive experience and know-how in the areas of design and process validation, traceability, process and change control, and lean manufacturing to create valuable and innovative solutions for new customers in the medical, industrial, and public safety end market verticals. We have harmonized our quality systems to be compliant with various important industry certifications and regulatory requirements. This allows us to take advantage of other strategic points of leverage in the supply chain and within our operations so we can cost-effectively manufacture products for customers from all four of our end market verticals in the same production facility. 

Many of our customers are multinational companies that sell their products in multiple regions of the world. For these customers, it is important for them to be able to leverage their investment in their supply partner relationships such that the same partner provides them with engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services in multiple regions of the world. It is common for us to manufacture the same product for the same customer in multiple locations. Our strategy for expanding our global footprint has aligned us with the preferences of the customers in our four end market verticals and has positioned us well to support their global growth initiatives. Our global systems, procedures, processes, and teamwork combined with our CRM model have allowed us to accomplish this goal for many of our largest customers. 

Our global processes and central functions that support component sourcing, procurement, quoting, and customer pricing provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. We have a central, global purchasing organization that utilizes procurement processes and practices to help secure sources from around the world and to ensure sufficient availability of components and a uniform approach to pricing while leveraging the purchase volume of the entire organization. Customer pricing for all of the products we produce is managed centrally utilizing a standardized quoting model regardless of where our customers request their products to be produced. 

Our CRM model combines members of our team from within our manufacturing facilities and members of our business development team who reside remotely and nearer to our customers around the world. We also have cross functional teams in the areas of quality, operational excellence, quoting, and design engineering with representatives from our various locations that provide support to our teams on a global basis. The skill sets of these team members and the clarity in their roles and responsibilities help provide our customers with a strong conduit that is critical to execution and forming a strong relationship. We have institutionalized a customer scorecard process that provides all levels of our company with valuable feedback that helps us drive the actions for continuous improvement. Our customer scorecard process has helped us deliver award-winning service and build loyalty with our customers. 

&#32;3 

Our corporate headquarters is located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana. Production occurs in our facilities located in the United States, Mexico, Thailand, China, Poland, and Romania. 

Our services are sold globally on a contract basis and we produce products to our customers&#8217; specifications. Our engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services primarily include: 

&#8226; 

Design services; 

&#8226; 

Rapid prototyping and new product introduction support; 

&#8226; 

Production and testing of printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs); 

&#8226; 

Industrialization and automation of manufacturing processes; 

&#8226; 

Product design and process validation and qualification; 

&#8226; 

Reliability testing (testing of products under a series of extreme environmental conditions); 

&#8226; 

Assembly, production, and packaging of other related non-electronic products; 

&#8226; 

Supply chain services; and 

&#8226; 

Complete product life cycle management. 

We pride ourselves on the fact that we pay close attention to the evolving needs and preferences of our customers. As we have done in the past, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow and diversify our business by expanding our package of value and our global footprint. 

Spin-Off 

Kimball Electronics, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Kimball International, Inc. (&#8220;former Parent&#8221; or &#8220;Kimball International&#8221;) and on October 31, 2014 became a stand-alone public company upon the completion of a spin-off from former Parent. In conjunction with the spin-off, on October 31, 2014, Kimball International distributed 29.1 million &#32;shares of Kimball Electronics common stock to Kimball International Share Owners. Holders of Kimball International common stock received three shares of Kimball Electronics common stock for every four shares of Kimball International common stock held on October 22, 2014. Kimball International structured the distribution to be tax free to its U.S. Share Owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). For as long as a company is deemed to be an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies. These provisions include: 

&#8226; 

an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the &#8220;emerging growth company&#8217;s&#8221; internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies; 

&#8226; 

an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#8217;s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; 

&#8226; 

reduced disclosure about the &#8220;emerging growth company&#8217;s&#8221; executive compensation arrangements; and 

&#8226; 

an exemption from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and the requirement to obtain Share Owner approval of any golden parachutes not previously approved. 

Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We would cease to be an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; upon the earliest of: 

&#8226; 

the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, or June 30, 2020; 

&#32;4 

&#8226; 

the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; 

&#8226; 

the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or 

&#8226; 

the date on which we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer,&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 

Reporting Segment 

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Each of our business units qualifies as an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our business units meet the aggregation criteria under the current accounting guidance for segment reporting. As of June 30, 2016, all of our business units operate in the electronic manufacturing services industry with engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services that provide electronic assemblies primarily in automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety applications, all to the specifications and designs of our customers. The nature of the products, the production process, the type of customers, and the methods used to distribute the products, all have similar characteristics. Each of our business units service customers in multiple markets and many of our customers&#8217; programs are manufactured and serviced by multiple business units. Our global processes such as component procurement and customer pricing provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. All of our business units have similar long-term economic characteristics. As such, our business units have been aggregated into one reportable segment. See Item 6 - Selected Financial Data &#32;for more information regarding the Company&#8217;s financial results. 

Our Business Strategy 

We intend to achieve sustained, profitable growth in the markets we serve by supporting the global growth initiatives of our customers. Key elements of executing our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Expanding Our Global Footprint &#8211; continue our strategy with expansion in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, including new potential country locations and/or facility expansion as our customer demands dictate; and 

&#8226; 

Expanding Our Package of Value &#8211; enhance our core strengths and expand upon our package of value in areas such as complex system assembly, specialized processes, precision metals, and plastics. 

Our Business Offerings 

We offer engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services to customers in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety end market verticals. Our services support the complete product life cycle of our customers&#8217; products and our processes and capabilities cover a range of products from high volume-low mix to high mix-low volume. We collaborate with third-party design services companies to bring innovative complete design solutions to our customers. We offer Design for Excellence input to our customers as a part of our standard package of value. We use sophisticated software tools to integrate the supply chain in a way that provides our customers with the flexibility their business requires. Our robust new product introduction process and our extensive manufacturing capabilities give us the ability to execute to the quality and reliability expectations in the electronics manufacturing industry. 

We value our customers and their unique needs and expectations. Our customer focus and dedication to unparalleled excellence in engineering and manufacturing has resulted in proven success in the contract manufacturing industry. Personal relationships are important to us. We strive to build long-term global partnerships. Our commitment to support our customers is backed by our history and demonstrated performance over the past 50 years. 

Marketing Channels 

Manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain services are marketed by our business development team. We use a CRM model to provide our customers convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout the entire product life cycle. 

Major Competitive Factors 

Key competitive factors in the electronic manufacturing services (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) market include competitive pricing, quality and reliability, engineering design services, production flexibility, on-time delivery, customer lead time, test capability, and global presence. Growth in the EMS industry is created through the proliferation of electronic components in today&#8217;s advanced 

&#32;5 

products and the continuing trend of original equipment manufacturers in the electronics industry subcontracting the assembly process to companies with a core competence in this area. The nature of the EMS industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently. New customer and program start-ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program, which are generally recovered as the program becomes established and matures. We continue to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market and from our customers&#8217; own capacity and capabilities to in-source production. Our continuing success depends upon our ability to replace expiring customers/programs with new customers/programs. 

We do not believe that we, or the industry in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our EMS business other than fluctuating inventory levels which may increase in conjunction with transfers of production among facilities and start-up of new programs. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

Our competitive strengths derive from our experience of producing safety critical electronic assemblies for automotive customers for over 30 years and leveraging this experience to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in different industries. Our core strengths include: 

&#8226; 

Our core competency of producing durable electronics; 

&#8226; 

Our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of products that require high levels of quality control, reliability, and durability; 

&#8226; 

Our highly integrated, global footprint; 

&#8226; 

Our CRM model and our customer scorecard process; 

&#8226; 

Our ability to provide our customers with valuable input regarding designs for improved manufacturability, reliability, and cost; 

&#8226; 

Our quality systems, industry certifications and regulatory compliance; 

&#8226; 

Our integrated supply chain solutions and competitive bid process resulting in competitive raw material pricing; and 

&#8226; 

Complete product life cycle management. 

Competitors 

The EMS industry is very competitive as numerous manufacturers compete for business from existing and potential customers. Our competition includes EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Jabil Circuit, Inc., and Plexus Corp. We do not have a significant share of the EMS market and were ranked the 20 th &#32;largest global EMS provider for calendar year 2015 by Manufacturing Market Insider &#32;in the March 2016 edition. 

Locations 

As of June 30, 2016 , we have eight &#32;manufacturing facilities with two located in Indiana and one located in each of Florida, China, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. We continually assess our capacity needs and evaluate our operations to optimize our service levels for supporting our customers&#8217; needs around the globe. During fiscal year 2016 , the construction of our greenfield facility in Romania was completed. In addition, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a contract manufacturing company located in Indiana during fiscal year 2016 . See Item 1A - Risk Factors &#32;for information regarding financial and operational risks related to our international operations. Financial information by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 &#32;is included in Note 16 - Geographic Information &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Seasonality 

Sales revenue of our EMS business is generally not affected by seasonality. 

Customers 

While the total electronic assemblies market has broad applications, our customers are concentrated in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety industries. 

&#32;6 

Sales by industry as a percent of net sales for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 &#32;were as follows:

The nature of the contract business is such that start-up of new customers to replace expiring customers occurs frequently. Our agreements with customers are often not for a definitive term and are amended and extended, but generally continue for the relevant product&#8217;s life cycle which can be difficult to predict at the beginning of a program. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular product, subject to contractual provisions governing the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory and end-of-life pricing, which reduces the additional costs that we incur when a product purchase agreement is terminated. We continue to focus on diversification of our customer base. 

As previously announced, volumes with JCI have declined significantly due to certain JCI programs reaching end-of-life and JCI&#8217;s decision to in-source other programs. Volumes for one of our largest contracts with JCI, which accounted for approximately $46 million &#32;in sales in fiscal year 2014, declined in fiscal year 2015 to $6 million &#32;as certain JCI programs reached end-of-life. In addition, during fiscal year 2014 , due to available capacity, JCI decided to in-source other programs that were manufactured by us, which accounted for approximately $33 million &#32;in sales during fiscal year 2014 and approximately $16 million &#32;in sales during fiscal year 2015. The transition to JCI&#8217;s in-sourcing occurred in stages and began in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, with the transition substantially completed during fiscal year 2015. Gross profit as a percent of net sales on the JCI product approximated the overall Kimball Electronics gross margin percentage. A significant portion of that volume already has been replaced with new business. 

Backlog 

The aggregate sales price of production pursuant to worldwide open orders, which may be canceled by the customer subject to contractual provisions, was $171.0 million &#32;and $194.3 million &#32;as of June 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. Substantially all of the open orders as of June 30, 2016 &#32;are expected to be filled within the next fiscal year. Open orders may not be indicative of future sales trends. 

Raw Materials 

Raw materials utilized in the manufacture of contract electronic products are generally readily available from both domestic and foreign sources, although from time to time the industry experiences shortages of certain components due to supply and demand forces, combined with rapid product life cycles of certain components. In addition, unforeseen events such as natural disasters can and have disrupted portions of the supply chain. We believe that maintaining close communication with suppliers helps minimize potential disruption in our supply chain. 

Raw materials are normally acquired for specific customer orders and may or may not be interchangeable among products. Inherent risks associated with rapid technological changes within this contract industry are mitigated by procuring raw materials, for the most part, based on firm orders. We may also purchase additional inventory to support new product introductions and transfers of production between manufacturing facilities. 

&#32;7 

Research and Development 

Research and development activities include the development of manufacturing processes, engineering and testing procedures, major process improvements, and information technology initiatives. 

Research and development costs were approximately:

Intellectual Property 

Our primary intellectual property is our proprietary manufacturing technology and processes which allow us to provide very competitive electronic manufacturing services to our customers. As such, this intellectual property is complex and normally contained within our facilities. The nature of this know-how does not lend itself well to traditional patent protection. In addition, we feel the best protection strategy involves maintaining our intellectual property as trade secrets because there is no disclosure of the information to outside parties, and there is no expiration on the length of protection. For these reasons, we do not own any patents and our only registered trademark is the &#8220;Kimball&#8221; name as registered in certain categories relating to our electronics manufacturing and design services, which were assigned to us by former Parent. 

Environment and Energy Matters 

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items. 

We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Management believes capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the two fiscal years ending June 30, 2018 &#32;will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures during those years. 

Our operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and electricity. Federal, foreign, and state regulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production due to such regulations. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 , Kimball Electronics employed approximately 4,500 people worldwide, with approximately 850 located in the U.S. and approximately 3,650 located in foreign countries. Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Most of our foreign operations are subject to collective bargaining arrangements, many mandated by government regulation or customs of the particular countries. We believe that our employee relations are good.
