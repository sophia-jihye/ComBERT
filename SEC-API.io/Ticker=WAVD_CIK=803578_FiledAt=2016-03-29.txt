 Item 1. Business 

Overview of Market 

Founded in 1979, Information Analysis Incorporated (&#8220;We&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), to which we sometimes refer as IAI, is in the business of developing and maintaining information technology (IT) systems, modernizing client information systems, and performing professional services to government and commercial organizations. Since its inception, we have performed software development and conversion projects for over 100 commercial and government customers including, but not limited to Small Business Administration, Computer Sciences Corporation, IBM, Computer Associates, Sprint, Citibank, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of Education, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and Department of Veterans Affairs. At present, we primarily apply our technology, services and experience to developing web-based and mobile device solutions (including electronic forms conversions) for various agencies of the federal government, data analytics, cyber security applications and legacy software migration and modernization 

Digital Solutions Marketplace 

The web, digital content, and cloud solutions market continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the information technology professional services business as small and large companies, and government agencies (state and federal) expand their presence via Cloud implementations and on the Internet. The range of products and services involved in this sector is extensive and therefore, require some specialization for a small company such as IAI to make an impact. Most small web companies are involved in building websites and typically have many short duration projects. More complex web applications generally require knowledge of customers&#8217; back-end systems based on mainframe or mid-level computers. Few small companies have the expertise to develop these more sophisticated web applications. We distinguish ourselves among smaller companies by having such expertise, typically associated with larger companies, both internally and through strategic business relationships with leading-edge software firms, such as Adobe Systems. 

&#160;

Given executive level directives to improve outreach to its stakeholders, federal and state government agencies are now empowered to find means of facilitating dissemination of information quickly and efficiently. Government requirements are unique in that most government processes are based on forms. Many government agencies rely on thousands of internal and external forms to conduct their business. Any company that wishes to develop governmental web applications must competently address the forms issue. Adobe electronic forms related products resold and supported by IAI as a Solutions Partner are the predominant forms software in the federal government. 

Over the last few years there has been a pronounced emphasis within the U.S. federal government to employ more form data entry and citizen communication using mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, and mobile devices employing the Android operating system. Working with Adobe&#8217;s latest version of Adobe Experience Manager, we have been able to build applications for several federal clients employing mobile devices, as well as converting paper-based forms into &#8220;dynamic&#8221; or &#8220;adaptive&#8221; forms. 

Cyber Security and Digital Analytics 

Certain applications, including innovative solutions in the business intelligence and cybersecurity arenas, should become more prominent in the future as web-based solutions continue to evolve. The need for commercial and public sector managers to access and combine data from disparate sources (internally and externally) for timely decision-making and fraud protection is becoming ever more acute in our fast paced digitally driven environment. The volume of data available to companies and agencies is growing at an exponential rate, as well as the need to protect that data and the systems that house them. This convergence of the need for instantaneous reliable access to real-time data via the web, combined with protecting such information from tampering and theft by unauthorized sources, should result in increased opportunities for IAI&#8217;s evolving capability skill set. 

With the recent disclosures of damaging information hacks at prominent companies and federal agencies, many business intelligence advisory entities, such as Deltek, indicate that funds budgeted toward cyber security solutions will grow dramatically for the foreseeable future and beyond. To compete for these new opportunities, IAI has recently created a Cyber Security Practice with components that include, but are not limited to information assurance, computer network defense, program management, enterprise security architecture, digital content security, big-data fraud protection, and encryption protection of files and communications. 

Legacy Migration and Modernization 

The migration and modernization market is complex and diverse as to the multiple requirements clients possess to upgrade their older systems. Many large legacy systems remain in use because of the enormous cost to re-engineer these systems. Currently, the options available to modernize these systems are many and include introduction of new hardware systems, employing advanced software languages, and utilization of the Internet or Intranet to achieve desired efficiencies. All of these options are typically very expensive and time consuming because they require starting all over in defining requirements, designing structures, programming, and testing. 

Opportunities for our modernization expertise may be expanding as government agencies and private companies are being driven for various reasons to address the upgrading of their legacy systems. One reason is the difficulty of finding and retaining staff with outdated technical skills, many of which are possessed only by senior programmers nearing retirement. Hardware platforms such as Unisys are reaching the horizon of their usefulness, and consequently, older programming and data base languages are generally poorly supported by their providers. Additionally, maintenance costs are materially increasing as vendors squeeze the most out of clients before the life-cycles of hardware and software expire. In addition, the Internet has added a new level of pressure to compete in the electronic marketplace with sector rivals. We expect that this remaining decade should see an upsurge of movement and change as organizations revamp their older legacy systems. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

A segment of mainframe users is interested in simply updating their legacy systems without drastic rewritings to these systems in newer languages or adapting expensive enterprise products (such as SAP or Oracle) to their needs. These potential customers are looking for automated tools that can quickly and cost-effectively move applications onto cheaper computer platforms without the risk of failure. IAI, in conjunction with strategic partners, such as Micro Focus and Software Mining, offers its own conversion tool set and those of its partners in addressing this need and positioning us to uniquely deliver successful results. It is difficult to determine the exact size of this segment, but even a minor share of this market would represent significant prospective customers with meaningful opportunities. 

&#160;

Description of Business and Strategy 

With the advent of mobile and digital technology applications becoming widespread in everyday life, coupled with government agencies seeking better ways to improve outreach to its stakeholders, we intend to capitalize on our proven expertise in this arena and capture new business opportunities that are likely to arise in the foreseeable future. This includes the conversion of paper-based forms into digitally compatible &#8220;dynamic&#8221; and &#8220;adaptive&#8221; forms, as well as developing mobile and Internet based applications that replace cumbersome paper handling processes currently in use by diverse organizations. 

We are using the experience we have acquired as an Adobe Solutions Partner and Reseller to help secure engagements for web-based applications requiring forms. The Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) products have evolved over the years into robust tools that can form the backbone of applications, especially those requiring forms and web content management. We have used this expertise to penetrate a number of federal government clients such as the Internal Revenue Service and Veterans Affairs and build sophisticated web applications at the Department of Homeland Security. One such application, a parking and transit subsidy tool, was cited for award recognition by the American Council for Technology &#8211; Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) and Federal Computer Week&#8217;s Fed 100 Awards. Our knowledge of legacy system languages has been instrumental in connecting these web applications to legacy databases residing on mainframe computers. Our company has built a core group of professionals that can continue to build this practice over the coming years. 

Concentrating on the niche of electronic forms-related web applications (including securing digital content and documents) through our solutions partner relationship with Adobe AEM products, we have developed a cadre of professionals that can quickly and efficiently develop web applications. We will focus on federal government clients during 2016 and beyond and leverage the company&#8217;s reputation with existing federal customers to penetrate other agencies. We will be able to reference successful projects completed or in development for various components of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, General Services Administration, Army Reserve, and U.S. Air Force Logistics Command. 

As an example of our capability, IAI was contracted by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) to provide technical and design support to complete development of an enhanced Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) that incorporates drop-down menus, helper text and hover text that embed the instructions into the form, field logic, error messages and form validation into a fillable PDF format. IAI&#8217;s successful programming of the enhanced form per our client&#8217;s requirements led to the form&#8217;s recent release to the public by USCIS for review and comment. 

In an effort to increase IAI&#8217;s profile and visibility in the expanding digital technology marketplace, IAI personnel have actively participated in industry programs such as the Adobe Digital Government Assembly, which bring together senior government officials, technology leaders and information technology leaders interested in advances in digital technology applications. IAI senior staff typically participates in related panel discussions and IAI exhibits its digital related competencies and innovative capabilities to the attendees. 

We recognize the need to enhance our service and product capabilities as a means of expanding our business base and maintaining growth in the future. To that end, over the last several years, we have aggressively pursued strategic business relationships with certain leading-edge technology firms in our local area that have developed unique and innovative software-based products and services. These new business areas include, but are not limited to, data analytics, cybersecurity, real-time data analytics, business intelligence, and mobile applications. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Where appropriate, we have entered into teaming arrangements or product reseller agreements with certain of these firms. These products and services are synergistic to our present business strategy and also allow us to expand into new business areas, both within the federal government and commercial sectors, without the expenditure of significant technical development dollars. Our partners benefit by our potential to leverage their new technology developments into our existing client base, as well as utilize our expertise and credibility in developing applications around their inventive products. 

Along this line we have entered into a partnership with a company, Neo Technology, which has developed a state of the art software suite called Neo4j, which provides analysts with unprecedented capabilities to search multiple sources of data in performing data analytics. It is an open source graphical database that is being used by a number of large corporations and analytical entities for multiple purposes including fraud detection and prevention. Graph databases offer new methods of uncovering fraud and scams with a high-level of accuracy, and are capable of stopping fraud scenarios in real-time before their impact can become excessively damaging. We have invested in training our people and establishing a reseller agreement to solicit the federal marketplace as both a reseller of the software and provider of information technology services for building applications. 

Global Industry Analysts said in an August 24, 2014 report that the mobile security market will reach $14.4 billion &#160; by 2017. The report, "Mobile Security: A Global Strategic Business Report," reviewed trends for all major commercial, healthcare and government geographic markets. In recognition of this emerging market, IAI entered into a Reseller agreement in 2015 with Protected Mobility, LLC, a Virginia based company founded in 2010 (also known as Global Integrity) to meet a critical need to provide a secure messaging capability for unprotected personal cellular devices deployed with US troops. Protected Mobility continues to develop unique secure solutions to ensure privacy of communications, documents and other key assets and, since 2010, has provided hundreds of thousands of devices/software applications to private enterprises and US government agencies. IAI is presently in discussion with several federal civilian agencies about adopting this mobile device technology. 

In addition, in connection with Protected Mobility, IAI intends to offer unique product and information technology solutions to combat the types of mobility, computer and communications threats seriously affecting the well-being of military and government organizations, healthcare organizations, as well as private companies. To that end, we are also principally supporting the design, development and beta testing of a new product designed to encrypt and secure email communications and application files using Microsoft Office (Word/Excel/Power point) and Outlook software. We intend to begin marketing and selling the product upon successful completion of the beta test program. 

In February 2016, we announced the hiring of Irene M. Carter as a Director of our newly formed Cyber Security Practice. In her role as Director, Ms. Carter will be actively involved in development of this new business model centered on cyber security, computer network defense, information assurance, enterprise architecture security, program management, secure communications, and information protection. Ms. Carter has over 12 years of experience in providing in-depth security assessments of complex IT networks, analysis of architecture vulnerabilities, drafting remediation configuration plans, enhancement of security standards and procedures, as well as developing best practices for secure cloud and mobile device implementations. Ms. Carter holds a Master of Science in Information Systems Technology from George Washington University School of Business. In addition she holds an IT Certification from the GSA CIO University and is CISSP certified. 

Since the mid-1990&#8217;s we have migrated customers, both private firms and government agencies, from older computer languages generally associated with legacy computer systems to more modern languages used with current-day computer system platforms. As part of this modernization, many organizations wish to extend these legacy systems to interface with web-based applications. Our strategy has been to develop and/or acquire tools through strategic relationships that will facilitate the modernization process and differentiate our offerings in the marketplace. 

In 2004, we aligned with Micro Focus, an established company in the legacy COBOL environment, to jointly participate in the conversion of large legacy mainframe systems to PC and Unix server platforms. Micro Focus has developed a suite of products that simplify the conversion process and enable the entry screens to be Internet accessible. As an authorized reseller and installer of the Micro Focus tools, our plan is to derive revenue from software sales and installation services as well as acquire supplementary programming services that typically may occur with each engagement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have structured our company to address the wide range of requirements that we envision the market will demand. We believe that the use of our proprietary ICONS legacy conversion tools suite and that of our strategic partners will give us a competitive edge in performing certain conversions and migrations faster and more economically than many other vendors. The diverse capabilities of our staff in mainframe technology and client-server implementations help to assure that our staff can analyze the original systems properly to conduct accurate and thorough conversions both from a technical and business perspective. In addition, our modernization methodology has evolved over time through the successful completion of numerous conversion projects. 

Our strategy to exploit the conversion and modernization market is also predicated on continuing to form alliances with large information technology consulting firms who currently maintain the legacy systems for large government agencies and Fortune 1000 companies. These alliances have resulted in significant opportunities in the past and are likely to be important in procuring future business. 

Our management will generally continue to explore ways to expand our current market spaces and develop new ones that may offer more opportunity. This may take the shape of organic growth or through acquisition of other companies. In any event, IAI will be aggressive and will take more risks in terms of investment in business development, exploring the potential of diversified business opportunities, and seeking targets of acquisition. In addition, we are seeking federal government opportunities slated for small businesses in which IAI would take a prime role in multi-year Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts and coordinate teaming arrangement in support of the contract&#8217;s requirements. We expect to see the results of these efforts near term during 2016 and beyond. 

Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015, we estimated our backlog at approximately $11.4 million over the next three years, of which $4.0 million was funded. This backlog consists of outstanding contracts and general commitments from current clients. We regularly provide services to certain clients on an as-needed basis without regard to a specific contract. General commitments represent those services which we anticipate providing to such clients during a twelve-month period. 

Competition 

In the ever expanding realm of enterprise-based web content management systems, there are a number of small and large companies offering such software products and related consulting services. We believe that the Adobe Experience Manager product suite will continue to dominate in the future against such competition, including offerings such as Microsoft&#8217;s SharePoint solution. AEM has performed well in the federal marketplace due to its full offering of powerful capabilities such as Cloud integration and intuitive customization. Adobe Experience Manager is a solution that optimizes the authoring, management and delivery of digital media and content across owned channels, including Web, mobile, email, print and social communities. In 2015, Gartner named Adobe as a leader for the third year in a row in its Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. 

There are hundreds of firms performing traditional information technology services, business intelligence and cybersecurity, and general consulting for the federal government. A great number of them are much larger than IAI, and are more established in the marketplace, and have more resources to pursue individual prospects. 

The competition in the conversion and modernization market is very strong. Many software professional services companies have had some involvement in this area and profess proficiency in performing these projects. We also face competition from other companies that purport to substantially automate the process through software tools including Blue Phoenix Solutions, Fujitsu, and IBM. Software for enterprise resource planning, such as SAP and Oracle, provides an additional source of competition, although to date, the cost and lengthy installation time for enterprise resource planning software has slowed its implementation in the market place. No matter what type of solution is offered, many of our competitors have greater name recognition than our company, a larger, more established customer base, and significantly greater financial and market resources. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

We are bound by various rules and regulations promulgated by the federal government and agencies thereunder. We have not experienced undue expense beyond those expenses normally incurred in our ordinary course of business in adhering to such rules and regulations. Since historically most of our business is derived from contracts either directly with the U.S. federal government or as a subcontractor on behalf of U.S. federal government customers, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government. 

Intellectual Property 

We depend upon a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, databases and software. We have not filed any patent applications covering our methodologies and software. In addition, we attempt to protect the secrecy of our proprietary databases and other trade secrets and proprietary information through agreements with employees and consultants. 

We also seek to protect the source code of our proprietary ICONS legacy code conversion tools suite as trade secrets. The copyright protection accorded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data can be protected, the actual data is not, and others are free to create software performing the same function. We believe, however, that the creation of competing databases would be very time consuming and costly. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 21 full-time and 3 part-time individuals. In addition, we maintained subcontractor relationships with companies and individuals that add 8 individuals for professional information technology services. Approximately 99% of our professional employees have at least four years of related experience. For computer related services, we believe that the diverse professional opportunities and interaction among our employees contribute to maintaining a stable professional staff with limited turnover. 

We have no collective bargaining agreements or other such labor contracts with our employees and believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. In the long-term, management will likely hire additional staff to meet its anticipated growth requirements. We do not anticipate encountering material problems in our ability to hire individuals with the requisite employee skill sets, despite a competitive market for our requisite technical skill sets and government clearances, when required. We utilize fee-based recruiting firms when it is necessary to speed up the process of locating and hiring employees with specialized skill sets and clearances.
