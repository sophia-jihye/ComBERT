 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

General Information About Pack Fuerte, Inc. 

Pack Fuerte, Inc. was incorporated by Mr. Miguel Alonso Peralta, former sole officer and director in the State of Nevada. On November 26, 2012 Mr. Peralta had resigned his positions as sole officer and director of Pack Fuerte, Inc. and Mr. Bunloet Sriphanorm had been appointed as the new sole officer and director. November 30 th has been established as the Company&#146;s fiscal year end. 

Initially, Mr. Sriphanorm was expected to become a member of the board. Mr. Peralta was unable to fulfill his fiduciary duties as president and CEO due to personal reasons; therefore, Mr. Sriphanorm purchased the 11,500,000 shares (initially issued to Mr. Peralta) at par value in a private transaction.

We are a development-stage Company that intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. We plan on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property for Pack Fuerte products for luggage manufacturing companies, after we successfully develop our prototype(s).

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings since its incorporation nor has it been involved in any reclassification, merger or consolidation. We have no plans to change our business activities. 

We intend to develop our prototype and then quote prices in order to find the suitable manufacturer for mass production. We believe that, with funds available, we can have an advantageous position and more confidence for negotiations with suppliers: we can negotiate better prices for payment in advance, set up lunch meetings and trips to negotiate in person and hire translators which could expand our possibilities for international negotiations for suppliers, if necessary.

Currently the Company doesn&#146;t have enough funds to develop our prototype(s). For these reasons, our main concern as of the date of this prospectus is to employ our efforts in this offering in an effort to raise the necessary capital through the sale of our common stock.

The Company does not own or rent any property. Or business office space is provided by our president at no charge.

Fuerte has no plans to change its business activities or partner with another business and is not aware of any circumstances or events that might cause this plan to change.

As of November 30, 2015 our president and director has invested $11,500 in the Company. During the period of December 2013, 30 other investors have invested a further $5,350 in the Company through the purchase of common shares. Despite our efforts to raise funds through the share sale, more funds would be necessary to continue our business plan, or we will need to cease operations entirely. 

If we are unable to complete any phase of our business plan or marketing efforts because we don&#146;t have enough money, we will cease our development and/or marketing activities until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our business plan would be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional funds we will have to cease operations and investors will lose their entire investment.

Plan of Operation 

FUERTE believes that the sale of at least 25% of the offered shares herein would allow us to maintain our reporting status with the SEC, implement our Plan of Operations with some compromises (see below) and possibly generate revenues.

In order to generate revenue, we would have to complete all three phases described below. We believe we could possibly complete all the phases of our Plan of Operations with the sale of at least 25% of the shares offered herein (at least $34,000).

The tables below show our complete plan of operations in the under 25%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% sales scenarios:

*The Company&#146;s president has indicated that he is committed to advancing funds (up to $15,000) for the next twelve months to cover expenses to maintain the reporting status current with the SEC. There are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee Mr. Sriphanorm will lend the Company any funds

Month 1 to 12:

Internet, Office supplies and Telephone costs. Funds to be used for office supplies, internet and telephone bills. The President will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies.

Month 1 to 9: 

Development phase. We began on searching for the suitable third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product. The Company has begun communications with several Companies that currently manufacture lock boxes and safes. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc), for measurements and placement of our product. The company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developer(s). 

Developing our product consists in measuring and analyzing existing baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc) to figure out the best way to have our product in it without compromising excessive space, weight and the look of each product. At this time, we plan on having it installed on the inside back part of the baggage. Based on our initial research, we believe there is no existing safe or safe box that would be ideal for our products. We plan on using plastic to produce our safes, due to its resistance, lower weight and durability. However, we need to consider factors like: costs and availability of materials, the best possible shape for the Safe (round or sharp corners, for example), security and safety.

We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and retrieve the valuables). The best way to have the doors placed and working will also need to be developed. We would analyze the best possibility for the openings considering the width and height, the way it would open, close and lock, without compromising too much space. 

We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage.

We intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product. We&#146;d look for someone with knowledge on different materials costs, weight and resistance. 

We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s).

Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, we&#146;d have $16,443.10 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, we&#146;d only have $5,343.80. 

With a higher amount to be invested, we&#146;d be able to hire a third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product with higher qualifications and experience. We&#146;d be able to buy better/new materials and hire attorneys to secure our intellectual property.

With a lower amount to be invested, we&#146;d only be able to hire a third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product with lower qualifications and little or no experience. We could also have to negotiate a compensation based on our licensing results, if we cannot pay for their services at that time. However, there are no guarantees that this would be accepted by the developers. We&#146;d have to buy cheaper/used materials and hire an attorney to advise us on the process to secure our intellectual property.

&#160;

Also, with more funds to be used in this phase, we could develop more types of prototypes for different types of luggage. With limited funds, we&#146;d have to focus on only one type of luggage.

&#160;

&#160;

Month 9 to 10: 

&#160;

Testing phase. After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will conduct the tests.

The tests are necessary to assure quality and functionality of our final product. We plan on having the specs on size, temperature resistance, security and resistance of the Safe and locks, including shock absorption. Also important would be the final test with the end user (we would use a certain number of people to try our product).

We would need to test our product under hard circumstances (dropping it, hammering it, trying to break in, etc.), but more importantly, we are willing to consider the end user feedback and adjust our product to assure the highest quality possible.

We believe that the use of third party testing companies would be cost efficient, as it would be done in a faster and more objective, non-biased way. It is our opinion that having results from a third party would give us more credibility.

Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, we&#146;d have $10,962.40 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, we&#146;d only have $762.40. 

With a higher amount to be invested, we&#146;d be able to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests on our prototype(s).

With a lower amount to be invested, we&#146;d have to rely on acquaintances for low or no compensation and the president would be responsible for conducting all the tests.

Month 10 to 12:

Selling phase. After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.

Our brochures would have all the specs of our product and a simulated cost of implementation for our clients. Our president would hire someone to develop our brochure and if no funds are available at the time, he would try and develop our brochures himself.

Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, we&#146;d have $10,962.40 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, we&#146;d only have $1,143.10. 

With a higher amount to be invested, we&#146;d be able to hire professional photographers and hire a third party company to help us finding possible clients. We&#146;d also be able to reach a bigger number of prospected clients.

With a lower amount to be invested, we&#146;d have to take our own photos of our products and we&#146;d have to search for baggage manufactures with no help from professionals. We&#146;d be able to reach a smaller number of prospected clients. 

The Company&#146;s president will be responsible for all negotiations. 

If we are able to successfully complete the above described steps, we believe we will generate revenue. We believe that we could possibly start generating revenue with the sale of at least 25% of the shares offered herein; however, we would have to compromise our Plan of Operations. We would depend on the acceptance from the 

&#160;

&#160;

third party developers to have a compensation based on our future licensing results and we would have to focus on only one type of luggage.

Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our President will be responsible for the initial product sourcing. We intend to hire sales representatives initially on a commission only basis to keep administrative overhead to a minimum. We will use third party web designers to build and maintain our website. 

We do not expect to be purchasing or selling plant or significant equipment during the next twelve months.

We have no plans to enter into a sale of the company, an acquisition of another business or other business combination.
