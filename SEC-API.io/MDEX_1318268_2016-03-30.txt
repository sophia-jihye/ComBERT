&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

Madison Technologies Inc. (&#8220; Madison &#8221;) is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on June 15, 1998. Madison was initially incorporated under the name &#8220;Madison-Taylor General Contractors, Inc.&#8221; Effective May 24, 2004, Madison changed its name to &#8220;Madison Explorations, Inc.&#8221; by a majority vote of the shareholders. Effective March 9, 2015, Madison changed its name to &#8220;Madison Technologies Inc,&#8221; by a majority vote of the shareholders. See Exhibit 3.3 &#8211; Certificate of Amendment for more details. 

&#160; 

Madison incorporated one wholly owned subsidiary named Scout Resources, Inc. to conduct Canadian exploration activities and to ensure that Madison was in compliance with local law that requires a domestic Canadian corporation to conduct local exploration activities. Both Madison and Scout Resources, Inc. will be referred to collectively as the &#8220;Company&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Madison maintains its statutory resident agent&#8217;s office at 1859 Whitney Mesa Drive, Henderson, Nevada, 89014 and its business office is located at 4448 Patterdale Drive, North Vancouver, BC, V7R 4L8. Madison&#8217;s office telephone number is (801) 326-0110. 

&#160; 

Madison has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 11,302,000 shares of Common Stock are currently issued and outstanding. 

&#160; 

Madison has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings. There has been no material reclassification, merger consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of Madison&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Business of Madison 

&#160; 

During the fiscal period ended December 31, 2013 Madison was engaged in the business mineral exploration. Madison&#8217;s principal business was the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. 

&#160; 

Subsequently, management decided to expand Madison&#8217;s focus and identify and assess new projects for acquisition purposes that are more global in nature and technology-based. 

&#160; 

CannaStrips Technology 

&#160; 

In April 2014 Madison entered into a letter of intent to acquire all the rights, title and interest in a cannabis delivery technology known as &#8216;CannaStrips&#8217; ( the Technology), including all intellectual property, equipment, and technology used in and related to the Technology, and including any related technology or related applications to be developed (collectively, the &#8220; CannaStrips Asset &#8221;). Madison had 30 days to complete its due diligence on the Technology. During that time period, Madison had the exclusive right to acquire the Technology on certain terms and conditions, including, among others, US$50,000 payable in 5 million restricted common shares of Madison at a deemed price of $0.01 per share. The 5 million restricted common shares will be issued within 30 business days of the signing of the Formal Agreement, see Exhibit 10.3 Letter of Intent dated April 17, 2014 for more details. 

&#160; 

On May 28, 2014 Madison&#8217;s, board of directors approved the asset purchase of the CannaStrips cannabis delivery technology. The board of director&#8217;s approval formally authorized the Company to close the CannaStrips Asset Purchase and acquire the CannaStrips technology and related intellectual property. The transaction formally closed on May 28, 2014.

&#160; 

&#160; 

At Closing the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of unregistered restricted Common Stock. In exchange the Company acquired the asset CannaStrips and all intellectual property related to the asset, see Exhibit 10.4 Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 28, 2014 for more details. 

&#160; 

After six months of further research and development of the technology the board determined that the present state of federal drug enforcement laws in the United States does not provide the legal framework for Madison to secure a market, develop further delivery mechanisms, or generate revenue from the technology without violating the current laws. 

&#160; 

On December 12, 2014 the board of Madison and Mr. Brent Inzer have mutually agreed to terminate the asset purchase agreement for the purchase of the technology known as &#8220;CannaStrips&#8221; and related intellectual property. 

&#160; 

As part of the asset purchase agreement, the board of directors had authorized the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of unregistered restricted Common Stock. Due to a cease trade order in British Columbia the board could not issue the authorized shares at that time. As of the date of the termination of the asset purchase agreement the 5,000,000 shares had not been issued and, as a result of the termination, will not be issued. See Current Report filed December 15, 2015 for more details. 

&#160; 

Plan of Operations 

&#160; 

Our plan of operation is to obtain debt and, or, equity finance to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There is can be no assurance that these events can be successfully completed. In particular there is no assurance that any such business will be located or that any stockholder will realize any return on their shares after such a transaction. Any merger or acquisition completed by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our current stockholders. We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. 

&#160; 

General Business Plan 

&#160; 

We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;). We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources. 

&#160; 

We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. We expect that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have, essentially no assets to provide the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering. 

&#160; 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our director, professional advisors or by our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Madison Technologies Inc. Form 10-K - 2015 Page 5 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters as 

&#160; 

&#160; (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (iii) history of operations, if any, and prospects for the future; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (v) quality, experience and depth of management services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (vii) specific risk factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (ix) potential for profit; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (x) public recognition and acceptance of products, services or trades; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (xi) name identification; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (xii) other factors that we consider relevant. &#160; 

As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. 

&#160; 

We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. 

&#160; 

Acquisition Opportunities 

&#160; 

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our current directors may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or our controlling shareholder may sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered a shell company. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop. 

&#160; 

While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called &#8220;tax-free&#8221; reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders. As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will: 

&#160; 

&#160; (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (ii) specify certain events of default; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company&#8217;s attorneys and accountants; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms. &#160; 

As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Controls and Regulations 

&#160; 

Currently, other than business and operations licenses applicable to most commercial ventures, Madison is not required to obtain any governmental approval for its business operations.

&#160; 

Madison currently has no costs to comply with environmental laws.
