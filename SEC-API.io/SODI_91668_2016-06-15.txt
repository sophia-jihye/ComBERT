The Company&#8217;s backlog at February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 and total sales for the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 reflect demand for the Company&#8217;s products at such dates and for such periods. For more information, see &#8220;Backlog&#8221; below. The variation in the proportionate share of each product line for each period reflects changes emanating from: demand, Congressional appropriations, the process and timing associated with awards of defense contracts, shifts in technology and consolidation of defense prime contractors. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s semiconductor products can be classified as active electronic components. Active electronic components are those that control and direct the flow of electrical current by means of a control signal such as a voltage or current. The Company&#8217;s active electronic components include bipolar transistors and MOS transistors. 

&#160; 

It is customary to subdivide active electronic components into those of a discrete nature and those which are non-discrete. Discrete devices contain one single semiconductor element; and non-discrete devices consist of integrated circuits or hybrid circuits, which contain two or more elements, either active or passive, interconnected to make up a selected complete electrical circuit. In the case of an integrated circuit, a number of active and passive elements are incorporated onto a single silicon chip. A hybrid circuit, on the other hand, is made up of a number of individual components that are mounted onto a suitable surface material, interconnected by various means, and suitably encapsulated. Hybrid and integrated circuits can either be analog or digital; presently, the Company manufactures only analog components. The Company&#8217;s products are either standard devices, such as catalog type items (e.g., transistors and voltage regulators), or application-specific devices, also referred to as custom or semi-custom products. The latter are designed and manufactured to meet a customer&#8217;s particular requirements. For the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, approximately 90% of the Company&#8217;s sales have been of custom products, and the remaining 10% have been of standard or catalog products. 

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Approximately 90% of the semiconductor components produced by the Company are manufactured pursuant to approved Source Control Drawings (SCD) from the United States government and/or its prime contractors; the remainder are primarily JAN qualified products approved for use by the military. The Company&#8217;s semiconductor products are used as components of military, commercial, and aerospace electronic equipment, such as ground and airborne radar systems, power distribution systems, missiles, missile control systems, and spacecraft. The Company&#8217;s products have been used on the space shuttle and on the spacecraft sent to the moon, to Jupiter (on Galileo), and to Mars (on Global Surveyor and Mars Sojourner). For the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, approximately 90% of the Company&#8217;s sales have been attributable to contracts with customers whose products are sold to the United States government. The remaining 10% of sales are for non-military, scientific and industrial applications. 

&#160; 

Custom products are typically sold to the United States government and defense or aerospace companies such as Raytheon Company, Lockheed Martin, Smith Industries, Harris Corporation, General Electric Aviation, and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, while standard products are sold to the same customer base and to the general electronic industry and incorporate such items as power supplies and other electronic control products. The Company has standard and custom products available in all of its major product lines. 

&#160; 

The following is a general description of the principal product lines manufactured by the Company. 

&#160; 

Power Transistors : 

&#160; 

Power transistors are high current and/or high voltage control devices commonly used for active gain applications in electronic circuits. The Company manufactures a large variety of power bipolar transistors for applications requiring currents in the range of 0.1A to 300A or voltages in the range of 30V to 1000V. The Company employs over 60 types of silicon chips to manufacture over 500 types of power bipolar transistors and is currently expanding this line in response to increased market demand resulting from other companies&#8217; departure from the military market. The Company also manufactures power diodes under the same military specification. Additionally, it manufactures power N-Channel and P-Channel MOSFET transistors and is continuously expanding that line in accordance with customers&#8217; requirements. The Company is qualified to deliver these products under MIL-PRF-19500 in accordance with JAN, JANTX and JANTXV. JAN, JANTX AND JANTXV denotes various quality military screening levels. The Company manufactures both standard and custom power transistors. 

&#160; 

The Company has been certified and qualified since 1968 under MIL-PRF-19500 (and its predecessor) standards promulgated by the Defense Supply Center Columbus (&#8220;DSCC&#8221;). These standards specify the uniformity and quality of bipolar transistors and diodes purchased for United States military programs. The purpose of the program is to standardize the documentation and testing for bipolar semiconductors for use in United States military and aerospace applications. Attainment of certification and/or qualification to MIL-PRF-19500 requirements is important since it is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to be selected to supply bipolar semiconductors for defense-related purposes. MIL-PRF-19500 establishes specific criteria for manufacturing construction techniques and materials used for bipolar semiconductors and assures that these types of devices will be manufactured under conditions that have been demonstrated to be capable of continuously producing highly reliable products. This program requires a manufacturer to demonstrate its products&#8217; performance capabilities. A manufacturer receives certification once its Product Quality Assurance Program Plan is reviewed and approved by DSCC. A manufacturer receives qualification once it has demonstrated that it can build and test a sample product in conformity with its certified Product Quality Assurance Program Plan. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of MIL-PRF-19500 qualification will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. The Company continues to expand its power transistor product offering. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Hybrids : 

&#160; 

Hybrids are compact electronic circuits that contain a selection of passive and active components mounted on printed substrates and encapsulated in appropriate packages. The Company manufactures thick film hybrids, which generally contain discrete semiconductor chips, integrated circuits, chip capacitors and thick film or thin film resistors. Most of the hybrids are of the high-power type and are custom manufactured for military and aerospace systems. Some of the Company&#8217;s hybrids include high power voltage regulators, power amplifiers, power drivers, boosters and controllers. The Company manufactures both standard and custom hybrids. 

&#160; 

The Company has been certified (since 1990) and qualified (since 1995) under MIL-PRF-38534 Class H (and its predecessor) standards promulgated by the DSCC. These standards specify the uniformity and quality of hybrid products purchased for United States military programs. The purpose of the program is to standardize the documentation and testing for hybrid microcircuits for use in United States military and aerospace applications. Attainment of certification and/or qualification under MIL-PRF-38534 Class H requirements is important since it is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to be selected to supply hybrids for defense-related purposes. MIL-PRF-38534 Class H establishes definite criteria for manufacturing construction techniques and materials used for hybrid microcircuits and assures that these types of devices will be manufactured under conditions that have been demonstrated to be capable of continuously producing highly reliable products. This program requires a manufacturer to demonstrate its products&#8217; performance capabilities. Certification is a prerequisite of qualification. A manufacturer receives certification once its Product Quality Assurance Program Plan is reviewed and approved by DSCC. A manufacturer receives qualification once it has demonstrated that it can build and test a sample product in conformity with its certified Product Quality Assurance Program Plan. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of MIL-PRF-38534 Class H qualification will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. 

&#160; 

Voltage Regulators: 

&#160; 

Voltage regulators provide the power required to activate electronic components such as the integrated circuits found in all electronic devices from radar and missile systems to smart phones. 

&#160; 

Power MOSFETs: 

&#160; 

Power MOSFETs perform the same function as bipolar transistors except that power MOSFETs are current controlled and bipolar transistors are voltage controlled. MOSFETs are popular due to their high input impedance, fast switching speed, and resistance to thermal runaway and secondary breakdown. Power MOSFETs are available in very high voltage and current ratings. 

&#160; 

Field Effect Transistors : 

&#160; 

Field effect transistors are surface-controlled devices where conduction of electrical current is controlled by the electrical potential applied to a capacitively coupled control element. The Company manufactures about 30 different types of junction and MOS field effect transistor chips. They are used to produce over 350 different field effect transistor types. Most of the Company&#8217;s field effect transistors conform to standard Joint Electronic Device Engineering Council designated transistors, commonly referred to as standard 2N number types. The Company continues to expand its field effect transistor product offering. The Company manufactures both standard and custom field effect transistors. 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURING 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s engineers design its transistors, diodes, field effect transistors and hybrids, as well as other customized products, based upon requirements established by customers, with the cooperation of the Company&#8217;s product and marketing personnel. The design of standard or catalog products is based on specific industry standards. 

&#160; 

Each new design is first produced on a CAD/CAE (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering) computer system. The design layout is then reduced to the desired micro size and transferred to silicon wafers in a series of steps that include photolithography, chemical or plasma etching, oxidation, diffusion and metallization. The wafers then go through a fabrication process. When the process is completed, each wafer contains a large number of silicon chips, each chip being a single transistor device or a single diode. The wafers are tested using a computerized test system prior to being separated into individual chips. The chips are then assembled in standard or custom packages, incorporated in hybrids or sold as chips to other companies. The chips are normally mounted inside a chosen package using eutectic, soft solder or epoxy die attach techniques, and then wire bonded to the package pins using gold or aluminum wires. Many of the packages are manufactured by the Company and, in most cases, the Company plates its packages with gold, nickel or other metals utilizing outside vendors to perform the plating operation. In the case of hybrids, design engineers formulate the circuit and layout designs. Ceramic substrates are then printed with thick film gold conductors to form the interconnect pattern and with thick film resistive inks to form the resistors of the designed circuit. Semiconductor chips, resistor chips, capacitor chips and inductors are then mounted on the substrates and sequential wire bonding is used to interconnect the various components to the printed substrate, as well as to connect the circuit to the external package pins. For the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, the Company manufactured approximately 20% of the hybrid packages it used and purchased the balance from suppliers. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to Company-performed testing and inspection procedures, certain of the Company&#8217;s products are subject to source inspections required by customers (including the United States Government). In such cases, designated inspectors are authorized to perform a detailed on-premise inspection of each individual device prior to encapsulation in a casing or before dispatch of the finished unit to ensure that the quality and performance of the product meets the prescribed specifications. 

&#160; 

ISO 9001:2008 

&#160; 

In March 2000, Underwriters Laboratories awarded the Company ISO 9001 qualification. The ISO 9001 Program is a series of quality management and assurance standards developed by a technical committee of the European Community Commission working under the International Organization for Standardization. During an annual surveillance audit performed in November 2013, the Company was subsequently qualified as meeting the new ISO 9001:2008 standard. 

&#160; 

AS9100 

&#160; 

In September 2009, Underwriters Laboratories awarded the Company AS9100 qualification. During annual surveillance audits performed in November 2013, and again in July 2015, the Company was re-certified. Companies in the aerospace industry are increasingly selecting suppliers on the basis of AS9100 certification. Achieving certified status means that the Company may obtain new business that may have been out of reach in the past and as obtaining such certification is now a requirement of several customers, we expect to maintain ongoing relationships with our existing aerospace customers long into the future. 

&#160; 

MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold throughout the United States and abroad directly to customers and through a network of manufacturers&#8217; representatives and distributors. The Company is represented (i) in the United States by five representative organizations that operate out of five different locations with 8 salespeople and two stocking distributor organizations that operate out of 12 locations and a third stocking distributor that operates out of 350 sales offices worldwide employing 2,700 people and (ii) in the international market by a representative organization in Israel with one salesperson. The Company also directly employs several sales, marketing, and application engineering personnel to coordinate operations with the representatives and distributors and to handle key accounts. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, the Company sold products to approximately 63 customers. Of these 63 customers, 28 had not purchased products from the Company during the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, Raytheon Company accounted for approximately 49% of net sales, as compared to the 48% it accounted for during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. During the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, sales to the United States Government accounted for approximately 13% of net sales, as compared to the 15% it accounted for during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. Raytheon Company, the United States Government, and Lockheed Martin are the only customers that accounted for more than 10% of net sales during the last fiscal year. Eighteen of the Company&#8217;s customers accounted for approximately 95% of the Company&#8217;s net sales during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. It has been the Company&#8217;s experience that a large percentage of its sales have been attributable to a relatively small number of customers in any particular period. Due to mergers and acquisitions activity in general, and among large defense contractors in particular, the number of large customers will most likely continue to decline in number, but this does not necessarily mean that the Company will experience a decline in sales. As a result, the Company expects customer concentration to continue. The loss of any major customer without offsetting orders from other sources could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Historically, during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 and prior to that date, a substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s products were sold pursuant to contracts, or subcontracts with or to customers whose end products are sold to the United States Government. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s sales may be adversely impacted by Congressional appropriations, changes in national defense policies and priorities and the continuing impact of the sequestration process that was triggered on March 1, 2013 which imposes automatic, across-the-board cuts to mandatory and discretionary federal spending over the next ten years. All of the Company&#8217;s contracts with the United States Government or its prime contractors contain provisions permitting termination at any time at the convenience of the United States Government or the prime contractor upon payment to the Company of costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. 

&#160; 

Although average sales prices are typically higher for products with military and space applications than for products with non-military, scientific and industrial applications, the Company hopes to minimize this differential by focusing on these quality-sensitive niche markets where price sensitivity is very low. There can be no assurance; however, that the Company will be successful in increasing its sales to these market segments, which increase in sales could be critical to the future success of the Company. To date, the Company has made only limited inroads in penetrating such markets. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company continues its efforts to identify a niche market for high-end industrial custom power modules and custom motor controllers where the Company&#8217;s capabilities can offer a technological advantage to customers in the motor driver, and power supplies industries. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this effort. To date, the Company has made only limited inroads in identifying such a market. The Company continues its effort to offer a solution to customers who seek alternative sources to bi-polar semiconductors that are discontinued by other manufacturers. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this effort. 

&#160; 

Sales to foreign customers, located mostly in Canada, Western Europe and Australia, accounted for approximately 8% of the Company&#8217;s net sales for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to 16% for the year ended February 28, 2015. All sales to foreign customers are conducted utilizing exclusively U.S. dollars . See Note 9 of the financial statements for more information regarding export sales to customers. 

&#160; 

BACKLOG 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s order backlog, which consists of semiconductor and hybrid related open orders, more than 97% of which is scheduled for delivery within 12 months, was approximately $5,832,000 at February 29, 2016, as compared to $7,176,000 at February 28, 2015. For the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, the entire backlog consisted of orders for electronic components. The Company currently anticipates that the majority of its open order backlog will be filled by February 28, 2017. In the event that bookings in the long-term decline significantly below the level experienced in the last fiscal year, the Company may be required to implement cost-cutting or other downsizing measures to continue its business operations. Such cost-cutting measures could inhibit future growth prospects. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Bookings and Backlog.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period because lead times for the release of purchase orders depend upon the scheduling practices of individual customers. The delivery times of new or non-standard products can be affected by scheduling factors and other manufacturing considerations, variances in the rate of booking new orders from month to month and the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations of orders. Also, delivery times of new or non-standard products are affected by the availability of raw material, scheduling factors, manufacturing considerations and customer delivery requirements. 

&#160; 

The rate of booking new orders varies significantly from month to month, mostly as a result of sharp fluctuations in the government budgeting and appropriation process. The Company has historically experienced somewhat decreased levels of bookings during the summer months, primarily as a result of such budgeting and appropriation activities. For these reasons, and because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations of orders, the Company&#8217;s backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Conditions &#8211; Result of Operations&#8221; for a discussion of the decrease in bookings for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to the previous year. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

PATENTS AND LICENSES 

&#160; 

The Company historically owned approximately 33 patents (all of which have now expired or have been allowed to lapse) relating to the design and manufacture of its products. The terminations of these patents have not had a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that engineering standards, manufacturing techniques and product reliability are more important to the successful manufacture and sale of its products than the expired or lapsed patents it held. 

&#160; 

FUTURE PLANS 

&#160; 

To increase liquidity, the Company plans to (a) continue improving operating efficiencies, (b) maintain or reduce overhead expenses, (c) develop alternative lower cost packaging technologies and lower cost packaging suppliers, (d) develop products utilizing its current manufacturing technologies geared toward market segments it is currently not serving on a significant level or at all, and (e) replace aging manufacturing equipment with new equipment. 

&#160; 

The Company also plans to continue its efforts in selling commercial semiconductors and power modules and to develop appropriate strategic alliance arrangements. If these plans are successful, the Company intends to aggressively pursue sales of these products which could require the Company to invest in the build up of inventories of finished goods and invest in capital equipment (assembly and test) to replace older generation equipment and to support new product manufacturing. Any financing necessary to fund these initiatives could come from equipment leasing, among other financing alternatives. Despite its intentions, the Company cannot assure you that any of the above described plans will be successful in increasing liquidity, reducing costs or improving sales. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The electronic component industry, in general, is highly competitive and has been characterized by price erosion, rapid technological changes and foreign competition. However, in the market segments in which the Company operates, while highly competitive and subject to the same price erosion, technological change is slow and minimal. The Company believes that it is well regarded by its customers in the segments of the market in which competition is dependent less on price and more on product reliability, performance and service. Management believes, however, that to the extent the Company&#8217;s business is targeted at the military and aerospace markets, where there has been virtually no foreign competition, it is subjected to less competition than manufacturers of commercial electronic components. Additionally, the decline in military orders in programs the Company participates in and the shift in the requirement of the Defense Department whereby the use of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components is encouraged over the use of high reliability components that the Company manufactures, prompting the number of competitors to decline, afford the Company the opportunity to increase its market share. In the non-military, non-aerospace markets, the Company is subject to greater price erosion and foreign competition. The Company continues its efforts to identify a niche market for high-end industrial custom power modules and custom motor controllers where the Company&#8217;s capabilities can offer a technological advantage to customers in the motor driver and power supplies industries. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this effort. The Company continues its effort to offer a solution to customers who seek alternative sources to bi-polar semiconductors that are discontinued by other manufacturers. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this effort. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company has numerous competitors across all of its product lines. The Company is not in direct competition with any other semiconductor manufacturer for an identical mixture of products; however, one or more of the major manufacturers of semiconductors manufactures some of the Company&#8217;s products. A few such major competitors (e.g., IXYS Corporation, Motorola Inc. (now On Semiconductors), Fairchild Semiconductor, among others) have elected to withdraw from the military market altogether. However, there is no assurance that the Company&#8217;s business will increase as a result of such withdrawals. Other competitors in the military market include International Rectifier (the Omnirel Division) now owned by Infinion Semiconductor, Microsemi Corporation (the NES and APT Divisions), M.S. Kennedy Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Anaren, Inc.), Natel Engineering Company and Sensitron Semiconductor. The Company competes principally on the basis of product quality, turn-around time, customer service and price. The Company believes that competition for sales of products that will ultimately be sold to the United States Government has intensified and will continue to intensify as United States defense spending on high reliability components continues to decrease and the Department of Defense pushes for implementation of its 1995 decision to purchase COTS standard products in lieu of products made in accordance with more stringent military specifications. The continuing impact of the sequestration process cannot be assessed at this time. However, indication from key customers is that they will be impacted by spending cuts and therefore it is likely that we will be impacted as well. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that its primary competitive advantage is its ability to produce high quality products as a result of its years of experience, its sophisticated technologies and its experienced staff. The Company believes that its ability to produce highly reliable custom hybrids in a short period of time will give it a strategic advantage in attempting to penetrate high-end commercial markets and in selling military products complementary with those currently sold, as doing so would enable the Company to produce products early in design and development cycles. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it will be able to improve its capability to respond more quickly to customer needs and deliver products ahead of schedule. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

At February 29, 2016, the Company had 75 employees, 48 of whom were engaged in production activities, 3 in sales and marketing, 6 in executive and administrative capacities and 18 in technical and support activities. Of the 75 employees, 72 were full time employees and 3 were part time employees. 

&#160; 

As part of a cost cutting strategy, effective as of November 2, 2015, exempt employees, who are paid a fixed weekly salary, had scheduled work hours reduced from 40 hours per week to 36 hours and their weekly salary was correspondingly reduced by 10%. For non-exempt employees, who are paid an hourly rate, the standard work schedule was reduced from 40 hours per week to 36 hours, with no change to the hourly rate. These reductions to scheduled work hours and salaries are still in effect. 

&#160; 

The Company has never had a work stoppage, and none of its employees are represented by a labor organization. The Company considers its employee relations to be good. 

&#160; 

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL 

&#160; 

The Company purchases its raw materials from multiple suppliers and has a minimum of two suppliers for most of its material requirements. A few of the key suppliers of raw materials and finished packages purchased by the Company, and their approximate percentage of total purchases, are: Egide USA Inc. (16%), Sintermetalglass S.R.L. (9%), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (8%), Wuxi Streamtek Ltd. (8%), and Stellar Industries (5%). Because of a diminishing number of sources for components and packages in particular, and the sharp increase in the prices of raw silicon semiconductor wafers, precious metals and gold (used in the finish of the packages), the Company has been obliged to pay higher prices, which consequently has increased costs of goods sold. Should a shortage of three-inch silicon wafers occur, we might not be able to obtain three-inch silicon wafers from any supplier or switch our manufacturing capabilities to another size wafer in time to meet our customer&#8217;s needs, leading to lost revenues. Most of the packages the Company uses are gold plated, thus they are subject to the volatility and cost fluctuations of gold. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

The Company has received DSCC approval to supply its products in accordance with MIL-PRF-19500 and Class H of MIL-PRF-38534. These qualifications are required to supply to the United States Government or its prime contractors. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of these qualifications will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. The Company is also certified in accordance with AS9100 which is a core requirement of most defense aerospace contracts. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

During the last two fiscal years, the Company has not spent a significant amount of its own funds on research and development. This may have an adverse effect on future operations. The cost of designing custom products is borne in full by the customer, either as a direct charge or is amortized in the unit price charged to the customer. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

While the Company believes that it has the environmental permits necessary to conduct its business and that its operations conform to current environmental regulations, increased public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations. The Company, in the conduct of its manufacturing operations, has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws and, therefore, is subject to regulations related to their use, storage, discharge and disposal. No assurance can be made that the risk of accidental release of such materials can be completely eliminated. In the event of a violation of environmental laws, the Company could be held liable for damages and the costs of remediation. In addition, the Company, along with the rest of the semiconductor industry, is subject to variable interpretations and governmental priorities concerning environmental laws and regulations.

Environmental statutes have been interpreted to provide for joint and several liability and strict liability regardless of actual fault. There can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will not be required to incur costs to comply with, or that the operations, business or financial condition of the Company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations.
