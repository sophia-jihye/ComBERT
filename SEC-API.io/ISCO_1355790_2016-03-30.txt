 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Business Overview 

International Stem Cell Corporation (sometimes referred to herein as &#8220;ISCO&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a biotechnology company focused on therapeutic and biomedical product development with multiple long-term therapeutic opportunities and two revenue-generating businesses offering potential for increased future revenue. 

We currently have no revenue generated from our principal operations in therapeutic and clinical product development through research and development efforts. We have generated revenue from our two commercial businesses, cosmetic and research products, of a total of $7.6 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Our products are based on multi-decade experience with human cell culture and a proprietary type of pluripotent stem cells, &#8220;human parthenogenetic stem cells&#8221; (&#8220;hpSCs&#8221;). Our hpSCs are comparable to human embryonic stem cells (&#8220;hESCs&#8221;) in that they have the potential to be differentiated into many different cells in the human body. However, the derivation of hpSCs does not require the use of fertilized eggs or the destruction of viable human embryos and also offers the potential for the creation of immune-matched cells and tissues that are less likely to be rejected following transplantation. ISCO scientists have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals with minimal immune rejection after transplantation. We have facilities and manufacturing processes that we believe comply with the requirements of current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards as defined by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations and promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). 

We are developing different cell types from our stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. We focus on applications where cell and tissue therapy is already proven but where there is an insufficient supply of functional cells or tissue. We believe that the most promising potential clinical applications of our technology are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Neural stem cells for treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and potentially other central nervous system disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Liver cells (&#8220;hepatocytes&#8221;) that may be used to treat a variety of congenital and acquired liver diseases. Using the same precursor cell that leads to liver cells, it is also possible to create islet cells for potential treatment of diabetes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Retinal cells and three-dimensional eye structures including corneal cells and tissue to treat degenerative retinal diseases, corneal blindness, and to accelerate corneal healing. 

We have completed our IND-enabling preclinical studies on our most advanced program, the development of neural stem cells for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and filed the regulatory submission to the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration (&#8220;TGA&#8221;) to start a phase 1/2a clinical trial in Australia. 

Each of these product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical development and may require specific unforeseen licensing rights obtained at substantial cost before regulatory approval may be achieved and the products sold for therapeutic use.

Additionally, we are subject to various other risks; for example, our business is at an early stage of development and we may not develop therapeutic products that can be commercialized; we have a history of operating losses, do not expect to be profitable in the near future and our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern; and we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain. Please see the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 12.

On December 16, 2014 we were named in Deloitte&#8217;s 2014 Technology Fast 500&#8482; of the fastest growing companies in North America. International Stem Cell Corporation was ranked in 215th place in the overall list, which also included the technology, media, telecommunications and clean tech companies. Of the 47 biotechnology businesses on the list, we placed 21st and we were the only regenerative medicine company represented 

Recent Development 

The Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia has recently cleared a regulatory submission from CytoTherapeutics, our wholly owned subsidiary, to initiate a Phase I/IIa clinical trial, dose escalation trial using human parthenogenetic stem cells-derived neural stem cells (ISC-hpNSC) in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson&#8217;s disease.

&#160;

&#160;

Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy 

Therapeutic Market &#8211; Clinical Applications of hpSCs for Disease Treatment 

Parkinson&#8217;s disease (&#8220;PD&#8221;) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and, according to the Parkinson Disease Foundation, there are more than one million sufferers in the United States and more than $2 billion is spent on medication. Currently there is no cure for PD and the improvements in symptoms provided by PD drugs often diminish with time. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating neural stem cells from hpSCs as a potential treatment of PD and potentially other central nervous system disorders in order to address this significant market opportunity.

Liver disease affects one in ten persons according to the American Liver Foundation, and is one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. There are more than 100 individual diseases of the liver; and, for people with liver failure the only effective treatment is full or partial organ transplantation. However, the demand for liver organs far exceeds the number available. According to the American Liver Foundation, over 16,000 individuals in the United States are waiting for a transplant. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating liver cells from hpSCs that may be used to treat a variety of hepatic and metabolic liver diseases to address this significant market opportunity. Importantly, liver cell transplantation has already been used in early stage clinical trials to treat patients with liver failure and has proven especially useful as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to keep patients alive until they can receive a whole liver transplant. 

Corneal blindness currently affects between seven and eight million people worldwide according to the World Health Organization, with a significant number of those people in India where cultural and other reasons inhibit the donation of corneal tissue. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating cornea-like structures from hpSCs. These clear hollow spheres are composed of tissue with a three-dimensional layered structure similar to what is found in normal corneal tissue. Portions or all of these tissue layers may be suitable for corneal transplantation in humans. In addition, corneal cells can be used for coating contact lenses to accelerate corneal healing. 

Diseases involving retinal degeneration include age-related macular degeneration (&#8220;AMD&#8221;) and retinitis pigmentosa (&#8220;RP&#8221;). These diseases are characterized by the death of critical photoreceptor cells called &#8220;rods&#8221; and &#8220;cones&#8221;. Photoreceptor death is due to an abnormality and/or to disruption or death of supportive cells called retinal pigment epithelial (&#8220;RPE&#8221;) cells. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1.8 million Americans aged 40 and over are affected by AMD.

Cosmetic Market &#8211; Skin Care Products 

Products that provide anti-aging benefits represent a significant portion of the global facial skincare market. In key regions, such as the U.S. and Asia, the growth of the facial care market is driven by increases in consumer disposable income and growing popularity of skincare products based on biotechnology, such as human stem cells. Currently this market segment is in its early stages of development and we believe it has a significant growth potential. Our goal is to leverage our leadership in human stem cell technology to develop and commercialize advanced anti-aging skincare products for our retail and professional channels. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifeline Skin Care, Inc. (&#8220;LSC&#8221;), develops, manufactures and markets a line of luxury skincare products with anti-aging benefits that is based on our proprietary stem cell extract and small molecule technologies. 

LSC&#8217;s products are sold in United States and internationally through a branded website, the professional channel (including dermatologists, plastic surgeons; medical, day and resort spas) and a network of international distributors. 

Biomedical Market &#8211; Primary Human Cell Research Products 

The global market for human cell systems for use in basic research is extremely large, with continuing anticipated growth. We believe that the following are the main drivers in the research market: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for experimental human cells which are more predictive of human biology than are non-human cells, genetically-modified cell lines or living non-human animals. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The emerging field of stem-cell-based regenerative medicine and the increase in associated grant money to study stem cells is driving the market not only for stem cell products but also for cell culture products in general. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The desire to lower the cost of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. We believe that human cell systems may provide a platform for screening toxic drugs early in the development process, thus avoiding late stage failures in clinical trials and reducing costs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to eliminate animal products in research reagents that may contaminate future therapeutic products. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for experimental control. Serum-free defined media provides the benefit of experimental control because there are fewer undefined components. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for consistency in experiments that can be given by quality controlled products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to eliminate in-house formulation of media, obtain human tissue or perform cell isolation. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to reduce animal testing in the consumer products industry. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary Lifeline Cell Technology, LLC (&#8220;LCT&#8221;) develops, manufactures and commercializes over 160 human cell culture products, including frozen human &#8220;primary&#8221; cells and the reagents (called &#8220;media&#8221;) needed to grow, maintain and differentiate the cells, in order to address this significant market opportunity. LCT&#8217;s scientists have used a technology called basal medium optimization to systematically produce optimized products designed to culture specific human cell types and to elicit specific cellular behaviors. These techniques also produce products that do not contain non-human animal proteins, a feature desirable to the research and therapeutic markets. 

Each LCT cell product is quality tested for the expression of specific markers (to assure the cells are the correct type), proliferation rate, viability, morphology and absence of pathogens. Each cell system also contains associated donor information and all informed consent requirements are strictly followed. 

While we have continued to expand our sales and marketing efforts in order to increase revenue, our commercial operations do not generate sufficient funds to fully support our core therapeutic and research efforts. Underpinning our research into the therapeutic properties of hpSC, we plan to expand our collection of parthenogenetic stem cell lines by creating and banking new clinical-grade hpSC lines at our Oceanside, California facility. We intend to create these new lines according to good tissue practices (&#8220;GTP&#8221;) and current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) and use them as sources for our own internal development programs and to generate revenue through licensing opportunities. We are actively working with a number of in vitro fertility (&#8220;IVF&#8221;) clinics in the southern California region enrolling individuals who are willing to donate oocytes for research purposes in order to create new hpSC lines.

Frequently Asked Questions 

What are Stem Cells? 

Cells are the basic living units that make up humans, animals, plants and other organisms. Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of cells. First, they can renew themselves for long periods of time. Second, they are unspecialized and under certain conditions can be induced to become cells with special functions such as metabolically active cells of the liver or transparent and protective cells of the eye. Until recently, scientists have worked with two major kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and adult stem cells that each has different properties and characteristics. ISCO has developed a third category of stem cells named parthenogenetic stem cells (the hpSCs mentioned above) that promise to have significant therapeutic advantages relative to these other types. 

What are Pluripotent Stem Cells? 

Pluripotent stem cells are able to be differentiated or developed into virtually any other cell made in an organism. Both embryonic and parthenogenetic stem cells are pluripotent. Some scientists are exploring manipulation of adult cells into a potentially pluripotent stage. This type of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells . 

&#160;

&#160;

What are Embryonic Stem Cells? 

Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos at an early stage of development, typically when they are in a structure of a small number of cells called the blastocyst. Embryonic stem cells are expanded in a laboratory cell culture process. Once cell lines are established, batches of them can be frozen and shipped to other laboratories for further culture and experimentation. 

What are Adult Stem Cells? 

An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell found among differentiated cells in a tissue or organ. An adult stem cell can renew itself (generally to a lesser degree than can embryonic or parthenogenetic stem cells) and differentiate to a limited number of specialized cell types. These cells can be isolated from different tissues such as the bone marrow, fat tissue, and umbilical cord blood. 

Why are Embryonic Stem Cells Important? 

Human embryonic stem cells are able to differentiate into virtually any other cell in the body and to reproduce themselves almost indefinitely. In theory, if stem cells can be grown and their development directed in culture, it would be possible to grow cells for the treatment of specific diseases. 

An early potential application of human embryonic stem cell technology may be in drug screening and toxicology testing. 

The study of human development may also benefit from embryonic stem cell research in that understanding the events that occur at the first stages of development has potential clinical significance for preventing or treating birth defects, infertility and pregnancy loss. The earliest stages of human development have been difficult or impossible to study. Human embryonic stem cells offer insights into developmental events that cannot be studied directly in humans or fully understood through the use of animal models. 

What are Parthenogenetic Stem Cells and how are they different? 

Parthenogenetic stem cells are pluripotent stem cells created from unfertilized human eggs through a &#8220;parthenogenesis&#8221; process. Parthenogenesis requires that an unfertilized human egg be &#8220;activated&#8221; by chemical, physical or other means. Activation results in a non-viable &#8220;parthenote&#8221; from which pluripotent parthenogenetic stem cell lines can be derived. The cell lines used by ISCO are human parthenogenetic stem cells. Currently International Stem Cell Corporation owns the largest published collection of human parthenogenetic stem cell lines. Our research is based on perfecting proprietary techniques for deriving stem cells through parthenogenesis that result in stem cell lines that have the same capacity to become all cells found in the human body, but do not require use or destruction of a viable human embryo. Furthermore, parthenogenetic stem cells can be produced in a simplified (&#8220;homozygous&#8221;) form that enables each line to be an immunological match for millions of people. We do not obtain stem cells from fetal tissue nor does our technology require the use of discarded frozen human embryos. 

Why Not Use Stem Cells Derived from Adults? 

There are several approaches now in human clinical trials that utilize adult stem cells. However, these cells have limited availability and limited ability to proliferate in culture as well as risk of genetic manipulation. Therefore, obtaining clinically significant amounts of adult stem cells may prove to be difficult. 

Why is Stem Cell Research Controversial? 

The sources of some types of stem cells cause social and religious controversy. For example, some scientists obtain stem cells from aborted fetal tissue, causing opposition from those opposed to abortion. Another controversial source of stem cells is residual human embryos (from fertilized human eggs) that remain after vitro fertilization procedures and are used to create embryonic stem cell lines. 

Is Stem Cell Research Banned in the US? 

Embryonic stem cell research, in general, is not banned in the US. Work by private organizations is not limited except by the restrictions applicable to all human research. In addition, Proposition 71 in California, which voters approved in November 2004, specifically allows state funds to be used for stem cell research. 

&#160;

&#160;

Why Not Use the Currently &#8220;Approved&#8221; Embryonic Stem Cells Lines? 

Most, if not all, human embryonic stem cell lines in research now have complex (&#8220;heterozygous&#8221;) immune compositions that are likely to cause the differentiated cells to be rejected by most patients. 

Why Not use Adult Cells Reprogrammed to become Pluripotent Cells? 

Induced pluripotent cells (&#8220;iPSs&#8221;) benefit from not being derived from human embryos but may face a number of other limitations such as uncertainty as to which genes are turned on and off. Furthermore, like embryonic stem cells, iPSs have complex (&#8220;heterozygous&#8221;) immune compositions that are likely to cause the differentiated cells to be rejected by most patients. 

Ethical Issues 

The use of embryonic stem cells derived from fertilized human eggs has created an ethical debate in the US and around the world. However, since no fertilized human eggs are used in creating our stem cells and no human embryo is being created, used or destroyed, we expect that our parthenogenetic stem cells will be more readily accepted in circumstances where there are ethical concerns with using traditional embryonic stem cells. 

We also have licensed worldwide rights to use a technology known as Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (&#8220;SCNT&#8221;) to create human stem cells. The President&#8217;s Council on Bioethics, as reported in the publication &#8220;Reproduction and Responsibility&#8212;The Regulation of New Biotechnologies 2004,&#8221; has agreed on a series of recommendations for the use of such technology. Countries such as the United Kingdom have made similar recommendations. 

Our Platform Technology 

We have developed a proprietary process based on parthenogenesis for the creation of a new type of stem cell that has shown to exhibit the pluripotency and proliferative benefits of embryonic stem cells yet avoid the use or destruction of fertilized human eggs or embryos. Furthermore, since parthenogenetic stem cells can be created with immunogenetically identical (&#8220;homozygous&#8221;) chromosome pairs, each line has potential to be an immune match for tens of millions of patients. If such cells were to be differentiated into functional mature cells they would, theoretically, be universally applicable across a wide range of medical conditions. 

We also hold licenses to three other technologies to create human pluripotent stem cells: SCNT technology (as mentioned previously); a technology that may be useful to create induced pluripotent stem cells (&#8220;iPS&#8221;); and &#8220;single blastomere technology&#8221; which uses a single cell obtained from a fertilized blastocyst to create an embryonic stem cell line. Each of these technologies has unique cell therapy applications and provides us with a broad base of technologies from which we can operate in the future. 

Our Facilities 

We have built the capacity to manufacture human cells for use in preclinical and clinical trials and ultimately for therapeutic use through the completion of our cGMP manufacturing laboratories in Oceanside, California and Frederick, Maryland, which is currently cGMP ready. The Oceanside laboratory is designed specifically for the derivation of clinical-grade parthenogenetic stem cell lines for our stem cell bank and their differentiated derivatives for future clinical trials. 

Our Products 

Therapeutic Product Candidates 

We are developing different cell types from our stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. We focus on applications where cell and tissue therapy is already proven but where there is an insufficient supply of functional cells or tissue. We believe that the most promising potential clinical applications of our technology are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Neural stem cells (ISC-hpNSC&#174;) for treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and potentially other neurological disorders, such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Liver cells (&#8220;hepatocytes&#8221;) that may be used to treat a variety of congenital and acquired liver diseases. Using the same precursor cell that leads to liver cells, it is also possible to create islet cells for potential treatment of diabetes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Three-dimensional eye structures to treat degenerative retinal diseases, corneal blindness, and to accelerate corneal healing. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our most advanced project is the neural stem cell program for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. In 2013 we published in Nature Scient ific Reports the basis for our patent on a new method of manufacturing neural stem cells which we intend to use to produce the clinical-grade cells necessary for future clinical studies and commercialization. 

In August 2014, we began evaluating the use of neural stem cell transplantation (&#8220;NSC&#8221;) for the treatment of ischemic stroke using a rodent model of the disease. Because, we have developed safety data on NSC from the Parkinson's disease program we believe can leverage such data in a program for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Each of these product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical development and may require specific unforeseen licensing rights obtained at substantial cost before any regulatory approval may be achieved and the products sold for therapeutic use.

Skin Care Products 

ISCO&#8217;s LSC subsidiary has developed four skincare products containing our proprietary stem cell extract that help combat the signs of aging. Daily Defense Complex is designed to facilitate quicker cell turnover and to restore skin&#8217;s natural moisture levels, and to prevent UV damage. Recovery Night Moisture Serum helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, increases skin firmness, and contributes to skin cell regeneration. Eye Firming Complex provides tightening benefits and reduces puffiness, while delivering hydration to soften lines and wrinkles. Neck Firming Serum is specifically designed to nourish and tighten the skin in the decollate area, visibly reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles. LSC has also developed three skin cleansing and exfoliating products that are intended to complement the active ingredients in the night, day, eye and neck products. Brightening Cleanser uses ultra-fine conditioning powders to help cleanse and brighten the skin. Dual Action Exfoliator uses glycolic acid and microcrystals to exfoliate dead skin cells and promote faster cell renewal. Refresh Polishing Gelee combines calming ingredients and micro beads to gently exfoliate the skin in preparation for application of the stem cell products. In December of 2015 LSC released its latest product &#8211; Molecular Renewal Serum, which provides a variety of skin brightening and anti-aging benefits without the side effects frequently associated with retinol containing skincare products. 

Research Products 

ISCO&#8217;s LCT subsidiary develops, manufactures and commercializes over 160 human cell culture products. These products include frozen human &#8220;primary&#8221; cells and stem cells and the reagents (called &#8220;media&#8221;) needed to grow, maintain and differentiate the cells. LCT&#8217;s scientists have used a technology called basal medium optimization to systematically produce optimized products designed to culture specific human cell types and to elicit specific cellular behaviors. These techniques also produce products that do not contain non-human animal proteins, a feature desirable to research and therapeutic markets. LCT frequently adds more products to its line. These human cell-based products are used domestically and internationally by research scientists in pharmaceutical, academic and government research organizations to study human disease and basic cell biology. LCT&#8217;s products eliminate the need for scientists to create their own cells, media and reagents or attempt to adapt &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; products to match specific experimental needs and they are superior to using animals or non-human animal cells as research tools because they are more relevant to the study of human disease. Strict quality assurance provides a high level of consistency and standardization of these products. LCT offers products that contain no animal products (&#8220;called &#8220;Xeno-free&#8221; products), allowing researchers to have better control of their experiments and to conduct research using products that ultimately can be more appropriate for therapeutic applications. 

Often LCT&#8217;s research customers use our cell-based research products in their clinical research, eventually adapting them for therapeutic applications. If one of our research products is adopted by a successful producer of therapeutic cells, ISCO may become a supplier to the much larger therapeutic market through LCT&#8217;s products. This is based on the fact that once regulatory product submissions are made to the FDA and similar authorities, the media and reagents used during development cannot be changed easily after approval. These uses of LCT&#8217;s products bring opportunities to ISCO for future therapeutic products. Such is the case with LCT&#8217;s Fibrolife &#174; media, which is currently being used in the process of creating tissue engineered vascular grafts. 

LCT products and applications include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Human skin cells and associated reagents (DermaLife &#174; ) for the study of skin disease, toxicology or wound healing. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Human cells from the heart and blood vessels and associated reagents (VascuLife &#174; ), used by researchers to study cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Human bronchial and tracheal cell lines for the study of toxicity, cystic fibrosis, asthma and pathogenesis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Human mammary epithelial cell lines for the study of breast cancer, three dimensional culture and carcinogen screening. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Adult stem cells (called mesenchymal stem cells) and the reagents necessary to differentiate them into various tissues, including bone, cartilage and fat. These products are valuable for researchers in the emerging field of regenerative medicine. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

An assortment of many other cell culture reagents and supplements for the growth, staining and freezing of human cells. 

Each LCT cell product is quality tested for the expression of specific markers (to assure the cells are the correct type), proliferation rate, viability, morphology and absence of pathogens. Each cell system also contains associated donor information and all informed consent requirements are strictly followed. 

LCT&#8217;s research products are marketed and sold by its internal sales force, OEM partners and LCT brand distributors in Europe and Asia. 

Our Markets 

Therapeutic Markets 

ISCO is currently pursuing a number of scientific development programs designed to lead to the creation of new therapeutic products. We anticipate that, with their superior immune-matching characteristics, our cells will be able to reduce or eliminate the need for immune-suppression drugs and the adverse reactions they trigger in patients. 

Parkinson&#8217;s disease . Parkinson&#8217;s disease (&#8220;PD&#8221;) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and, according to the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Foundation, there are more than one million sufferers in the United States and more than $2 billion is spent on medication. Currently there is no cure for PD and the improvements in symptoms provided by PD drugs often diminish with time. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating neural stem cells from hpSCs as a potential treatment of PD and potentially other central nervous system disorders in order to address this significant market opportunity. 

Liver disease . Liver disease affects one in ten persons according to the American Liver Foundation, and is one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. There are more than 100 individual diseases of the liver; and for people with liver failure, the only effective treatment is full or partial organ transplantation. However, the demand for liver organs far exceeds the number available. According to the American Liver Foundation, over 16,000 individuals in the United States are waiting for a transplant. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating liver cells from hpSCs that may be used to treat a variety of hepatic and metabolic liver diseases to address this significant market opportunity. Importantly, liver cell transplantation has already been used in early stage clinical trials to treat patients with liver failure and has proven especially useful as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to keep patients alive until they can receive a whole liver transplant. 

Corneal disease . Corneal blindness currently affects between seven and eight million people worldwide according to the World Health Organization, with a significant number of those people in India where cultural and other reasons inhibit the donation of corneal tissue. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating corneal-like structures from hpSCs. These clear hollow spheres are composed of tissue with a three-dimensional layered structure similar to what is found in normal corneal tissue. Portions or all of these tissue layers may be suitable for cornea transplantation in humans. In addition, corneal cells can be used for coating contact lenses to accelerate corneal healing. 

Retinal diseases . Diseases involving retinal degeneration include age-related macular degeneration (&#8220;AMD&#8221;) and retinitis pigmentosa (&#8220;RP&#8221;). These diseases are characterized by the death of critical photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Photoreceptor death is due to an abnormality and/or to disruption or death of supportive cells called retinal pigment epithelial (&#8220;RPE&#8221;) cells. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1.8 million Americans aged 40 and over are affected by AMD. 

Skin Care Market 

Skin care products play a key role in the daily healthcare routines of many consumers. Greater emphasis on advertising, broader and more integrated distribution networks, raising standards of living in emerging markets, and population aging trends in developed nations are the major factors driving the global demand for skin care products.

&#160;

&#160;

Global skin care market consists of (i) facial care products; (ii) body care products; and (iii) specialty needs products. Top selling products in the facial skincare cate gory include skin brighteners, anti-aging creams and serums, toners, masks, anti-acne and sun protection products. 

Facial skincare products that provide anti-aging benefits represent a significant portion of the global skincare market. Increased longevity leads consumers to seek out high quality, technologically advanced skincare products that can help them maintain a youthful appearance. Anti-aging products that are backed by scientific research remain in high demand among sophisticated consumers despite premium prices.

In response to consumer demand for superior quality skin care products, manufacturers are striving to innovate at all levels of the skincare market. Increasing emphasis is placed on discovery and testing of specialty compounds and technologies that provide a demonstrable cosmetic effect. Biotechnology-based skincare products are gaining increasingly higher market share as consumers discover their potential to deliver safe and effective results.

Research Market 

The research market for cell systems consists of scientists performing basic and applied research in the biological sciences. Basic research involves the study of cell biology and biochemical pathways. Applied research involves drug discovery, vaccine development, clinical research and cell transplantation. The domestic market can be broken into three segments: (i) academic researchers in universities and privately-funded research organizations; (ii) government institutions such as the National Institutes of Health, the US Army, the US Environmental Protection Agency and others; and (iii) industrial organizations such as pharmaceutical companies and consumer product companies. It is estimated that the combined academic and government markets comprise approximately 40% of the total market and that the industrial segment comprises approximately 60%. We believe the following are the main drivers in the research market for commercial cell systems: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for experimental human cells which are more predictive of human biology than are non-human cells or genetically-modified cell lines or living non-human animals.

&#183; 

The emerging field of stem-cell-based regenerative medicine and the increase in associated grant money to study stem cells is driving the market not only for stem cell products but also for cell culture products in general. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The desire to lower the cost of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. We believe that human cell systems may provide a platform for screening toxic drugs early in the development process, thus avoiding late stage failures in clinical trials and reducing costs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to eliminate animal products in research reagents that may contaminate future therapeutic products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for experimental control. Serum-free defined media provides the benefit of experimental control because there are fewer undefined components. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need for consistency in experiments that can be given by quality controlled products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to eliminate in-house formulation of media, obtain human tissue or perform cell isolation. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The need to reduce animal testing in the consumer products industry. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents 

In 2015, we were granted eight patents, covering different aspects and applications of our proprietary parthenogenetic technology. The first patent covers the use of fertilized human oocytes for the creation of human embryonic stem cell lines, and was issued in Great Britain. The second and third patents cover various aspects of pluripotent stem cell line creation and were issued in Japan and Korea respectively. The fourth patent protects various design and construction elements of specialized medium container that is currently used to package research products by ISCO&#8217;s subsidiary, Lifeline Cell Technology, and was issued in the United Sates. The fifth patent, also issued in Great Britain, covers various aspects of creating synthetic cornea tissues from retinal stem cells. The sixth, seventh, and eighth patent, issued in United States, Israel, and Japan respectively, cover the methods of deriving differentiated cells from stem cells. 

In addition to the eight patents covering in-house generated technology, two pending patent applications that were licensed by ISCO from Ocata Therapeutics (&#8220;Ocata&#8221;) were issued as patents. The first, issued in Australia, covers various screening assays for identifying differentiation-inducing agents. The second, issued in Israel, covers in vitro methods for reprogramming life span of recipient cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

We have pending patents covering homozygous parthenogenetic stem cells that can be immune matched to millions of person s and methods for deriving them. Other patents and pending patent applications include intellectual property concerning skin care formulations and methods of manufacturing stem-cell based skin care products and methods to differentiate stem cells. 

In addition, we have obtained exclusive worldwide licenses to patents and patent applications from Ocata Therapeutics (formerly Advanced Cell Technology). Our licensed and internally-generated patents provide the intellectual property rights we need to operate in the pluripotent stem cell field and to progress through the stages of creating a therapeutic stem cell product. These stages include the derivation, isolation, expansion and differentiation of stem cells. The intellectual property available to us enables us to create manufacturing methods that eliminate animal proteins in order to satisfy FDA requirements. In addition, we have rights to sell research products derived through our licensed intellectual property in order to generate income. 

The majority of the patents and applications have been filed in the US and in foreign countries through the Patent Corporation Treaty or by direct country filings in those jurisdictions deemed significant to our operations. Our currently issued patents will expire at various times commencing in 2020. 

We have protected our research products and branding through both patents and trademarks. Lifeline Skin Care has filed patent applications covering its proprietary formulations and methods of using stem cells and small molecules to create skin care products. ISCO, LCT, and LSC have registered trademarks on their company names, logos and various product names to protect their branding investment. Lifeline Cell Technology&#8217;s reagent formulations are protected as trade secrets. 

The patentability of human cells in countries throughout the world reflects widely differing governmental attitudes. In the US, hundreds of patents covering human embryonic stem cells have already been granted, including those on which we rely. Certain countries in Europe and Asia have taken the position that hES cells themselves are not patentable. ISCO believes that such restrictions are not appropriate as applied to parthenogenetic stem cells and is working with patent legislators in Europe to create exemptions for human parthenogenetic stem cells. As a result, we plan to file internationally wherever feasible and focus our research strategy on cells that best fit the US and foreign country definitions of patentable cells and technologies. 

On December 18, 2014 the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the European Union&#8217;s highest court ruled that the Company&#8217;s core technology patent applications are not covered by the prohibition on patenting embryonic stem cells, removing the final barrier to the approval of ISCO&#8217;s parthenogenetic stem cell patents in the European Union. This final and definitive ruling by the EU&#8217;s highest court now formally separates parthenogenetic stem cells from embryonic stem cells, and removes the exclusion from patentability on the former while maintaining the ban on the later.

License Agreements 

In May 2005, we entered into three exclusive license agreements (&#8220;ACT IP,&#8221; &#8220;Infigen IP,&#8221; and &#8220;UMass IP&#8221; or collectively &#8220;ACTC agreements&#8221;) with Ocata Therapeutics Inc. for the production of therapeutic products in the fields of diabetes, liver disease, retinal disease and the creation of research products in all fields. In February 2013, each of these license agreements was amended and restated, pursuant to which we continue to have rights to Ocata Therapeutics&#8217; human cell patent portfolio and non-exclusive rights to future developments in the area of diabetes and liver disease, as well as certain rights to patents covering Single Blastomere technology. A significant feature of the licensed Single Blastomere technology is a method of ethically obtaining human embryonic stem cells that allows us to isolate and differentiate hES stem cells directly from a &#8220;blastocyst&#8221; without harming the embryo. Using other licensed technology, the hES cells can be immediately differentiated into stem cells capable of expansion and differentiation into other types of cells. Under the terms of the amendments we have also acquired additional exclusive rights in the area of parthenogenesis and the use of parthenogenetically derived stem cells for treatment of human diseases. 

The agreements with Ocata Therapeutics further provide that we are no longer obligated to make milestone payments or to meet any minimum research and development requirements. We will no longer pay any royalties related to the ACT IP or Infigen IP, and our obligation to pay a minimum license fee for the UMass IP has been reduced to $75,000 annually, payable in two installments to Ocata Therapeutics. 

The agreements continue until the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights. Either party to each amended and restated license agreement may terminate the agreement for an uncured breach or we may terminate the agreements at any time with a 30 days written notice.

Research Agreements 

Our scientific founder, Elena Revazova, MD, PhD, has conducted basic research at the Scientific Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow, Russia. Through a research agreement, we have retained 

&#160;

&#160;

all intellectual property rights in the US and other major markets with respect to such research, while the Institute has retained such rights in Russia. 

In 2015 and 2014, ISCO spent $2.7 million and $5.4 million on research and development activities, respectively. ISCO actively pursues sponsored research agreements with local and international research organizations and has established research collaborations with collaborators from Duke University, Yale University, Tulane University, University of California, San Diego, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla), and the Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute. We are in frequent negotiations to develop collaborative research agreements with additional domestic and international research organizations from both the public and private sector. These agreements allow us to team up with nationally and internationally known research scientists to study stem cell technologies developed or licensed by ISCO for possible use in therapeutic or research fields. In addition to the research collaborations mentioned above, we provide our stem cell lines to researchers at many universities and other research facilities. Ordinarily, the stem cell lines are provided without charge, but we retain the right to either an exclusive or non-exclusive right to use any technology that may be developed that is necessary in order for us to make therapeutic products based on the research that uses our cells. 

&#160;

In 2014 the Company signed a research agreement with Rohto Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, (&#8220;Rohto&#8221;) the second-largest consumer health company in Japan, and a world leader in the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, skincare and healthcare products. Under the terms of the agreement, Rohto will evaluate stem cell-derived human cells owned and provided by ISCO in a number of pre-clinical animal models. In September 2015 the Company entered into the second phase of the existing Research Agreement with Rohto Pharmaceutical after Rohto acknowledged that ISCO's proprietary cells demonstrate consistent high quality and are suitable for further use in Rohto's research.

Competition 

The development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents for human disease is intensely competitive. Pharmaceutical companies currently offer a number of pharmaceutical products to treat Parkinson&#8217;s disease, diabetes, liver diseases, retinal disease, corneal disease and other diseases for which our technologies may be applicable. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same purposes, which may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases, or prevent their onset. We believe that our therapeutic products, when and if successfully developed, will compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. We believe that our most significant competitors will be fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. Smaller companies may also be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. 

Some of our primary competitors in the development of stem cell therapies are Stem Cells Inc.,BioTime, Neuralstem, Inc., ReNeuron, and ViaCyte. Our primary competitors in the skin care market are Obagi, Skinceuticals, SkinMedica (now owned by Allergan), and Murad. In the field of research products, our primary competitors for human cells, media and reagents are Lonza, EMD Millipore, Life Technologies (now owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific), StemCell Technologies, Zen-bio, PromoCell, and Specialty Media. In each of these areas many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and experience than we do. 

Sales and Marketing 

To date, sales of our research products have been derived primarily through our in-house sales force and via OEM and distribution contracts. Approximately 24% of our total sales in 2015 were from one customer. 

The skin care line was launched in November 2010 through the company&#8217;s own website&#8212;www.lifelineskincare.com. Since that time, distribution has expanded to include destination and resort spas, dermatologists, plastic surgeons and international markets. Domestically, we plan to increase distribution of our products by expanding our product line, increasing brand awareness, strategic partnerships, sales promotions, and public relations. Internationally, we are increasing distribution and sales through new distribution and custom product development agreements.

&#160;

&#160;

LCT&#8217;s research products are marketed and sold by its internal sales force, OEM partners and LCT brand distributors in Europe and Asia. 

Government Regulation 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed therapeutic and skin care products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products that may be developed by us. We anticipate that many, if not all, of our proposed therapeutic products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. 

We have made extensive progress in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals of research protocols, informed consent documents and donor protection procedures to obtain oocytes in the U.S. for the production of our parthenogenetic stem cell bank. These approvals include: federally mandated Institutional Review Board (IRB) and State of California required Stem Cell Research Oversight (SCRO) committee. 

Currently the U.S. government, though NIH appropriations restrictions, prohibits the use of federal funds in research involving parthenogenetic stem cells. Since we cannot receive federal funds for our stem cell research, we have decided to work with various foundations who are involved with stem cell research.

FDA Approval Process 

Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, pre-clinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to establish safety pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, possible dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing; and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. 

The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing on a non-biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies, the results of clinical trials are submitted as a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;). In responding to a NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or refuse to approve if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products. 

In November 2014, in an important ruling the FDA cleared ISCO&#8217;s human parthenogenetic stem cells line for investigational clinical use. This was a necessary step in the process of eventually advancing stem cell therapies based on ISCO&#8217;s core technology into clinical development. Although the Phase I trial for the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease program is anticipated to be conducted in Australia, and therefore not subject to FDA oversight, future studies will be carried out in the United States where this approval is necessary. 

European and Other Regulatory Approval 

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities 

&#160;

&#160;

in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), Australia and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countrie s varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensin g. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries. 

In Australia, the approval process for commencing Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials resides with both Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the Human Research Ethics Committee, (HREC). Prior to commencing a clinical trial, a sponsor must submit to TGA a CTX application and must submit to the HREC a study protocol, an investigator brochure and a template informed consent for such clinical trial. The HREC approval process generally takes four to eight weeks.

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the treatment of oocyte donors, the manufacturing environment under which human cells for therapy are derived, safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action. 

Other Regulations for Lifeline Skin Care 

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FFDCA&#8221;) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (&#8220;FPLA&#8221;) provide the regulatory framework for selling cosmetics. The FFDCA oversees the safety of cosmetics. The FPLA ensures that the labeling is not false or misleading and includes all relevant information in a prominent and conspicuous manner. 

Safety and efficacy testing of the products is performed by independent third party testing organization. 

Employees 

In addition to our four executive officers, we utilize the services of 37 full-time staff members.
