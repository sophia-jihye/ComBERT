 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

ServiceSource International, Inc. (NASDAQ: SREV) is the global leader in customer and revenue lifecycle solutions that power enterprise revenue relationships. Based on the science of Revenue Lifecycle Management (RLM), ServiceSource provides some of the world&#8217;s leading business to business (B2B) companies with expert, technology-enabled services and solutions that are proven to grow and retain revenue from existing customers, directly or through a channel. With a holistic approach to managing the entire revenue lifecycle (which includes onboarding, client success, quoting, up-sell, cross-sell, warranty services and renewals), ServiceSource solutions help companies drive improved customer adoption, expansion and retention for our B2B clients. 

Our solutions are comprised of a unique and precise mix of managed services, a purpose-built RLM technology platform, and best-practice processes developed over more than 15 years of exclusive focus on revenue retention, revenue growth, and client success. With the experience of nearly $8.4 billion in recurring revenue sold in 2015 and global 

deployments across 40 languages and 150 countries, ServiceSource solutions can uniquely leverage industry and company data, leading-edge technology and best-practices drawn from our significant and in-depth database of renewal benchmarks. By integrating managed services, cloud software and data, we provide our clients with insights into their end customers&#8217; businesses, end-to-end management and optimization of end customer onboarding, adoption, subscription, asset management, and service contract renewal processes whether managed by us directly or through our client&#8217;s channel partners. 

Our managed services business leverages either a pay-for-performance or a flat-rate model whereby our clients pay us a commission based on renewal sales that we generate on their behalf. Our cloud software technologies are an integral component to our unique RLM technology platform and may be managed by ServiceSource or provided directly to the client. Such cloud technologies include: ServiceSource Revenue Analytics, Renew OnDemand and the ServiceSource Customer Success application, all of which automate and provide data driven insights into these highly valuable but typically manual business processes. This blend of technology capabilities, managed services and best-practice process can drive higher subscription, maintenance and support revenue while improving end customer retention and increasing business predictability. 

In 2015 we managed approximately $9.9 billion &#32;of Opportunity Under Management for our clients. Opportunity Under Management is a non-GAAP metric that represents our estimate of the value of all end customer service contracts that we had the opportunity to sell on behalf of our clients over a designated period of time. In addition, we processed more than $4.0 billion of contract value through our cloud technologies in 2015 for which we received fees. As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately 154 &#32;engagements across 78 &#32;clients. Also in 2015 we sold $8.4 billion of recurring revenue on behalf of our clients, which we refer to as bookings and is a non-GAAP metric. Our total revenue was $252.2 million , $272.2 million &#32;and $272.5 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. For summarized financial information by geographic area, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The scalability of our solution enables us to sell in over 40 languages from six centers around the globe. Our solution is designed to optimize recurring revenue across different revenue models, distribution models, and segments, including hardware, software, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), industrial systems, information and media, as well as technology-enabled health care and life sciences.

Our Solutions 

&#160; 

Our solutions are based on more than 15 years of experience pioneering solutions in the Revenue Lifecycle category and are offered via managed services as well as the cloud. We believe this dual approach is critical to addressing the unique requirements of effective recurring revenue management and customer success. 

&#160; 

Our suite of managed services includes customer success, onboarding, activation, enablement and selling services, in which dedicated service teams with specific expertise in our clients&#8217; businesses are deployed under our clients&#8217; brands and follow a sales process tailored specifically to improve end customer retention and increase service contract renewals. 

The components of our cloud solution consist of a suite of managed services and cloud technologies, and include ServiceSource Revenue Analytics, Renew OnDemand and ServiceSource Customer Success. The ServiceSource Customer Success application, which was introduced in October 2014, leverages the capabilities of our ServiceSource Revenue Analytics platform. Our cloud technologies increase the visibility and control of recurring revenue streams and customer success data, and are utilized by clients, their channel partners, end customers and our service sales teams. 

Managed Services Offerings 

ServiceSource leverages deep experience, analytical expertise, high-performance sales teams and unique technology to drive customer success and renewals through our managed services. With our dedicated sales or channel sales teams, who are highly trained in selling the value of renewable products and services, our clients consistently see improved end customer adoption and retention, higher cross-sell and upsell, lower churn rates and, ultimately, greater recurring revenue. 

Our managed services leverages our knowledge base across the following critical business processes: 

&#8226; 

Service Performance Analysis . During the Service Performance Analysis (SPA) process, we conduct interviews with our prospective clients, analyze their historical performance and future opportunity, and evaluate their recurring revenue business using a number of metrics. We also use our breadth of experience to benchmark and identify service renewal opportunities, and to calculate our ability to improve our clients' performance based on our performance with similar types of businesses and revenue streams. 

&#8226; 

Business Case, Pricing and Contract Structuring . We utilize our reservoir of data and benchmarks to estimate the critical components of the business case and appropriate pricing model for prospective clients. This intelligence is fundamental to our pay-for-performance business model. 

&#8226; 

Recurring Revenue Performance . Once a partnership is in place with one of our clients, we leverage our data warehouse to enable, measure, analyze, benchmark and optimize the performance of our service sales teams. 

&#8226; 

Client Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement . Our extensive platform and the accumulation of more than 15 years of experience serve as the foundation for benchmarking our clients&#8217; evolving recurring revenue and end customer success performance against industry peers and previous period performance. We generally conduct quarterly business review meetings and annual partnership reviews with our clients to review performance, identify potential weaknesses in their processes and determine opportunities for improvement, and make recommendations that we believe will allow our clients and us to achieve higher levels of performance and efficiencies. 

&#8226; 

Developing and Delivering Applications . Our data warehouse fuels the opportunity data, sales methodologies, metrics, and reporting dashboards that we engineer into our applications. Accordingly, we design our applications to leverage the transactional, analytical and industry data housed in our platform. 

For our selling services, we employ service sales personnel that interact directly with end customers to sell service renewals or provide other customer success services that deepen our client's relationship with their end customer. They also provide active sales enablement, support and management of channel partners. Our service sales teams act as an extension of our clients&#8217; brands. 

We have developed a set of service delivery best-practices that includes role specialization for selling, enablement, and data service. We believe that role specialization is a key component in driving higher recurring revenue rates. We offer a package of managed services for each of these specialized roles, and our clients can choose to purchase individual solutions or a full pay-for-performance solution. They include renewal selling services, up-sell and cross-sell services, enablement and quoting services, warranty services, customer success services and onboarding services. 

Cloud Technologies 

We provide a suite of cloud technologies uniquely designed to help companies drive revenue growth and customer success from their existing end customers throughout the Revenue Lifecycle. Our cloud technologies are purpose-built to address the challenges of B2B customer success, account management, and recurring revenue renewals. Our technologies include: 

ServiceSource Revenue Analytics 

ServiceSource Revenue Analytics is a Revenue Lifecycle management platform that helps subscription based businesses execute cost-effective processes across onboarding and adoption, up-sell and cross-sell, retention and renewals throughout the entire Revenue Lifecycle. ServiceSource Revenue Analytics, correlates product usage, billing and customer revenue management (CRM) data with success plans to proactively trigger intelligent workflow automations, and helps companies engage the right end customer with the right play at the right time. 

Renew OnDemand 

Renew OnDemand is a cloud application that helps clients increase recurring revenue and profitability, improve retention and gain unique business insights. Renew OnDemand provides clients with a unified view of their data from diverse sources and leverages a data warehouse of transactional, analytical, and industry information to offer a comparative view of our clients' results against their industry peers. 

ServiceSource Customer Success 

ServiceSource Customer Success is a best-practices driven customer success management solution, powered by account, user and subscription level predictive analytics, outcomes based success plans, closed loop reporting and revenue advisory services. The solution enables our client to profile a successful end customer journey, deliver actionable insight into end customer health and retention risks, prioritize accounts based on business goals and user behavior, and recommend next best actions for each end customer at every stage of the customer lifecycle. ServiceSource Customer Success ensures that best-practice onboarding, adoption and retention processes are applied. 

Our cloud technologies are hosted at third party data centers where we employ rigorous technologies, policies and procedures to protect client and end customer data. 

Key benefits of our managed services and cloud solutions include: 

Financial Benefits 

&#8226; 

Increased recurring revenue. &#32;Our solution is designed to increase recurring revenues for our clients. Each client engagement begins with a SPA, which is an in-depth analysis of current renewal rates. We actively monitor the contract renewal rates we drive on behalf of our clients in each engagement. When we generate higher renewal rates, we not only drive incremental revenue for the associated period, but also have a compounding effect in increasing the base number of contracts eligible for renewal in subsequent periods, which expands the opportunity to generate greater revenue in future periods. 

&#8226; 

Improved retention and customer success. &#32;Our solutions drive end customer retention and revenue growth for some of the world&#8217;s leading companies, leveraging more than 15 years of expertise to continuously monitor end customer health, engage each end customer with the right play at the right time and reinforce the unique value and benefits of each end customer&#8217;s product. The result is reduced end customer churn, increased revenue through up-sell and cross-sell, stronger end customer relationships and higher satisfaction. 

&#8226; 

Increased margin and profitability. &#32;We believe that the costs associated with delivering maintenance, support and subscription services by many of our clients can be relatively fixed, and thus growth of these recurring revenue streams can benefit our clients&#8217; profitability. In addition, clients that deploy our solution can avoid infrastructure expenditures and personnel costs that would otherwise be associated with managing renewals internally. As a result, each incremental dollar of recurring revenue generated by our solution can drive greater profitability for our clients. 

Operational Benefits 

&#8226; 

Greater business insight and analytics. &#32;The analytics engines in our cloud technologies allow us to analyze each client&#8217;s renewals and churn rates against similar transactions, identifying areas for improvement and enabling greater insight into their business. All transactions, regardless of outcome, are recorded in our platform. We leverage this platform to provide benchmarking, end customer metrics, sales efficiency data, and insight into successful and unsuccessful renewal efforts. The breadth of our data allows us to provide powerful analysis across regions, industries, channel partners, and product segments. 

&#8226; 

Greater visibility and forecasting tools. &#32;Our cloud technologies deliver real-time analytics and visibility into our client&#8217;s recurring revenue performance, sales efficiency and forecasts. We measure recurring revenue performance across dozens of key performance indicators and provide real-time data to our clients through a clear and impactful web-based interface. Chief Financial Officers and other executives rely on our applications to assist in forecasting their results and to measure progress against their forecasts on a real-time basis. 

&#8226; 

Global consistency. &#32;We are able to maintain a globally consistent customer success and revenue growth selling process for our clients. Our global sales centers operate from a unified platform. Our cloud technologies automate the application of best-practices to recurring revenue renewals and customer success processes, and provide all relevant constituencies with a consistent view of the data. This automation facilitates contract renewals and provides reliable performance management and analytics. 

Our Strategy 

We intend to continue our industry leadership by delivering solutions to support the challenges faced by our clients in managing their revenue lifecycle. Our strategy to execute this vision is: 

&#8226; 

Expand our client base within existing industry verticals . In the last two years we have expanded our list of target industries. We currently have 78 &#32;clients and believe there are over 900 companies in our addressable market. 

&#8226; 

Increase footprint with existing clients to drive greater revenue per client . Our goal is to manage a greater portion of each client&#8217;s recurring revenue. We have increasingly taken on the management of more than just one component of a client&#8217;s recurring revenue, such as a specific product, market segment or geographic region. Because we baseline our clients&#8217; performance prior to any engagement, we are able to quantify our results for the client, which frequently leads to increased opportunities to expand our Opportunity Under Management for that client, and ultimately generating greater revenue for ourselves. 

&#8226; 

Continue to expand our suite of cloud technologies. &#32;We have developed our cloud technologies to increase our client's sales efficiency and automate tasks associated with client success and recurring revenue management. By continuing to invest in our cloud technologies, automation processes, and the innovation of our technology platform, we can uncover new revenue opportunities, lower operating costs, increase the efficiency of our solutions, and enhance our profitability and cash flow. 

Customers 

We sell our solutions to B2B companies, which we refer to as our clients, within a range of industries such as computer hardware, software, SaaS, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences, media and industrial systems. In 2015 we managed approximately $9.9 billion &#32;of Opportunity Under Management for our clients and sold $8.4 billion of recurring revenue on behalf of our clients. In addition, we processed more than $4.0 billion of contract value through our cloud technologies in 2015 for which we received fees. As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately 154 &#32;engagements across 78 &#32;clients. 

Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 57% , 51% and 50% of our revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. No single client represented 10% or more of our revenues in 2015. One client represented 12% &#32;and 14% &#32;of our revenue in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our solutions through our global sales organization. Our sales representatives are organized by geographic regions: North America and Latin America (NALA), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific-Japan (APJ). We deploy quota-carrying sales and solution design professionals to target specific regions and industry verticals. 

We generate client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target sales, services, customer success, account management, technology and finance executives within the computer hardware, software, SaaS, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences, media and industrial systems industries. Our marketing teams and programs are organized by geography and industry segment to focus on the unique needs of clients within the specific target markets. 

We participate in industry trade shows and host local and regional events around the world to stimulate industry dialog on revenue lifecycle management and to promote our cloud technologies and managed services. 

We are actively involved in the Service Executive Industry Board (&#8220;SEIB&#8221;), an independent industry board we founded to share best-practices and address issues impacting the industry. The board members consist of 24 senior executives, including two of our executives, who manage and grow recurring revenue at leading technology based hardware, software, and health 

care companies. SEIB meets twice a year to establish industry standards and best-practices for benchmarking and measuring the health of global maintenance, support and recurring revenue and customer satisfaction. 

Research and Development 

We focus our research and development efforts on enhancing our cloud technologies and managed services as well as creating complementary new capabilities to add to our proprietary solution. Our development strategy is to identify features, business intelligence, applications and other technology elements that are, or are expected to be, needed by sales professionals, customer success and account management professionals, clients, channel partners and end customers to optimize recurring revenue performance and customer success. We are also continuing to invest in the development of our cloud technologies to serve our clients&#8217; needs and enable greater operational efficiencies in our organization. 

&#160; 

Our research and development expenses were $16.5 million &#32;in 2015 , $25.8 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $23.9 million &#32;in 2013 . In addition, we capitalized certain expenditures related to the development and enhancement of internal-use software in 2015 &#32;and 2014. We did not capitalize any expenditures in 2013. 

Competition 

The market for recurring revenue management is evolving. Historically, technology companies have managed their service renewals through internal personnel and relied upon a variety of technologies including spreadsheets, internally developed software and customized versions of traditional business intelligence tools and end customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software from vendors such as Oracle Corporation, SAP AG, salesforce.com, inc. and NetSuite, Inc. Some companies have made further investments in this area using firms such as Accenture, Plc. and McKinsey &#38; Company, Inc. for technology consulting and education services focused on service renewals. These internally developed solutions represent the primary alternative to our integrated approach of combining software, managed services and data to provide end-to-end optimized recurring revenue performance. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following: 

&#8226; 

recurring revenue and customer success industry expertise, best-practices, and benchmarks; 

&#8226; 

ability to increase recurring revenue and renewal rates; 

&#8226; 

global capabilities; 

&#8226; 

completeness of solution; 

&#8226; 

performance-based pricing of solutions; 

&#8226; 

ability to effectively represent client brands to end customers and channel partners; 

&#8226; 

quality of the business and client insight and its ability to generate revenue and customer success; 

&#8226; 

size of upfront investment; and 

&#8226; 

size and financial stability of operations. 

With respect to our cloud technologies, we are seeing competition from companies targeting product usage, renewals and customer success related technologies. Although we believe we compete or compare favorably with respect to many of these factors and currently have few direct competitors that offer integrated solutions at our scale, we expect competition and competitive pressure, from both new and existing competitors, to increase in the future. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely upon a combination of copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks, in addition to contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We currently have one registered copyright in the United States, nine issued patents in the United States, sixteen pending patent applications in the United States, one pending international patent application, and eight national phase patent applications pending in four foreign patent offices (two applications in each of Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan). This summary includes patents obtained from our acquisition of Scout Analytics, Inc. We also have registered trademarks for &#8220;ServiceSource&#8221; in the United States, the European Community, Japan, Singapore and Australia. In addition, we have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications for a number of product names in various jurisdictions. 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology and/or brand names to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. The laws of other countries in which we market our solutions may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies equivalent or superior 

to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products incorporating those technologies. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it, which would significantly harm our business. 

We expect that technology solutions in our industry may be increasingly subject to third-party patent infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Such competitors could make a claim alleging that we infringe one or more of their patents, and we do not own any patents, which could be asserted against them. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents upon which our current solution or future technology infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 2,745 &#32;employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with us.
