 Item 1. Business 

We are a leading provider of cloud-based enterprise work management software. We define enterprise work management software as software applications that enable organizations to plan, manage and execute projects and work. Our applications are easy-to-use, highly scalable and offer real-time collaboration for knowledge workers distributed on a local or global scale. Our applications address enterprise work challenges in the following categories: 

&#8226; 

Project and Information Technology (IT) Financial Management . Enables customers to manage their organization&#8217;s projects, professional workforce and IT costs. 

&#8226; 

Workflow Automation . Enables customers to automate document-intensive workflows among internal functional areas as well as with their partners and supply chain. 

&#8226; 

Digital Engagement . Enables customers to effectively engage with their customers, prospects and community via the web and mobile technologies. 

We sell our software applications primarily through a direct sales organization comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel. In addition to our direct sales organization, we have an indirect sales organization, which sells to distributors and value-added resellers. We employ a land-and-expand go-to-market strategy. After we demonstrate the value of an initial application to an organization, our sales and account management teams work to expand the adoption of that initial application across the organization, and cross-sell additional applications to address other enterprise work management needs of the organization. Our customer success organization supports our direct sales efforts by managing the post-sale customer lifecycle. 

Our subscription agreements are typically sold either on a per-seat basis or on a minimum contracted volume basis with overage fees billed in arrears, depending on the application being sold. We service customers ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to small- and medium-sized businesses. We have more than 2,000 &#32;customers with over 235,000 &#32;users across a broad range of industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, education, consumer goods, media, telecommunications, government, food and beverage, healthcare and life sciences. 

We have achieved significant growth and scale in a relatively short period of time. Through a series of acquisitions, we have established a diverse family of software applications under the Upland brand, each of which addresses a specific enterprise work management need. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 , our total revenue grew from $64.6 million &#32;to $69.9 million , representing an 8% &#32;period-over-period growth rate. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by $8.3 million, or 13%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 , our subscription and support revenue grew from $48.6 million &#32;to $57.2 million , representing an 18% &#32;period-over-period growth rate. On a constant currency basis, subscription and support revenue increased by $11.0 million, or 23%. See Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our revenue as it relates to domestic and foreign operations. 

Our operating results in a given period can fluctuate based on the mix of subscription and support, perpetual license and professional services revenue. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our subscription and support revenue accounted for 82% &#32;and 75% &#32;of total revenue, respectively. Our customer agreements for program and portfolio management, project management and collaboration, and professional services automation typically are sold on a per-seat basis with terms varying from one to three years, paid in advance. Our customer agreements for workflow automation and enterprise content management and financial management historically have been sold on a volume basis with a one-year term, paid in advance. We generally seek to enter into multi-year contracts with our customers when possible. In each case, our customer agreements provide us with revenue visibility over a number of quarters. We typically negotiate the total number of seats or total minimum contracted volume a customer is entitled to use as part of its subscription, but these seats or minimum contracted volume may not be fully utilized over the term of the agreement. In addition, where customers exceed the minimum contracted volume, additional overage fees are billed in arrears. 

Historically, we have sold certain of our applications under perpetual licenses, which also are paid in advance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our perpetual license revenue accounted for 4% &#32;and 4% &#32;of total revenue, respectively. We expect perpetual license revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future. The support agreements related to our perpetual licenses are one-year in duration and entitle the customer to 

support and unspecified upgrades. The revenue related to such support agreements is included as part of our subscription and support revenue. 

Professional services revenue consists of fees related to implementation, data extraction, integration and configuration and training on our applications. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our professional services revenue accounted for 14% &#32;and 21% &#32;of total revenue, respectively. We expect professional services revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods due to customer expansion initiatives which have driven more focus on expanding existing customer recurring revenue and less focus on new customer professional service projects. 

We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, and renew agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each calendar year as our customers tend to follow budgeting cycles at the end of the calendar year. Our cash flow from operations has historically been higher in the first quarter of each calendar year than in other quarters. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we defer revenue recognition. In addition, seasonality may be difficult to observe in our financial results during periods in which we acquire businesses as such results typically are most significantly impacted by such acquisitions. We expect this seasonality to continue, or possibly increase in the future, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics. 

To support continued growth, we intend to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses to enhance the features and functionalities of our applications, expand our customer base and provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. We will prioritize acquisitions within the enterprise functions we currently serve, including information technology, process excellence, finance, professional services and marketing, as well as pursue acquisitions that serve other enterprise functions. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have made a total of nine acquisitions in the four years ending December 31, 2015 . 

We completed our initial public offering in November 2014 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol &#8220;UPLD.&#8221; 

Industry Background 

A Rapidly Changing Business Environment 

The continued growth of an information-based economy driven by technological innovation and globalization is causing a fundamental change in the business environment and the way work is done. To be successful, organizations must be able to quickly adapt to changes in this complex and rapidly evolving environment and optimize the utilization of their people, time and money. These changes have given rise to a large and growing group of knowledge workers who operate in dynamic work settings as part of geographically dispersed and virtual teams. To be successful, these knowledge workers must quickly synthesize, analyze and act on large amounts of information and collaborate effectively at any time, from anywhere and on any device. 

Legacy Processes and Systems are Insufficient 

Many organizations continue to utilize manual processes and traditional tools, such as paper-based techniques, spreadsheets and email, as well as legacy on-premise enterprise systems, to manage knowledge work. The limitations of these processes and systems include siloed and disparate information, limited visibility and transparency, poor collaboration among teams, lost productivity and misalignment of work efforts and overall business objectives. In addition, legacy on-premise enterprise systems can be expensive and time intensive to implement, inflexible and difficult to use, and costly to upgrade and maintain. Today, legacy processes and systems are being disrupted and replaced by cloud-based enterprise work management software that improves visibility, collaboration and productivity. 

The Impact of Cloud-Based Enterprise Work Management Software 

Enterprise work management software is an emerging category of software applications that enable organizations to effectively plan, manage and execute projects and work in order to maximize work capacity, productivity and profitability. Recently, cloud computing and SaaS have begun to transform enterprise work management with rapid speed-to-value, low total cost of ownership and reduced financial risk. As a result of these benefits, the annual growth rate of the SaaS market is expected to be significantly greater than the worldwide application software market. 

The enterprise-grade applications market is growing at an accelerated rate. According to IDC, the market for enterprise applications is expected to reach $201.7 billion by 2019, representing a 6.6% CAGR. IDC estimates that the worldwide demand for public cloud will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.6% by 2019. Comparatively, the worldwide on-premise application software market will grow at a CAGR of 3.9%. By 2019, IDC postulates cloud-based software will have a significant business impact, driving growth and accounting for at least $1 of every $4.59 spent on software-as-a-service.We believe the ability of cloud-based software to deliver a flexible, scalable, cost-efficient, easy-to-use and collaborative platform to knowledge workers distributed on a local or global scale will significantly accelerate the adoption of cloud-based enterprise work management software applications. 

Cloud-based enterprise work management software applications can increase work capacity, productivity and profitability by reducing manual processes and isolated silos of information, and by enhancing collaboration across organizations. While cloud-based enterprise work management software applications may be adopted on an individual basis, we believe they deliver the greatest value when multiple applications are deployed, as an end-to- end management process for prioritizing, allocating, managing and monitoring resources and work throughout the enterprise. We provide a diverse offering of software applications that address a broad range of enterprise work management needs. 

We currently participate in various areas of enterprise work management, including the markets that IDC identifies as worldwide project and portfolio management, worldwide business process management software, worldwide financial performance and strategy management applications, worldwide collaborative applications and worldwide content management software. Within these markets our family of cloud-based software applications address enterprise work functions in program and portfolio management, project management and collaboration, workflow automation and enterprise content management, professional services automation and financial management. While these markets today are largely served by legacy on-premise enterprise systems, we believe there will continue to be increased market adoption of cloud-based enterprise work management software applications. 

The Upland Approach 

Our software applications are designed for the way people work today. Unlike legacy solutions, our applications have been developed with the unique requirements of today&#8217;s knowledge worker in mind.

Our Competitive Strengths 

The following competitive strengths are keys to our success: 

&#8226; 

Large, attractive customer base . Our customer base is highly diverse and spans a broad array of industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, education, consumer goods, media, telecommunications, government, food and beverage, healthcare and life sciences. We service customers of varying size, ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to small- and medium-sized businesses. We have a highly referenceable customer base that we leverage to help us acquire new customers. We have over 2,000 &#32;customers, with no customer accounting for more than 3% &#32;of our revenue. 

&#8226; 

Diversified family of software applications . We offer a family of software applications that addresses a broad range of enterprise work management needs, from strategic planning to task execution. We believe this benefits our customers as compared to many of our cloud-based competitors who offer only a single point solution for a more limited and discrete work management need. Our applications address the information technology, process excellence, finance, professional services and marketing functions within organizations. 

&#8226; 

Recurring revenue model with high visibility . We believe we have a highly attractive operating model due to the recurring nature of our subscription revenue, which results in greater visibility and predictability of future revenue and enhances our ability to effectively manage our business. In addition, the cloud-based nature of our model accommodates significant additional business volume with limited incremental costs, providing us with opportunities to improve our operating margins. 

&#8226; 

Proven M&#38;A capability . We have a proven ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses to grow our company, as evidenced by the eleven acquisitions we have completed since the beginning of 2012. We have a dedicated and experienced corporate development team that continually monitors hundreds of companies in order to maintain a robust pipeline of potential acquisition candidates. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy gives us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our family of software applications to better serve our customers. 

&#8226; 

Experienced, proven management team . Our management team has significant operating experience and previously occupied key leadership roles at both private and public companies. In addition, our management&#8217;s extensive knowledge of the industry and experience in building businesses organically and through strategic acquisitions has enabled us to quickly establish a leading position within the enterprise work management software market. 

&#8226; 

Cloud-based platform . We deliver our software applications and functionality primarily through the cloud, with no hardware or software installation required by our customers. This delivery model allows us to provide reliable, cost-effective applications to our customers, add subscribers with minimal incremental expense and deploy new functionality and upgrades quickly and efficiently. We believe our cloud-based delivery model provides us with a competitive advantage over legacy processes and on-premise systems. 

&#8226; 

Commitment to customer success . We have a dedicated customer success organization whose mission is to drive adoption, value realization, retention and loyalty across our customer base. Our focus on enabling our customers&#8217; success is a key reason our annual net dollar retention rate was 90% &#32;in fiscal 2015 . Our commitment to customer success has enabled us to expand our footprint within organizations and facilitate the ongoing adoption of our enterprise work management software applications. 

Our Strategy for Growth 

Our objective is to be the world&#8217;s leading provider of enterprise work management software. The key elements of our strategy for growth are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Increase sales to existing customers . We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the adoption of our applications within existing customers, particularly within divisions or departments that have not previously used our applications. We also intend to cross-sell additional applications to our existing customers, as very few of our customers currently use more than one of our applications. In addition, we intend to add new applications to our family of applications that will address additional functions within the enterprise work management spectrum. We believe these initiatives will significantly increase the value of our platform to our customers, further strengthen our competitive position and drive increased adoption of multiple applications by our customers. 

&#8226; 

Add new customers . We maintain direct sales and marketing capabilities in order to further grow our customer base. We also maintain indirect sales channels through alliances with strategic partners that can leverage our applications with complementary services and technologies they provide. In addition, we continue to expand the range of integrations between our software and third-party applications and platforms, which we believe make our applications more attractive to a broader audience of potential customers. 

&#8226; 

Acquire complementary software businesses . We intend to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses to enhance the features and functionality of our applications, expand our customer base and provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. Our dedicated and experienced corporate development team continually monitors hundreds of companies in order to maintain a robust pipeline of potential acquisition candidates, many of which are smaller scale or address only limited enterprise work management challenges, which often operate outside the scope of some of our larger competitors. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy gives us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our family of cloud-based applications to better serve our customers. We will prioritize acquisitions within the enterprise functions we currently serve, including Project &#38; IT Management, Workflow Automation and Digital Engagement. 

&#8226; 

Expand globally . We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow sales of our applications globally. In fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 19% , 22% &#32;and 24% , respectively, of our revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Over the next several years, we will continue to evaluate growth opportunities outside the United States through selective acquisitions, the hiring of additional sales personnel and entering into strategic partnerships. 

&#8226; 

Improve and enhance applications . We will continue to invest in research and development and work closely with our customers to identify and improve new applications, features and functionalities that address customer requirements across the enterprise work management spectrum. We also intend to continue to expand the breadth of our applications with additional analytics, third-party integrations and social and mobile capabilities to meet the evolving needs of today&#8217;s knowledge workers.

Conference attendees also gain insight into our recent application enhancements and participate in interactive sessions that give them the opportunity to express opinions on new features and functionality. 

&#8226; 

Professional Services . Our professional services team is responsible for coordinating all activities relating to the implementation, transition and on-boarding of new customers and assisting new customers with the addition of new applications to their accounts. Typical professional services engagements vary in length from a few weeks to several months depending on the size and scope of the engagement and are in addition to services provided under our standard customer agreement and are fee-based. In addition, our project managers and consultants work closely with our customers to provide services that help customers maximize the utility of our applications. Our continuing education services, known as Upland University, provide our clients with access to product tutorials and information on new applications and platform features, as well as offer tailored training programs to meet specific client needs. 

&#8226; 

Account Management . We assign each customer a regionally aligned account team with a relationship manager who functions as the customer&#8217;s single point of contact and advocate within Upland. Our account management teams are trained on all of our applications and work closely with the relationship manager to ensure that our customers receive high-quality consultative service. 

&#8226; 

Customer Support . We offer support from all of our office locations, as well as our offshore Center of Excellence in Egypt and India, to help our customers maximize the return on their investment in our applications. We provide 24/7 customer support around the world through our online customer support portal. In addition, our customer support team manages and administers the Upland customer community forum and knowledge base repository.

We use storage area network hardware at our data center locations that has been designed for high performance and data-loss prevention. We believe these systems have the capability and scalability to enable us to meet our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future. 

We employ a modular application architecture to balance customer workloads across multiple servers and to provide a flexible method for scaling customers without impacting other parts of the server environment. This architecture is designed to allow us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our customers. We employ capacity planning techniques to ensure we have required capacity for our forecasted growth. 

We offer high levels of security by segregating each customer&#8217;s data from the data of other customers and by limiting access to our platform to only those individuals authorized by our customers. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. We strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. Periodic security audits are conducted by an external third-party and include firewall penetration testing and vulnerability scans. In addition, sensitive customer data is encrypted. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to a redundant server storage device in a secondary data center. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems, and advanced fire and flood prevention. 

All users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our system. Users must have a valid user ID and associated password to log onto our user interface. Our configurable security model allows different groups of users to have different levels of access to our applications. Security groups and policies are 

delivered or can be created based on a customer&#8217;s unique access requirements. 

We currently serve our customers from secure, third-party, American National Standards Institute Tier 3 data center facilities, located in the United States and other countries. Our data centers are designed to host computer systems with fully redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. While we procure and operate all infrastructure equipment delivering our applications, third parties operate the data centers that we use. These facilities provide 24/7 security, biometric access controls, systems security, redundant networking, N+1 power and environmental controls. Our contracts with these third party data center providers are typically for a term of three years. While we believe that these data centers have sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future, we have instituted a new initiative to consolidate our data centers for higher efficiency. 

We voluntarily obtain third-party security examinations relating to security and data privacy in accordance with the Service Organization Control (SOC) and Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization. Our SOC examination is conducted every year by an independent third-party auditor and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures and logical security procedures. 

Research and Development 

We focus our research and development efforts on customer-driven innovation, third-party integrations and continually enhancing the performance, reliability, security, usability, and scalability of our applications. 

In addition to internal resources, we utilize partners, contractors and offshore resources to improve efficiencies and our ability to deliver. Our research and development expenses were $15.8 million , $26.2 million , $10.3 million &#32;in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See audited financial statement Note 17 &#32; Related Party Transactions &#32;regarding an $11.2 million charge to research and development costs in fiscal 2014. 

Competition 

The overall market for enterprise work management software is rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our range of enterprise work management applications. We believe there are a limited number of direct competitors that provide a comprehensive cloud-based enterprise work management software offering. However, we face competition both from point solution providers, including legacy on-premise enterprise systems, and other cloud-based work management software vendors that may address one or more of the functional elements of our applications, but are not designed to address a broad range of enterprise work management needs. In addition, we face competition from manual processes and traditional tools, such as paper-based techniques, spreadsheets and email. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 

&#8226; 

breadth and depth of application functionality; 

&#8226; 

ease of deployment and use of applications; 

&#8226; 

total cost of ownership; 

&#8226; 

levels of customer support satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

brand awareness and reputation; 

&#8226; 

capability for configurability, integration, scalability and reliability of applications; 

&#8226; 

ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and 

&#8226; 

level of integration among applications and with other enterprise systems. 

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will 

largely depend on the strength of our applications, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer success organization and our ability to acquire complementary technologies, products and businesses to enhance the features and functionality of our applications. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 342 &#32;employees, with the majority of our employees being located in the United States or Canada. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe would, individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
