 Item 1. Business 

General 

IRIDEX Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of therapeutic based laser consoles, delivery devices and consumable instrumentation used to treat sight-threatening eye diseases in ophthalmology. In February 2012, we sold our aesthetics business to Cutera, Inc. The sale of the aesthetics business was a significant step forward in our strategy because it allowed us to focus solely on our ophthalmology business which is our core strength. Our ophthalmology products are sold in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors. Total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $41.8 million, $42.8 million and $38.3 million, respectively. We generated net income of $0.5 million, $10.0 million and $2.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net income for 2014 included a $1.3 million expense for the adjustment in our earn-out liability on prior acquisitions and a credit to income tax expense of $8.8 million for the release of our deferred tax valuation allowance. 

Our ophthalmology products consist of laser consoles, delivery devices and consumable instrumentation including laser probes, and are used in the treatment of serious eye diseases, including the three leading causes of irreversible blindness: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (&#8220;AMD&#8221;). In addition, our ophthalmology products are often used in vitrectomy procedures (used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments) which are generally performed in the operating room and require a consumable single use intraocular laser probe (&#8220;EndoProbe&#8221;) to deliver light energy to the back of the eye together with other instrumentation. Our ophthalmology business includes (i) a recurring revenue component, consisting of sales of consumable products, predominantly single use laser probe devices and other instrumentation, combined with the repair, servicing and extended service contracts for our laser systems; and (ii) a capital component, consisting of the laser consoles combined with durable delivery devices (laser systems). 

Our laser consoles consist of our recently introduced Cyclo G6 laser system, IQ products which include IQ 532 and IQ 577 laser photocoagulation systems; and our OcuLight products including OcuLight TX, OcuLight SL, OcuLight SLx, OcuLight GL and OcuLight GLx laser photocoagulation systems. Certain of our laser consoles are capable of performing traditional continuous wavelength photocoagulation and our patented Fovea-Friendly MicroPulse laser photocoagulation. Towards the end of 2012, we introduced the TxCell Scanning Laser Delivery System, a delivery device which saves significant time in a variety of laser photocoagulation procedures by allowing physicians to deliver the laser in a multi-spot scanning mode, a more efficient method for these procedures than the traditional single spot mode. Our current family of laser probes includes a wide variety of products in 20, 23, 25 and 27 gauge for vitreoretinal surgery along with our recently patented MicroPulse P3 (&#8220;MP3&#8221;) and G-Probe for glaucoma surgery. 

Ophthalmologists typically use our laser systems in hospital operating rooms (&#8220;OR&#8221;) and ambulatory surgical centers (&#8220;ASCs&#8221;) , as well as their offices and clinics. In the OR and ASC&#8217;s , ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indire ct laser ophthalmoscope or a consumable, single use EndoProbe , MP3 or G-Probe . Since our first shipment in 1990, approximately 12,500 medical laser systems manufactured by IRIDEX have been sold worldwide. 

IRIDEX Corporation was incorporated in California in February 1989 as IRIS Medical Instruments, Inc. In November 1995, we changed our name to IRIDEX Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware. Our executive offices are located at 1212 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, California 94043-1824, and our telephone number is (650) 940-4700. We can also be reached at our website at www.IRIDEX.com, however, the information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;IRIDEX,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to IRIDEX Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and when the context so requires, our wholly owned non-operating subsidiaries, IRIS Medical Instruments, Inc. and Light Solutions Corporation, each a California corporation, and IRIDEX France SARL. 

Market 

Ophthalmology is a large and growing global market. Growth is driven by the aging world population and the onset of diabetes, which is occurring at an epidemic rate, the introduction of new treatment approaches, and the realities of constrained health care system spending. 

Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes which impairs vision over time and if left untreated can lead to blindness. Laser photocoagulation is currently the standard treatment for this disease, although there has been increased use of pharmaceuticals in recent years. A single treatment of continuous wavelength laser photocoagulation has been shown to stabilize the patient&#8217;s vision over the long term. Continuous wavelength laser photocoagulation treatments typically take several months to be fully effective and have been demonstrated to last for many years. This treatment presents a very cost efficient model, and presents a risk of varying degrees of vision loss to the patient. Pharmaceuticals can stabilize vision in the near term, as treatments typically take a few days to be fully effective and have been demonstrated to last for weeks. However, patients receiving pharmaceutical treatment for diabetic retinopathy require repeated injections. The injections are painful and the patients may experience side effects including increased risk of eye infections. Furthermore, a regimen of repeated injections is very costly to both the physician, in terms of time, and to the healthcare system, in terms of dollars spent on treatment. The short comings in treating this disease have led to a renewed interest in alternative approaches that may provide better patient outcomes. 

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the world. Currently, glaucoma is not curable, and vision loss resulting from glaucoma currently cannot be regained. Glaucoma is often chronic and must be monitored for the duration of the patient&#8217;s life. Most cases of glaucoma can be controlled and vision loss slowed or halted by treatment. Pharmaceuticals are typically the first treatment method prescribed for glaucoma. These pharmaceutical treatments are commonly self-administered in drop form by the patients. Patients often have difficulties applying the pharmaceutical drops properly and may fail to appropriately or timely apply the medication, which may significantly reduce the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical. Even when administered correctly, pharmaceuticals have demonstrated reduced efficacy over time. When pharmaceuticals lose their effectiveness, laser treatment is often performed, and ultimately surgery may be required. The short comings in treating this disease have led to a renewed interest in surgical approaches that may allow treatment earlier and may result in better patient outcomes. 

AMD is a disease that affects the aged. Although pharmaceuticals are used to delay vision loss, there is currently no cure for AMD. Pharmaceuticals require repeated injections in the eye every six to eight weeks, which are painful, increase the risk of adverse side effects, are costly, and their long term viability is unproven. Continuous wavelength laser photocoagulation can also be used to treat AMD, although it is used less frequently because the disease often requires the laser to be applied to the area of the retina responsible for central vision and the likelihood of significant loss of visual function is too high. The short comings in treating this disease has led to a renewed interest in investigating alternative approaches that might allow treatment earlier which would result in better patient outcomes. 

Laser Photocoagulation 

We produce laser photocoagulator systems, which are used in the treatment of many sight-threatening eye diseases, the majority of which are diseases of the retina and glaucoma. Photocoagulation delivers laser light to carefully targeted eye tissue and generates a local healing response. Laser photocoagulation has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapy with long-term benefits. 

The traditional method of performing laser photocoagulation uses a mode which delivers continuously-on laser light, which is referred to as continuous wave (&#8220;CW&#8221;) mode. Use of this mode typically leads to local tissue damage under the belief that tissue damage was necessary to generate the beneficial response associated with laser photocoagulation and can cause loss of visual function. 

MicroPulse 

MicroPulse is a method of delivering laser energy using a mode which chops the CW beam into short, microsecond long, laser pulses, which we have developed. There is a growing body of clinical evidence that demonstrates that MicroPulse therapy can generate the beneficial response associated with CW laser photocoagulation with no detectible tissue damage for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and AMD. When used to treat diabetic retinopathy we refer to this as Fovea-Friendly because the laser can be used to treat the fovea without any loss of visual function typically associated with CW laser photocoagulation. Our IQ products are capable of MicroPulse as well as CW laser photocoagulation.

The IRIDEX Strategy 

We are one of the worldwide leaders in developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and servicing innovative medical laser systems and associated instrumentation for the treatment of the sight-threatening eye diseases mentioned above. With the sale of our aesthetics business we are now focused exclusively on our ophthalmology business. At the end of 2015, we had $10.0 million in cash and no debt. Other than in 2012, when we incurred a net loss of $0.2 million from our ophthalmology operations, we generated net income from our ophthalmology operations in each of the past six years. It is our goal to continue to operate our business profitably. 

Our strategy is to leverage our existing brand and distribution channel in the ophthalmology market to promote the adoption of MicroPulse as a viable treatment alternative for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and AMD and consequently to introduce a broad array of products that: 

&#160;

1. 

Improve therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from sight-threatening eye diseases; 

&#160;

2. 

Improve the efficiency of physicians and reduce their costs; and 

&#160;

3. 

Provide economic benefits to healthcare systems. 

To achieve these goals we are pursuing a number of organic initiatives which we anticipate will be supplemented from time to time by acquisitions. We anticipate that the successful execution of this strategy will lead to profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value. 

Ophthalmic Products 

We utilize a systems approach to product design. Each system includes a console, which generates the laser energy, and a number of interchangeable peripheral delivery devices for use in specific clinical applications. This approach allows our customers to purchase a basic console system and add additional delivery devices as their needs expand or as new applications develop. We believe that this systems approach is our distinguishing characteristic and also brings economies-of-scale to our product development and manufacturing efforts because individual applications do not require the design and manufacture of complete stand-alone products. Our primary capital equipment products range in price from $1,000 to $60,000 and consist of laser consoles and specialized durable delivery devices. Our line of consumable products range in price from $10 to $250 and consist primarily of cannulas and laser probes. 

Consoles 

Our laser consoles, which are identified below, incorporate the economic and technical benefits of solid state and semiconductor laser technology. 

Cyclo G6 Glaucoma Laser System. The newest addition to the Iridex console portfolio, the Cyclo G6 is an 810nm, infrared laser designed to treat patients diagnosed with a range of glaucoma disease states. The product received FDA approval in January 2015, and commenced commercial sales in March 2015. Unlike Iridex&#8217;s other consoles, the Cyclo G6 system is sold with a family of probes that are single-use, including our patented MP3 disposable probe that utilizes our MicroPulse technology. We believe that the Cyclo G6 laser, when used with the MP3 probe, has several important competitive advantages over alternative therapies with respect to invasiveness, repeatability, safety, patient recovery time and cost effectiveness. The Cyclo G6 console weighs 8.5 pounds, has dimensions of 7.8&#8221;H x 10.6&#8221;W x 11.6&#8221;D and includes SmartProbe RFID connector technology with laser parameter memory. 

Visible (Yellow) Photocoagulator Console. Our IQ 577 delivers visible (Yellow &#8211; 577nm) laser light. This product utilizes state of the art user interface technology and delivers a 577 wavelength which is at the peak of oxyhemoglobin absorption and allows ophthalmologists to obtain optimal results with lower power (more tissue sparing) compared with green wavelengths. The IQ 577 console weighs 18 pounds, has dimensions of 7.5&#8221;H x 12&#8221;W x 14&#8221;D, draws a maximum of 250 Watts of wall power, requires no water cooling, and has a remote control and wireless footswitch. 

Visible (Green) Photocoagulator Console. Our IQ 532 , OcuLight TX, GL and GLx Photocoagulators deliver visible (Green &#8211; 532nm) laser light. The IQ 532 product utilizes a user int erface and product platform based on the IQ 577, as more fully described above . The OcuLight TX/GL/GLx have dimensions of 6&#8221;H x 12&#8221;W x 12&#8221;D, draw a maximum of 300 Watts of wall power and require no water cooling. 

Infrared Photocoagulator Consoles. Our OcuLight photocoagulator consoles deliver infrared laser light and is available with output power ranges of 2 Watts (OcuLight SL) or of 3 Watts (OcuLight SLx). The OcuLight consoles weigh 14 pounds and have dimensions of 4&#8221;H x 12&#8221;W x 12&#8221;D and does not require external air or water cooling. 

MicroPulse Enabled Consoles . MicroPulse mode is offered as an option on our IQ 577, IQ 532 and some of our infrared laser photocoagulator systems. 

Multi-wavelength Laser System Configurations . When used in conjunction with specific IRIDEX laser consoles, our Symphony slit lamp adapters can deliver multiple laser wavelengths from a single slit lamp installation. Our laser consoles, together with our Symphony slit lamp adapters, combine the clinical versatility and convenience of multiple wavelength delivery into one delivery device for retinal and glaucoma procedures. Currently, our compatible consoles are the OcuLight GLx and the OcuLight TX green laser consoles and the OcuLight SLx and the IQ 577 yellow laser consoles. 

Ophthalmic Delivery Devices and Other Products 

Our versatile family of consoles and delivery devices has been designed to accommodate the addition of new capabilities with a minimal incremental investment. Typically users of our consoles can add capabilities by simply purchasing new interchangeable delivery devices and utilizing them with their existing console. We have developed both consumable and durable delivery devices and expect to continue to develop additional delivery devices. 

MicroPulse P3 Probe. The MP3 Probe is the primary delivery device used in the cyclophotocoagulation procedure to treat various stages of glaucoma. The MP3 Probe utilizes Iridex&#8217;s patented MicroPulse technology, and can be performed on an anesthetized eye in the doctor&#8217;s office or OR. The non-invasive procedure takes just a few minutes (varies based on physician settings) and results in minimal discomfort and post-operative recovery for the patient. The procedure maybe used to treat a wide variety of glaucoma states, including earlier-stages, and is particularly useful for patients who may find it difficult to undergo traditional surgery. Although still a relatively new procedure, we believe that the use of the Cyclo G6 laser with an MP3 probe has been highly successful in reducing intraocular pressure (&#8220;IOP&#8221;) and allowing patients to reduce the number of daily eye drops. 

TxCell Scanning Laser Delivery System (&#8220;TxCell&#8221;). TxCell was introduced in the second half of 2012. It allows the physician to perform multi-spot pattern scanning for efficient retinal photocoagulation, confluent laser patterns for tissue-sparing MicroPulse protocols and allows for standard single spot photocoagulation. A second version was introduced at the end of 2013 that worked with a wider variety of slit lamps existing in the market and included a number of enhanced features. 

TruFocus Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (&#8220;LIO&#8221;). The indirect ophthalmoscope is designed to be worn on the physician&#8217;s head and to be used in procedures to treat peripheral retinal disorders, particularly in infants or adults requiring treatment in the supine position. This product can be used in both diagnosis and treatment procedures at the point-of-care. 

Slit Lamp Adapter (&#8220;SLA&#8221;). These adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard slit lamp in both diagnosis and treatment procedures. Physicians can install an SLA in a few minutes and convert standard diagnostic slit lamps into a therapeutic photocoagulator delivery system. SLAs are used in treatment procedures for both retinal diseases and glaucoma. These devices are available in a wide variety of spot diameters. Our standard SLAs have a single fiber and deliver laser light from a single laser console. Our Symphony SLA has multiple fibers and can deliver laser light from two compatible laser consoles. 

Operating Microscope Adapter (&#8220;OMA&#8221;). These adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard operating microscope in both diagnosis and laser treatment procedures. These devices are similar to SLAs, except that they are oriented horizontally and therefore can be used to deliver retinal photocoagulation to a supine patient. 

EndoProbe. Our EndoProbe fiber optic delivery devices are used for endophotocoagulation, a retinal treatment procedure performed in the hospital OR or surgery center during a vitrectomy procedure. These sterile disposable probes are available in tapered, angled, stepped, aspirating, illuminating, and adjustable styles. The EndoProbe is offered in a wide variety of gauges. 

G-Probe. The G-Probe is used in procedures to treat medically and surgically uncontrolled glaucoma, in many instances replacing cyclocryotherapy (freezing of eye tissues). The G-Probe&#8217;s non-invasive procedure takes approximately ten minutes, is performed on an anesthetized eye in the doctor&#8217;s office, and results in less pain and fewer adverse side effects than cyclocryotherapy. The G-Probe is a sterile single-use product . 

DioPexy Probe. The DioPexy Probe is a hand-held instrument which is used in procedures to treat retinal tears and b reaks non-invasively through the sclera as an alternative method of attaching the retina. We believe that our DioPexy Probe generally results in increased precision, less pain and less inflammation than traditional cryotherapy . 

GreenTip Soft Tip Cannula. The GreenTip cannula allows surgeons to effectively visualize and access the proximity of the retina while performing a fluid air exchange during a vitrectomy procedure. Benefits include optimal contrast against the retina, maximized visualization and greater protection of the retina with its unique atraumatic silicone tip. The GreenTip cannula is a sterile disposable single-use product. 

MoistAir In-Line Air Humidifier. The MoistAir Humidifying Chamber connects to the air line and provides humidified air to the eye during fluid air exchange. Studies have shown that the use of humidified air can substantially reduce the dehydrating effects, delay lens feathering, protect corneal endothelium, and may prevent visual field loss defects after macular hole surgery. The MoistAir Humidifying Chamber is a sterile disposable single use product. 

Ophthalmology Treatments 

The following chart lists the procedures for treating ophthalmic diseases that can be addressed by utilizing our ophthalmic laser systems. These procedures typically are performed in an OR, ASC&#8217;s or clinic/outpatient settings and are non-elective and covered by insurance.

Research and Development 

We have close working relationships with researchers, clinicians and practicing physicians around the world who provide new ideas, test the feasibility of these new ideas and assist us in validating new products and new applications before they are introduced. 

Our internal research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) activities are performed by a current team of 17 engineers, scientists and regulatory professionals with experience in various aspects of medical products, laser systems, delivery devices and clinical techniques with a focus on introducing innovative products which satisfy the unmet and emerging needs of our customers. The core competencies of the team include: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, optics, lasers, fiber optics, software, firmware and delivery devices. The R&#38;D process integrates all of the necessary disciplines of the Company from product inception through customer acceptance. This process facilitates reliable new product innovations and a consistent pipeline of innovative products for our customers. 

Our research activities are managed internally by our R&#38;D staff. We supplement our internal R&#38;D staff by hiring consultants and/or partnering with physicians to gain specialized expertise and understanding. Research efforts are directed toward the development of new products and new applications for our existing products, as well as the identification of markets not currently addressed by our products. 

We believe that it is important to make a substantial contribution to improving clinical outcomes. For instance, we have made substantial investments in researching and improving the treatment of serious eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, and AMD. The objectives of developing new treatments and applications are to expand the potential patient population, to more effectively and more economically treat diseases, to treat patients earlier in the treatment regimen and to reduce the side effects of treatment. 

We spent $5.2 million on R&#38;D in 2015, $4.6 million in 2014 and $3.7 million in 2013. 

We consider clinical projects to be a component of our R&#38;D efforts and they may or may not result in additional commercial opportunities. 

Customers and Customer Support 

Our products are currently sold for use by ophthalmologists specializing in the treatment of eye disease in the retina, glaucoma and pediatrics eye diseases. Other customers include research and teaching hospitals, government installations, surgical centers, hospitals, and office clinics (outpatient). No single customer or distributor accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

We seek to provide superior customer support and service and believe that our customer service and technical support distinguish our product offerings from those of our competitors. We provide depot service at our Mountain View facility for our ophthalmology products. Our customer support representatives assist customers with orders, warranty returns and other administrative functions. Our technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product-related questions. We maintain an &#8220;around-the-clock&#8221; telephone service line to service our customers. If a problem with a depot serviceable product cannot be diagnosed and resolved by telephone, a service loaner is shipped overnight to domestic customers under warranty or service contract, and by the most rapid delivery means available to our international customers, and the problem unit is returned to us. The small size and rugged design of our products allows for economical shipment and quick response to customers worldwide. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell and market our products in the United States predominantly through our direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors. Currently we have a direct sales force of 13 employees who are engaged in sales efforts within the United States and 5 employees engaged in managing our distribution sales efforts internationally. We also contract for the services of 15 independent sales representatives to supplement our U.S. direct sales efforts. Our sales are administered through our corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California. 

International sales represented 42.6%, 47.2% and 45.0% of our sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We believe that our international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our international sales are made principally to customers in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, Russia, Africa and Latin America. Our distribution agreements with our international distributors are generally exclusive and typically can be terminated by either party without cause with 90 days notice. International sales may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations, the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the economic condition in each country in which we sell our products. 

To support our sales process, we conduct marketing programs which include: our website, clinical education, email marketing, trade shows, public relations, market research, and advertising in trade and academic journals and newsletters. We typically participate in over 85 trade shows worldwide on an annual basis. These meetings allow us to present our products to existing and prospective buyers. 

Through marketing, we collaborate with our customers to identify new products and applications which help meet their needs, and in turn provides us with new product concepts, enhances our ability to identify new applications for our products and validates new procedures using our products. Customers include key opinion leaders who are often the heads of the departments in which they work or professors at universities. We believe that these luminaries in the field of ophthalmology are key to the successful introduction of new products and the subsequent acceptance of these new products by the general market. Acceptance of our products by these early adopters is key to our strategy in the validation and commercialization of our new products. 

In March 2013, we entered into a global distribution and supply agreement with Peregrine Surgical Ltd. (&#8220;Peregrine&#8221;). Under the agreement, we became a worldwide distributor for Peregrine labeled products and Peregrine became part of the IRIDEX supply chain.

Operations 

The manufacture of our visible light and infrared laser consoles and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. Completed systems must pass quality control and reliability tests before shipment. Our manufacturing activities consist of specifying, sourcing, assembling and testing of components and certain subassemblies for assembly into our final product. Currently we have a total of 29 employees engaged in manufacturing activities for these products. 

The medical devices manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. The principal regulator in the United States is the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). In April 1998, we received certification for ISO 9001/EN 46001, which is an international quality system standard that documents compliance to the European Medical Device Directive. In February 2004, we were certified to ISO 13485:2003, which replaced ISO 9001/EN46001 as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices. In August 2008, we received FDA 510(k) clearance on our family of IRIDEX IQ laser systems. This clearance covers the IRIDEX IQ 532 and IQ 577 laser systems and their associated delivery devices to deliver laser energy in either CW-Pulse, MicroPulse or LongPulse mode. These laser systems are intended for a wide range of specific applications in the medical specialties of ophthalmology. 

We rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, although we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in Mountain View, California. Some of these suppliers and manufacturers are sole source. We have some long-term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers but currently purchase most components on a purchase order basis. These components may not be available in the quantities required, on reasonable terms, or at all. Financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. Any failures by our third-party suppliers to adequately perform may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval, impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position. 

International regulatory bodies often establish varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all products &#8220;CE&#8221; marked, an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance to the European Medical Device Directive and all applicable standards. In July 1998, we received CE mark certification under Annex II guidelines, the most stringent path to CE certification. With 

Annex II CE mark certification, we have demonstr ated our ability to both understand and comply with all applicable standards under the European Medical Device Directive. This allows us to CE mark any product upon our internal verification of compliance to all applicable European standards. Currently, al l of our released products are CE marked. Continued certification is based on successful review of the process by our European Registrar during its annual audit. Any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of ope rations and financial condition. 

Competition 

Competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance, and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment. 

Our principal competitors in ophthalmology are Alcon Inc. (Novartis AG), Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Nidek Co. Ltd, Synergetics (Bausch and Lomb), Topcon Corporation, Ellex Medical Lasers, Ltd., Quantel Medical SA, and Lumenis Ltd. Most of these companies currently offer a competitive, semiconductor-based laser system for ophthalmology. Also within ophthalmology, pharmaceutical alternative treatments for AMD and diabetic macular edema (&#8220;DME&#8221;) such as Lucentis/Avastin (Genentech), Eylea (Regeneron), Macugen (OSI Pharmaceuticals), Ozurdex (Allergan) and ILUVIEN (Alimera Sciences), and to a lesser extent Visudyne (Valeant Pharmaceuticals), compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures. 

Some ophthalmic competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These are either developed internally or obtained from acquisitions such as RetinaLabs and Ocunetics. We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. We have been issued 28 United States patents and 14 foreign patents on the technologies related to our continuing products and processes, which have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2028. We have 12 pending patent applications in the United States and 25 foreign pending patent applications that have been filed. Our patent applications may not be approved. 

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us, without additional consideration, any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. 

Government Regulation 

The medical devices marketed and manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (&#8220;FDA Act&#8221;), the FDA serves as the principal federal agency within the United States with authority over medical devices and regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of such devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. 

In the United States, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II or III). The class to which the device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of pre-marketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market. If the device is classified as Class I or II, and if it is not exempt, a 510(k) pre-market notification will be required for marketing. Under FDA regulations, Class I devices are subject to general controls (for example, labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to Quality System Regulations (&#8220;QSRs&#8221;) requirements). Class II devices receive marketing clearance through a 510(k) pre-market 

notification. For Class III devices, a pre-market approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) application will be required unless the device is a pre-amendments device (on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in 1976, or subs tantially equivalent to such a device) and PMAs have not been called for. In that case, a 510(k) will be the route to market. A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent t o a legally marketed Class I or II medical device, or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for a PMA. The FDA may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or that additional inf ormation or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device&#8217;s safety and efficacy be performed. 

Commercial distribution of a device for which a 510(k) notification is required can begin only after the FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device. The FDA has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past. Even in cases where the FDA grants a 510(k) clearance, it can take the FDA between three and six months from the date of submission to grant a 510(k) clearance, but it may take longer. 

A not substantially equivalent determination, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For any of our products that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions. 

We have obtained 510(k) clearances for all of our marketed products. We have also modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. After a device receives a 510(k) clearance or a PMA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device. Device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDA Act requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable QSR regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design, development, manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services, to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 

Labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business. 

Export of our products is regulated by the FDA and is covered by the Export Amendment of 1996, which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved United States medical devices. However, some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide an FDA certificate of products for export (&#8220;CPE&#8221;) which requires the device manufacturer to certify to the FDA that the product has been granted pre-market clearance in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with QSR at the time of the last QSR inspection. The FDA will refuse to issue a CPE if significant outstanding QSR violations exist. 

We are also regulated under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product. 

The introduction of our products in foreign markets will also subject us to foreign regulatory clearances which may impose subs tantial additional costs and burdens. International sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. The regulatory review process varies from country to country. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging r equirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. In addition, each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The approval by the FDA and foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain. The nec essary approvals or clearances may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such approvals or clearances, or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances, could have a material adverse effec t on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies by the FDA or other foreign and domestic regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future. These laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Reimbursement 

The cost of a significant portion of medical care in the United States is funded by government programs, health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans. Our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as government programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly affected the spending budgets of doctors, clinics and hospitals to acquire new equipment, including our products. Under certain government insurance programs, a health care provider is reimbursed for a fixed sum for services rendered in treating a patient, regardless of the actual charge for such treatment. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimburses hospitals on a prospectively-determined fixed amount basis for the costs associated with an in-patient hospitalization based on the patient&#8217;s discharge diagnosis, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and regardless of the specific devices used in that procedure. 

Private third-party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health-care costs by imposing limitations on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. In general, these government and private measures have caused health care providers, including our customers, to be more selective in the purchase of medical products. In addition, changes in government regulation or in private third-party payers&#8217; policies may limit or eliminate reimbursement for procedures employing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective. 

Backlog and Seasonality 

We generally do not maintain a material level of backlog. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels. Our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. For example, our European sales during the third quarter are generally lower due to many businesses being closed for the summer vacation season. 

Employees 

Currently, we have a total of 108 full-time equivalent employees engaged in our ongoing ophthalmology operations, including 55 in operations (including manufacturing, quality, logistics and service), 25 in sales and marketing which does not include the 15 independent sales representatives, 17 in research and development and 11 in finance and administration. We also employ, from time to time, a number of temporary and part-time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis. At January 2, 2016, we employed 25 such persons. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, who are in great demand. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. We consider our employee relations to be good.
