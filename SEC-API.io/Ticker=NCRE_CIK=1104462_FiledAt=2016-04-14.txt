 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Business Development

New Century Resources Corporation (the "Company", "our", "us" or "we") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah in July of 1979 as WEM Petroleum, Inc. To fund its original business purpose, WEM Petroleum, Inc. filed a registration statement under the Utah Securities Act, and relied on the exemption from federal registration provided for in Section 3(a)11, Rule 147, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), for the purpose of offering for sale an aggregate of 4,000,000 of its unregistered common shares on an intrastate basis. The Issuer's Prospectus was declared effective on September 19, 1979 and the Company closed its offering with all shares offered sold to residents of the State of Utah for gross proceeds of $100,000. The Company subsequently amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase in its capital from 10,000,000 common shares authorized to 50,000,000 common shares authorized. From inception through 1981, the Company conducted operations in the oil and gas industry. Pursuant to an option granted the Company in August of 1979, the Company exercised its right to drill exploratory wells on 640 acres in Cache County, Utah. Although various wells were drilled and completed, the Company did not realize any revenues from these oil and gas operations. In 1984, the Company attempted to refocus its business efforts into the mining industry by entering into an option to lease property and mining equipment in Montana. It ceased any significant business operations in the latter part of the 1980's when it failed to exercise the option, due to lack of funding. In 1988, the Company made an effort to commence conducting business again by expanding its business purpose to include the marketing and development of high-tech products. The Company's Board was also authorized to seek out suitable candidates for acquisition or merger. In addition, the Company authorized a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares one (1) share for ten (10) shares, although the same was never affected. The Company ceased doing business until late 1993.

&#160;

&#160;

In October 1993, the Corporation changed its name to New Century Resources Corporation, acquiring 100% of the outstanding stock of G.C. Gulf Western Trading Limited (G.C.) in exchange for 7,200,000 shares of stock, which gave the stockholders of G.C. control of the Corporation by which it has conducted its operations. This acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of G.C. No goodwill or other write-up to fair market value of the assets of G.C. occurred at the time of the merger. In 1994, the company was re-domiciled in the state of Nevada. The Nevada entity became the surviving corporation and the Utah Corporation was dissolved on February 14, 1994. As a result of the merger/change of domicile, the Articles of Incorporation of the Nevada entity became the Articles of the Company.

&#160;

The Company divested itself of its 100% owned subsidiary G.C. on December 12, 2000, thereby eliminating the Trekkopje mining claims, a capitalized cost of $10,533,252, the related liabilities amounting to $8,500,000 from its acquisition, the note payable to its principal stockholder, which aggregated, came to a total of $1,046,640, and any claims to accrued interest. This divestiture was the unanimous decision of the board of directors, which was based in part, upon the Corporation's inability to raise the necessary capital to fund the exploration and development of the Trekkopje Uranium reserves. In addition, a feasibility study conducted by Dr. Brian Hamilton Jones played crucial role in their decision making process, concluding that, due to the current Uranium market, exploitation of the Uranium reserves on the property would not be financially viable, and did not foresee any immediate or mid-term prospects in world market conditions and pricing which would lead to a pricing level justifiable of the exploitation of the Uranium reserves.

&#160;

The Company has no commitments, understandings, or agreements with regard to any proposed business operations or opportunities. It is the intention of Management to actively solicit interested third parties who may be interested in acquiring a controlling interest in what is essentially a "shell" corporation. Such transactions are commonly referred to as "reverse mergers", whereby the Company would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of a private entity in exchange for a controlling interest in the public company. No assurance can be given that Management of the Company will be successful in attracting a suitable candidate for this type of transaction or some other type of business combination; or what time frame might be involved in consummating any such transaction.

&#160;

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared as if the Company had its corporate capital structure as of December 12, 2000.

&#160;

Upon the disposition, the Company re-entered the business development stage and accumulated deficits during the business development stage are reported effective as of January 1, 2005.

&#160;

Business of Issuer

Our discussion of the proposed business under this caption and throughout this Registration Statement is purposefully general and is not meant to restrict our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.

Based on proposed business activities, we are a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), we also qualify as a "shell company," because we have no (or nominal) assets other than cash and no (or nominal) operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions.

No trading market currently exists for our securities, and management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, or to register any securities under the Securities Act or state blue sky laws or the regulations thereunder until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.

&#160;

As of the most recent audited period, we have generated no revenues or earnings from operations and possess no significant assets or financial resources. As of December 31, 2013, we had $0 of cash on hand. Also, our independent auditor's report expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

We were originally organized as a company that conducted operations in the oil and gas industry; however, we are currently seeking a business opportunity. Currently we are a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may combine with any type of business that management believes to offer the greatest opportunity. 

We have conducted limited business operations since our inception, and expect to conduct no operations in the future, other than our efforts to effectuate a business combination. We, therefore, can be characterized as a "shell" corporation. As a "shell" corporation, we face risks inherent in the investigation, acquisition, or involvement in a new business opportunity. Further, as a "development stage" or "start-up" company, we face all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and difficulties related to such companies, including whether we will continue to be a going concern entity for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

There are no acquisitions, business combinations, or mergers pending or which have occurred involving the Company. Presently, we have no plans, proposals, agreements, understandings or arrangements of any kind or nature whatsoever to acquire or merge with any specific business or company, and we have not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation.

Upon the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, we will commence the search for a suitable target business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our officers and directors, and by our shareholders. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following types of factors:

&#160;

&#183;

Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;

&#160;

&#183;

Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;

&#160;

&#183;

Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;

&#160;

&#183;

The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and

&#160;

&#183;

Other relevant factors.

&#160;

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the merger or acquisition opportunity.

&#160;

We anticipate that we will locate and make contact with target businesses primarily through the reputation and efforts of our shareholders and directors, who will meet with existing management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, assets, products and services belonging to such prospects, or undertake such reasonable investigation as deemed appropriate. The Company has a network of business contacts, and we anticipate that prospective target businesses will be referred to us through this network of contacts.

In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, the Company will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial or other information which will be made available to us. The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business, including conducting a due diligence review, negotiating relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable Federal securities laws, state blue sky laws, foreign securities laws, if any, and corporation laws cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty.

&#160;

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable and may reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination or for the resulting entity to utilize. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred.

&#160;

We presently have no employees apart from our management. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to the business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. However, our officers and directors will devote such time as is reasonably necessary to carry out the business and affairs of the Company, including, the evaluation of potential target businesses and the negotiation of a business combination, and, as a result, the amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiations of a business combination.

Other than that certain convertible promissory note issued to George Christodoulou on January 8, 2012 in the principal amount of $8,500 accruing interest at 10% per annum for a period of two years, convertible into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of the Company's common stock at par value and that certain convertible promissory note issued to Robert J. Nielson on January 8, 2012 in principal amount of $7,622 accruing interest at 10% per annum for a period of two years, convertible into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of the Company's common stock at par value, we have no other commitments as of the date of this registration statement to issue any shares of common stock, preferred stock, options or warrants or other equity consideration. We will, in all likelihood, issue a substantial number of additional securities in connection with the consummation of a business combination. To the extent that such additional securities are issued, dilution to the interests of our shareholders will inevitably occur. Additionally, if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued in connection with the consummation of a business combination, a change in our control will occur which will also likely affect, among other things, our ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards, if any.

Any such change in control will likely result in the resignation or removal of our officers and directors. If there is a change in the people serving as our officers and directors, no assurance can be given as to the experience or qualifications of our new management. Our majority shareholder, Mr. George Christodoulou, considers it likely that in order to consummate a business combination, a change in control will ultimately occur; therefore, he anticipates offering not less than a controlling interest to a target business in order to effectuate a business combination. This will require the consent of our majority shareholder, Mr. Christodoulou, to achieve.

&#160;

Our majority shareholder may actively negotiate for or otherwise consent to the disposition of any portion of his common stock as a condition to or in connection with a business combination. Therefore, it is possible that the terms of any business combination will provide for the sale of all or any portion of the shares of common stock owned beneficially by our majority shareholder. If we have additional shareholders at the time a business combination is effected, it is possible that none of our other shareholders other than our current majority shareholder will be afforded the right to sell their shares of common stock in connection with a business combination pursuant to the same terms that our current shareholders will be provided.

&#160;

There are currently no limitations relating to our ability to borrow funds to increase the amount of capital available to us to effect a business combination or otherwise finance the operations of the target business. However, our limited resources and lack of operating history could make it difficult for us to borrow additional funds from other sources. The amount and nature of any borrowings by us will depend on numerous considerations, including our capital requirements, potential lenders' evaluation of our ability to meet debt service on borrowings and the then prevailing conditions in the financial markets, as well as general economic conditions. We do not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and there can be no assurance that such arrangements, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms commercially acceptable or otherwise in our best interests. Our inability to borrow funds required to effect or facilitate a business combination, or to provide funds for an additional infusion of capital into a target business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects, including the ability to effect a business combination. To the extent that debt financing ultimately proves to be available, any borrowings may subject us to various risks traditionally associated with indebtedness, including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow to pay principal and interest. Furthermore, a target business may have already incurred debt financing and, therefore, all the risks inherent thereto.

If our securities are issued as part of an acquisition, such securities are required to be issued either in reliance upon exemptions from registration under applicable Federal or state securities laws or registered for public distribution. We intend to primarily target only those companies where an exemption from registration would be available; however, since the structure of the business combination has yet to be determined, no assurances can be made that we will be able to rely on such exemptions. Registration of securities typically requires significant costs and time delays are typically encountered. In addition, the issuance of additional securities and their potential sale in any trading market which might develop in our common stock, of which there is presently no trading market and no assurances can be given that one will develop, could depress the price of our common stock in any market which may develop in our common stock. Further, such issuance of additional securities would result in a decrease in the percentage ownership of our shareholders.

Due to our small size and limited amount of capital, our ability to raise additional capital, if and when needed, could be constrained. Until such time as any enterprise, product or service which we acquire generates revenues sufficient to cover operating costs, it is conceivable that we could find ourselves in a situation where we need additional funds in order to continue our operations. This need could arise at a time when we are unable to borrow funds and when market acceptance for the sale of additional shares of our common stock does not exist. See Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation".

&#160;

We have neither the present intention, nor does the present potential exist for us, to consummate a business combination with a target business in which our officers and directors or their affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, have a pecuniary interest, although no existing corporate policies would prevent this from occurring. Although there are no current plans to do so, we may engage the services of professional firms that specialize in finding business acquisitions and pay a finder's fee or other compensation. Since we have no current plans to utilize any outside consultants or advisors to assist in a business combination, no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service, or regarding the total amount of fees that may be paid. However, because of our limited resources, it is likely that any such fee we agree to pay would be paid in cash and/or shares of our common stock. In no event will we pay a finder's fee or commission to any officer or director or to any entity with which they are affiliated for such service. Moreover, in no event shall we issue any of our securities to any of our officers, directors, or promoters, if any, or any of their respective affiliates or associates, in connection with activities designed to locate a target business.

&#160;

&#160;

Investment Company Act and Other Regulation

We may participate in a business combination by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such target business. We do not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, we intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Act"), and, therefore, to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

We will not enter into any business combination until the target business has obtained the requisite audited financial statements required to be included in a report on Form 8-K to be filed by us with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of Form 8-K, the Exchange Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder.

No assurances are given that subsequent to such a business combination that a trading market in our securities will develop, or, if such a trading market is developed, that it can be maintained with liquidity. We presently have 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized; none of these shares are currently issued and outstanding. We presently have 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, of which, 12,481,724 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding. As of the date hereof, other than mentioned herein, we have not provided to any shareholder registration rights to register under the Securities Act any shares of common stock of the Company. See "Market Price of and Dividends on the Company's Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters".

&#160;

We cannot estimate the time that it will take to effectuate a business combination. It could be time consuming, and possibly in excess of many months or years. Additionally, no assurance can be made that we will be able to effectuate a business combination on favorable terms, or, if such a business combination can be effected at all. We might identify and effectuate a business combination with a target business which proves to be unsuccessful for any number of reasons, many of which are due to the fact that the target business is not identified at this time. If this occurs, the Company and its shareholders might not realize any type of profit.

&#160;

No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into a business combination, as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.

Form of Acquisition

The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of our company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of our company and such promoters. Until we find such opportunity, we cannot state how the transaction will be structured or the sum required to consummate the acquisition or reverse merger. We anticipate that the Company would issue shares to the target company making the target company's shareholders the majority shareholders of New Century Resources Corporation. It is possible that some New Century Resources Corporation shareholders will sell some or all of their shares in a private transaction in connection with the merger or acquisition. However, until a target is identified and a definitive agreement entered, it is impossible to state what the terms of the transaction might be or the amount required to consummate the transaction.

As a general rule, federal and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations. We will evaluate the possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment for us, the target business and their respective stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our proposed tax treatment of a particular business combination.

&#160;

It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our own stock or other securities of our company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of our company prior to such reorganization.

&#160;

To the extent the Internal Revenue Service or any relevant state tax authorities ultimately prevail in re-characterizing the tax treatment of a business combination, there may be adverse tax consequences to us, the target business and their respective stockholders. Tax considerations, as well as other relevant factors, will be evaluated in determining the precise structure of a particular business combination, which could be effected through various forms of a merger, consolidation or stock or asset acquisition.

Our present stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of the voting shares following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of our directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders, other than our current stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.

We believe the sum required to consummate our acquisition or reverse merger is not determinable until the Company knows the terms of the transaction. The amount of cash the Company has on hand as of December 31, 2015 is $0. Such acquisition or reverse merger may be costly. We currently have very limited resources with which to complete the acquisition or reverse merger, and we have no cash to complete the acquisition or reverse merger.
