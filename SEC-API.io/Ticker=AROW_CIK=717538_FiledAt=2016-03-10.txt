The holding company &#8217; s business consists primarily of the ownership, supervision and control of our two banks, including the banks' subsidiaries. The holding company provides various advisory and administrative services and coordinates the general policies and operation of the banks. There were 511 full-time equivalent employees, including 66 employees within our insurance agency affiliates, at December 31, 2015 . 

We offer a full range of commercial and consumer banking and financial products. Our deposit base consists of deposits derived principally from the communities we serve. We target our lending activities to consumers and small and mid-sized companies in our immediate geographic areas. Through our banks' trust operations, we provide retirement planning, trust and estate administration services for individuals, and pension, profit-sharing and employee benefit plan administration for corporations. 

B. LENDING ACTIVITIES 

Arrow engages in a wide range of lending activities, including commercial and industrial lending primarily to small and mid-sized companies; mortgage lending for residential and commercial properties; and consumer installment and home equity financing. We also maintain an active indirect lending program through our sponsorship of automobile dealer programs under which we purchase dealer paper, primarily from dealers that meet pre-established specifications. From time to time we sell a portion of our residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") as well as a limited number of other financial institutions and governmental agencies. Normally, we retain the servicing rights on mortgage loans originated and sold by us into the secondary markets, subject to our periodic determinations on the continuing profitability of such activity. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Generally, we continue to implement lending strategies and policies that are intended to protect the quality of the loan portfolio, including strong underwriting and collateral control procedures and credit review systems. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and/or interest or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely. Home equity lines of credit, secured by real property, are systematically placed on nonaccrual status when 120 days past due, and residential real estate loans when 150 days past due. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when 90 days past due if the full collection of principal and interest is uncertain. (See Part II, Item 7.C.II.c. "Risk Elements.") Subsequent cash payments on loans classified as nonaccrual may be applied all to principal, although income in some cases may be recognized on a cash basis. 

# &#32;5 

We lend almost exclusively to borrowers within our normal retail service area in northeastern New York State, with the exception of our indirect consumer lending line of business, where we acquire retail paper from an extensive network of automobile dealers that operate in a slightly larger area of upstate New York and in central and southern Vermont. The loan portfolio does not include any foreign loans or any other significant risk concentrations. We do not generally participate in loan syndications, either as originator or as a participant. However, from time to time, we buy participations in individual loans, typically commercial loans, originated by other financial institutions in New York and adjacent states. In recent periods the total dollar amount of such participations has fluctuated, but generally represents less than 20% of commercial loans outstanding. Most of the portfolio is fully collateralized, and many commercial loans are further supported by personal guarantees. &#32;&#32;&#32; 

We do not engage in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we do not extend or purchase so-called "Alt A," "negative amortization," "option ARM ' s" or "negative equity" mortgage loans. 

&#160; 

C. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

The following generally describes the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. To the extent that the following information summarizes statutory or regulatory law, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular provisions of the various statutes and regulations. Any change in applicable law may have a material effect on our business operations, customers, prospects and investors. 

Bank Regulatory Authorities with Jurisdiction over Arrow and its Subsidiary Banks 

Arrow is a registered bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act") and as such is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB"). Arrow is not, at present, a so-called "financial holding company" under federal banking law. As a "bank holding company" under New York State law, Arrow is also subject to regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Our two subsidiary banks are both national banks and are subject to supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). The banks are members of the Federal Reserve System and the deposits of each bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The BHC Act generally prohibits Arrow from engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities other than banking, activities closely related to banking, and certain other financial activities. Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company generally must obtain FRB approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, voting shares of another bank or bank holding company, if after the acquisition the acquiror would own 5 percent or more of a class of the voting shares of that other bank or bank holding company. Bank holding companies are able to acquire banks or other bank holding companies located in all 50 states, subject to certain limitations. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), enacted in 1999, authorized bank holding companies designated as "financial holding companies" to affiliate with a much broader array of other financial institutions than was previously permitted, including insurance companies, investment banks and merchant banks. Arrow has not attempted to become, and has not been designated as, a financial holding company. See Item 1.D., "Recent Legislative Developments." 

The FRB and the OCC have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The FRB and the OCC conduct regular examinations of the entities they regulate. In addition, banking organizations are subject to periodic reporting requirements to the regulatory authorities. The FRB and OCC have the authority to implement various remedies if they determine that the financial condition, capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization's operations are unsatisfactory or if they determine the banking organization is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The authority of the FRB and the OCC over banking organizations includes, but is not limited to, prohibiting unsafe or unsound practices; requiring affirmative action to correct a violation or unsafe or unsound practice; issuing administrative orders; requiring the organization to increase capital; requiring the organization to sell subsidiaries or other assets; restricting dividends and distributions; restricting the growth of the organization; assessing civil money penalties; removing officers and directors; and terminating deposit insurance. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the depository institution's bank regulators. 

Regulatory Supervision of Other Arrow Subsidiaries 

The insurance agency subsidiaries of Glens Falls National are subject to the licensing and other provisions of New York State Insurance Law and are regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Arrow's investment adviser subsidiary is subject to the licensing and other provisions of the federal Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is regulated by the SEC. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Transactions between Banks and their Affiliates 

Transactions between banks and their "affiliates" are regulated by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the "FRA"). Each of our organization's non-bank subsidiaries (other than the business trusts we formed to issue our TRUPs) is a subsidiary of one of our banks, and also is an "operating subsidiary" under Sections 23A and 23B. This means the non-bank subsidiary is considered to be part of the bank that owns it and thus is not an affiliate of the bank. However, each of our two banks is an affiliate of the other bank, and our holding company (Arrow) is also an affiliate of each bank. Extensions of credit that a bank may make to affiliates, or to third parties secured by securities or obligations of the affiliates, are substantially limited by the FRA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"). Such acts further restrict the range of permissible transactions between a bank and any affiliate, including a bank affiliate. Furthermore, under the FRA, a bank may engage in certain transactions, including 

# &#32;6 

loans and purchases of assets, with a non-bank affiliate, only if certain special conditions, including collateral requirements for loans, are met and if the other terms and conditions of the transaction, including interest rates and credit standards, are substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the bank as, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by it with non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions that would be offered by it to non-affiliated companies. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Capital Standards 

An important area of banking regulation is the federal banking system's promulgation and enforcement of minimum capitalization standards for banks and bank holding companies. 

Bank Capital Rules . The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed U.S. bank regulators to promulgate new capital standards for U.S. banking organizations, which needed be at least as strict (i.e., must establish minimum capital levels that are at least as high) as the regulatory capital standards that were in effect for U.S. insured depository financial institutions at the time Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010. 

In July 2013, federal bank regulators, including the FRB and the OCC, approved their final new bank capital rules aimed at implementing these Dodd-Frank capital requirements. These rules were also intended to coordinate U.S. bank capital standards with the current drafts of the Basel III proposed bank capital standards for all of the developed world's banking organizations. The federal regulators' new capital rules (the "Capital Rules"), which impose significantly higher minimum capital ratios on U.S. financial institutions than the rules they replaced, became effective for our holding company and banks on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased in by 2019. 

The new Capital Rules, like the rules they replaced, consist of two basic types of capital measures, a leverage ratio and set of risk-based capital measures. Within these two broad types of rules, however, significant changes were made in the new Capital Rules, as discussed below. 

Leverage Rule . &#32;&#32;The new Capital Rules did not fundamentally alter the structure of the leverage rule that previously applied to banks and bank holding companies, except to increase the minimum required leverage ratio from 3.0% to 4.0%. The leverage ratio continues to be defined as the ratio of the institution's "Tier 1" capital (as defined under the new leverage rule) to total tangible assets (again, as defined under the new leverage rule). 

Risk-Based Capital Measures . &#32;&#32;The principal changes under the new Capital Rules involve the other basic type of regulatory capital measures, the so-called risk-based capital measures. As a general matter, risk-based capital measures assign various risk weightings to all of the institution's assets, by asset type, and to certain off-balance sheet items, and then establish minimum levels of capital to the aggregate dollar amount of such risk-weighted assets. The general effect of the new risk-based Capital Rules was to increase most of the pre-existing risk-based minimum capital ratios and to introduce several new minimum capital ratios and capital definitions. The basic result was to increase required capital for banks and their holding companies. 

Under the new risk-based Capital Rules, there are 8 major risk-weighted categories of assets (although there are several additional super-weighted categories for high-risk assets that are generally not held by community banking organizations like ours). The new rules also are more restrictive in their definitions of what qualify as capital components. Most importantly, the new rules, as required under Dodd-Frank, added several new risk-based capital measures that also must be met. One such measure is the "common equity tier 1 capital ratio" (CET1). For this ratio, only common equity (basically, common stock plus surplus plus retained earnings) qualifies as capital (i.e., CET1). Preferred stock and trust preferred securities, which qualified as Tier 1 capital under the old Tier 1 risk-based capital measure (and continue to qualify as capital under the new Tier 1 risk-based capital measure), are not included in CET1 capital. Technically, under the new rules, CET1 capital also includes most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), including unrealized securities gains and losses, as part of both total regulatory capital (numerator) and total assets (denominator). However, smaller banking organizations like ours were given the opportunity to make a one-time irrevocable election to include or not to include certain elements of AOCI, most notably unrealized securities gains or losses. We made such an election, i.e., not to include unrealized securities gains and losses in calculating our CET1 ratio under the new Capital Rules. The minimum CET1 ratio under the new rules, effective January 1, 2015, is 4.50%, which will remain constant throughout the phase-in period. 

Consistent with the general theme of higher capital levels, the new Capital Rules also increased the minimum ratio for Tier 1 risk-based capital, which was 4.0%, to 6.0%, effective January 1, 2015. The minimum level for total risk-based capital under the new Capital Rules remained at 8.0%, the same level as under the old rules. 

The new Capital Rules incorporate a capital concept, the so-called "capital conservation buffer" (set at 2.5%, after full phase-in), which must be added to each of the minimum required risk-based capital ratios (i.e., the minimum CET1 ratio, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio). The capital conservation buffer is being phased-in over four years beginning January 1, 2016 (see the table below). When, during economic downturns, an institution's capital begins to erode, the first deductions from a regulatory perspective would be taken against the conservation buffer. To the extent that such deductions should erode the buffer below the required level (2.5% of total risk-based assets), the institution will not necessarily be required to replace the buffer deficit immediately, but will face restrictions on paying dividends and other negative consequences until the buffer is fully replenished. 

Also under the new Capital Rules, and as required under Dodd-Frank, TRUPs issued by small- to medium-sized banking organizations (such as ours) that were outstanding on the Dodd-Frank grandfathering date for TRUPS (May 19, 2010) will continue to qualify as tier 1 capital, up to a limit of 25% of tier 1 capital, until the TRUPs mature or are redeemed. See the discussion of grandfathered TRUPs in section D of this item under "The Dodd-Frank Act." 

The following is a summary of the new definitions of capital under the various new risk-based measures in the new Capital Rules: 

# &#32;7 

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: &#32;&#32;Equals the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and qualifying minority interests, minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Such deductions will include AOCI, if the organization exercises its irrevocable option not to include AOCI in capital (we made such an election). Mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and investments in financial institutions are limited to 15 percent of CET1 in the aggregate and 10 percent of CET1 for each such item individually. 

Additional Tier 1 Capital: &#32;&#32;Equals the sum of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests, grandfathered TRUPs, and Troubled Asset Relief Program instruments, minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. 

Tier 2 Capital: &#32;&#32;Equals the sum of subordinated debt and preferred stock, total capital minority interests not included in Tier 1, and allowance for loan and lease losses (not exceeding 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. 

&#32;The following table presents the transition schedule applicable to our holding company and banks under the new Capital Rules:

These minimum capital ratios, especially the CET1 ratio (4.5%) and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (6.0%), which began to apply to our organization on January 1, 2015, represent a heightened and more restrictive capital regime than institutions like ours previously had to meet, and the four year phase-in of the new regulatory capital buffer, which began this past January 1, 2016, will add to the stress on banks' profitability. 

At December 31, 2015, our holding company and both of our banks exceeded by a substantial amount each of the minimum capital ratios established under the new Capital Rules, including the new minimum CET1 Ratio, the new minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, the new minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, and the new minimum Leverage Ratio. See Note 19 to our audited financial statements, beginning on page 99, for a presentation of our period-end ratios for 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Capital Classifications. &#32;&#32;Under applicable banking law, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The regulators have established five capital classifications for banking institutions, ranging from the highest category of "well-capitalized" to the lowest category of "critically under-capitalized". As a result of the regulators' adoption of the new Capital Rules, the definitions for determining which of the five capital classifications a particular banking organization will fall into were changed, effective as of January 1, 2015. Under the revised capital classifications, a banking institution is considered "well-capitalized" if it meets the following capitalization standards on the date of measurement: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00% or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00% or greater, provided the institution is not subject to any regulatory order or written directive regarding capital maintenance. 

As of December 31, 2015, our holding company and both of our banks qualified as "well-capitalized" under the new capital classification scheme. 

Dividend Restrictions; Other Regulatory Sanctions &#32;&#32; 

A holding company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its outstanding stock, as well as its ability to expand its business through acquisitions of additional banking organizations or permitted non-bank companies, may be restricted if its capital falls below minimum regulatory capital ratios or fails to meet other informal capital guidelines that the regulators may apply from time to time to specific banking organizations. In addition to these potential regulatory limitations on payment of dividends, our holding company ' s ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and our subsidiary banks ' &#32;ability to pay dividends to our holding company are also subject to various restrictions under applicable corporate laws, including banking laws (which affect our subsidiary banks) and the New York Business Corporation Law (which affects our holding company). The ability of our holding company and banks to pay dividends in the future is, and is expected to continue to be, influenced by regulatory policies, the phase-in of the new, more stringent bank capital guidelines and applicable law. 

In cases where banking regulators have significant concerns regarding the financial condition, assets or operations of a bank or bank holding company, the regulators may take enforcement action or impose enforcement orders, formal or informal, against 

# &#32;8 

the organization. If the ratio of tangible equity to total assets of a bank falls to 2% or below, the bank will likely be closed and placed in receivership, with the FDIC as receiver. 

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC 

Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution's compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC," is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If Arrow finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, Arrow must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. 

Reserve Requirements 

Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts and certain other types of deposit accounts. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Each of Arrow's subsidiary banks is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and implementing regulations. CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the bank regulatory agencies assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. CRA ratings are taken into account by regulators in reviewing certain applications made by Arrow and its bank subsidiaries. 

Privacy and Confidentiality Laws 

Arrow and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws that regulate customer privacy and confidentiality. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to adopt privacy policies, to restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer information with nonaffiliated parties upon the request of the customer, and to implement data security measures to protect customer information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, regulates use of credit reports, providing of information to credit reporting agencies and sharing of customer information with affiliates, and sets identity theft prevention standards. 

D. RECENT LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS 

The principal federal law enacted after the 2008-2009 financial crisis that attempted to deal with the causes of that crisis was the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Dodd-Frank has significantly affected all financial institutions, including Arrow and our banks. There are other earlier-enacted banking laws that continue to significantly impact our operations. The Dodd-Frank Act and these other statutes are discussed briefly below. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

As a result of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act on July 21, 2010. While some of the Act's provisions have not had, and likely will not have, any direct impact on Arrow, other provisions have impacted or likely will impact our business operations and financial results in a significant way. These include the establishment of a new regulatory body known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("the CFPB"), which operates as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve System and is authorized to issue rules for consumer protection, some of which have increased, and likely will continue to increase banks' compliance expenses, thereby reducing or restraining profitability. For depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets (such as Arrow's banks), the banks' traditional regulatory agencies (for our banks, the OCC), and not the CFPB, will have primary examination and enforcement authority over the banks' compliance with new CFPB rules as well as all other consumer protection rules and regulations. However, the CFPB has the right to include its examiners on a "sampling" basis in examinations conducted by the traditional regulators and is authorized to give those agencies input and recommendations with respect to consumer protection laws and to require reports and other examination documents. The CFPB has broad authority to curb practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive and abusive. What constitutes "abusive" behavior has been broadly defined and is very likely to create an environment conducive to increased litigation. This is likely to be exacerbated by the 

# &#32;9 

fact that, in addition to the federal authorities charged with enforcing the CFPB's rules, state attorneys general are also authorized to enforce certain of the Federal consumer laws transferred to the CFPB and the rules issued by the CFPB thereunder. 

Dodd-Frank also directed the federal banking authorities to issue new capital requirements for banks and holding companies. See the discussion under &#8220;Regulatory Capital Standards&#8221; on page 7 of this Report. Dodd-Frank also provided that any new issuances of trust preferred securities (TRUPs) by bank holding companies having between $500 million and $15 billion in assets (such as Arrow) will no longer be able to qualify as Tier 1 capital, although previously issued TRUPs of such bank holding companies that were outstanding on the Dodd-Frank grandfathering date (May 19, 2010), including the $20 million of TRUPs issued by Arrow before that date, will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital until maturity or earlier redemption, subject to certain limitations. The new bank Capital Rules, in their final form, preserve this "grandfathered" status of TRUPs previously issued by small- to mid-sized financial institutions like Arrow before the grandfathering date. Generally, however, TRUPs, which were an important financing tool for community banks such as ours, can no longer be counted on as a viable source of new capital for banks, unless the U.S. Congress passes legislation that specifically accords regulatory capital status to newly-issued TRUPs. 

Bank regulators have not finished promulgating all the rules required to be issued by them under Dodd-Frank and many of the new rules will have phase-in periods even after final promulgation. (Many of the rules already issued also will become effective only on a deferred, phased-in basis, including the recently issued new rules under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The following is a summary of some additional Dodd-Frank provisions likely to have a material impact, positive or negative, as the case may be, on us and our customers: 

1. Increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000 per customer made permanent by statute. 

2. Changes in the methodology for assessing FDIC deposit insurance premiums on banks. Such assessment as a result of Dodd-Frank is now asset-based, not deposit-based, as was previously the case. This change has had the effect of actually reduces insurance costs for most small- to mid-sized institutions, like Arrow. Under the new method, our premiums were reduced from $513 thousand of FDIC and FICO assessments for the first quarter of 2011 (the last quarter under the old deposit-based method of assessment), to $267 thousand of expense for the second quarter of 2011 (under the new asset-based method), a decline of 48%. 

3. New &#32; limitations imposed by Dodd-Frank on debit card interchange fees, which technically apply only to the very large banks having more than $10 billion in assets. Despite the fact that we are not a large bank, this change has already had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on us, as on many smaller banks, due to competitive pressures. &#160; 

4. Requirements for mortgage originators to act in the best interests of a consumer and to seek to ensure that a consumer will have the ability to repay certain consumer loans. This change imposes fiduciary-like standards on banks, exposing them to an enhanced risk of liability to customers and regulators generally. 

5. Requirements for comprehensive additional residential mortgage loan-related disclosures, which has increased our costs. 

6. A comprehensive overhaul of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act rules and information collection and data reporting requirements, which also has increased our costs. 

7. Statutory implementation of &#8220;source of strength doctrine&#8221; for both bank and savings and loan holding companies, under which the Federal Reserve can compel a holding company to contribute additional capital to its subsidiary depository institutions. 

8. Limitation of previously established Federal preemption standards for national banks (such as our banks). Dodd-Frank reduces the extent to which state law is preempted by Federal law with regard to certain operations of national banks, particularly the operations of their subsidiaries. This greatly increases the potential for state authorities as well as bank customers, to challenge the way national banks do business on a state-by-state basis, substantially increasing such banks' exposure. 

9. Repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits. This has enabled depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts, and more importantly, has exposed them to competitive pressures to do so (i.e., pay interest on commercial deposits), thereby increasing overall costs of their deposit liabilities. 

To date, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions has resulted in many new mandatory and discretionary rule-makings by regulatory authorities, a process that is still not completed, almost six years after Dodd-Frank's enactment. As a result, bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank operating subsidiaries have faced thousands of new pages of regulations and associated regulatory burdens still being formulated, several of which are highly controversial and the implementation of which will be costly and time consuming. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Other Federal Laws Affecting Banks 

Federal laws enacted in 2008, before Dodd-Frank, also in response to the financial crisis, included The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2008 (ARRA). These laws established emergency capital and liquidity support programs which enabled many major financial institutions to survive the crisis. Such programs served their purpose and have largely run their course or been superseded by subsequent statutory and regulatory measures, principally Dodd-Frank. We did not need to participate, nor did we request to participate or actually participate, in any of the emergency capital support programs. 

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (the "New Bankruptcy Act") became effective October 17, 2005. The New Bankruptcy Act addressed many areas of bankruptcy practice, including consumer bankruptcy, general and small business bankruptcy, treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy, ancillary and cross-border cases, financial contract protection amendments to Chapter 12 governing family farmer reorganization, and special protection for patients of a health care business filing for bankruptcy. The New Bankruptcy Act did not have a significant impact on our earnings or on our efforts to recover collateral on secured loans.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), signed into law on July 30, 2002, adopted a number of measures having a significant impact on all publicly-traded companies, including Arrow. Generally, Sarbanes-Oxley sought to improve the quality of financial reporting of these companies by compelling them to adopt good corporate governance practices and by strengthening the independence of their auditors. Sarbanes-Oxley placed substantial additional duties on directors, officers, auditors and attorneys of public companies. Among other specific measures, Sarbanes-Oxley required that the chief executive officers and chief financial officers of such companies certify to the SEC, in the holding company ' s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC, regarding the accuracy of the company's financial statements contained therein and the integrity of its internal controls. Sarbanes-Oxley also accelerated insiders' reporting requirements for transactions in company securities, restricted certain executive officer and director transactions, imposed obligations on corporate audit committees, and provided for enhanced review of company filings by the SEC. As part of the general effort to improve public company auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley placed limits on non-audit services that may be performed by a company's independent auditors and required that the company ' s Audit Committee review and approve in advance any non-audit services performed by the independent auditor, as well as its audit services. Sarbanes-Oxley created a federal public company accounting oversight board (the PCAOB) to set auditing standards, inspect registered public accounting firms, and exercise enforcement powers, subject to oversight by the SEC. 

In the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley, the nation ' s stock exchanges, including the exchange on which Arrow ' s stock is listed, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASDAQ &#174; "), promulgated a wide array of new corporate governance standards that must be followed by listed companies. The NASDAQ &#174; &#32;standards include a requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors of a listed company consist of Directors who are "independent" of management, as defined in exchange-adopted regulations, and that the audit, compensation and nomination committees of the Board consist exclusively of independent directors (with "independent," for purposes of serving on the audit and compensation committees, defined even more rigorously). Over the years, we have implemented a variety of corporate governance measures and procedures to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and the NASDAQ &#174; &#32;listing requirements. 

The USA Patriot Act initially adopted in 2001 and re-adopted by the U.S. Congress in 2006 with certain changes (the "Patriot Act"), imposes substantial record-keeping and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions, with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money-laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the Patriot Act's requirements. The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to maintain certain anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. The provisions of the Patriot Act impose substantial costs on all financial institutions, including ours. 

Deposit Insurance Laws and Regulations 

The FDIC, which collects insurance premiums from banks on insured deposits, has made several modifications in recent years to its deposit insurance premium structure that have had a significant impact on bank earnings, the most important of which was the FDIC's decision to calibrate premiums based on the total assets (versus total deposits) of insured institutions. This has tended to benefit smaller regional banks such as ours, that typically maintain a higher ratio of deposits to total assets than the large, money-center banks. In 2007, after a several year period in which banks were charged no or very low premiums for deposit insurance, the FDIC resumed charging financial institutions an FDIC deposit insurance premium, under a new risk-based assessment system. Under this system, institutions in Risk Category I (the lowest of four risk categories) paid a rate (based on a formula) of 5 to 7 cents per $100 of assessable deposits. 

In February of 2011, the FDIC finalized a new assessment system that took effect in the second quarter of 2011. The final rule changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity, adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, and set a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund (the successor to the Bank Insurance Fund). The changes went into effect in the second quarter of 2011. The rule (as mandated by Dodd-Frank) finalizes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund at 2% of insured deposits. It also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches 1.15% (so that the average rate over time should be about 8.5 basis points) and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. Also as mandated by Dodd-Frank, the rule changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank ' s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We are unable to predict whether or to what extent the FDIC may elect to impose additional special assessments on insured institutions in upcoming years, if bank failures should once again become a significant problem on a system-wide basis.

F. COMPETITION 

We face intense competition in all markets we serve. Competitors include traditional local commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, non-traditional internet-based lending alternatives, as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks. Like all banks, we encounter strong competition in the mortgage lending space from a wide variety of other mortgage originators, all of whom are principally affected in this business by the rate and terms set, and the lending practices established from time-to-time by the very large government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") engaged in residential mortgage lending, most importantly, &#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221; and &#8220;Freddie Mac.&#8221; These GSEs purchase and/or guarantee a very substantial dollar amount and number of mortgage loans, which in 2015 &#32;accounted for a large majority of the total amount of mortgage loans extended in the U.S. Additionally, non-banking financial organizations, such as consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities firms, money market funds, mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of the various other types of loan and financial products and transactional accounts that we offer, even though these non-banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us. Under federal banking laws, such non-banking financial organizations not only may offer products comparable to those offered by commercial banks, but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks.
