 I TEM 1. B USINESS . 

General 

CSB Bancorp, Inc. (&#147;CSB&#148;), is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1991. The Commercial and Savings Bank of Millersburg, Ohio (the &#147;Bank&#148;), an Ohio banking corporation chartered in 1879, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured up to the maximum amount provided by law by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). The primary regulators of the Bank are the Federal Reserve Board and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K sometimes CSB and the Bank are collectively referred to as the &#147;Company.&#148;

Business Overview and Lending Activities 

CSB operates primarily through the Bank and its other subsidiaries, providing a wide range of banking, trust, financial and brokerage services to corporate, institutional and individual customers throughout northeast Ohio. The Bank provides retail and commercial banking services to its customers, including checking and savings accounts, time deposits, IRAs, safe deposit facilities, personal loans, commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, installment loans, night depository facilities, brokerage and trust services. 

The Bank provides residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans to customers located primarily in Holmes, Tuscarawas, Wayne, Stark and portions of surrounding counties in Ohio. The Bank&#146;s market area has historically exhibited relatively stable economic conditions. The Company&#146;s market area experienced increasing economic activity in 2015 following six years of modest gains. Unemployment levels in Holmes County, at 3.2% in December 2015, have increased slightly from the reported 2.9% at December 2014. The balance of the Company&#146;s market area reported unemployment levels between 3.8% and 5.4% with a state unemployment average of 4.6% in December 2015. There is a tightening labor market for qualified employees 

&#160;

within banking, retail and construction sectors contributing to wage pressure within entry-level jobs. The local housing market continues to improve with increased sales and higher prices. Both new and used vehicle sales are slightly higher in 2015 with light trucks and SUV sales continuing to dominate the market with low fuel prices. Ohio reported slowing growth activity in manufacturing and a decline in energy drilling activity. Oil prices have dropped to record lows and regional gas output remains at historic highs as leveraged gas drillers fund cash and debt service. The Company&#146;s market is adjacent to areas of primary shale activity. 

Certain risks are involved in providing loans, including, but not limited to, the borrowers&#146; ability and willingness to repay the debt. Before the Bank extends a new loan or renews an existing loan to a customer, these risks are assessed through a review of the borrower&#146;s past and current credit history, the collateral being used to secure the transaction if any, and other factors. For all commercial loan relationships greater than $300,000, the Bank&#146;s internal credit department performs an annual risk rating review. In addition to this review, an independent outside loan review firm is engaged to review all watch list and adversely classified credits over $100,000, all commercial loan relationships greater than $750,000, a sample of commercial loan relationships less than $750,000, loans within an industry concentration and a sample of consumer/mortgage loans. In addition, any loan over $100,000 identified as a problem credit by management and/or the external loan review consultants is assigned to the Bank&#146;s &#147;loan watch list,&#148; and is subject to ongoing review by the Bank&#146;s credit department and the assigned loan officer to ensure appropriate action is taken if deterioration occurs. 

Commercial loan rates are variable as well as fixed, and include operating lines of credit and term loans made to small businesses, primarily based on their ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the business. Business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable and inventory typically secure such loans. When the borrower is not an individual, the Bank generally obtains the personal guarantee of the business owner. These loans typically involve larger loan balances, are generally dependent on the cash flow of the business and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Management reviews the borrower&#146;s cash flows when deciding whether to grant the credit in order to evaluate whether estimated future cash flows will be adequate to service principal and interest of the new obligation in addition to existing obligations. 

Commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by borrower-occupied business real estate and are dependent on the ability of the related business to generate adequate cash flow to service the debt. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. Commercial construction loans are secured by commercial real estate and in most cases the Bank also provides the permanent financing. The Bank monitors advances and the maximum loan to value ratio is typically limited to the lesser of 90% of cost or 80% of appraisal. Management performs much of the same analysis when deciding whether to grant a commercial real estate loan as when deciding whether to grant a commercial loan. 

Residential real estate loans carry both fixed and variable rates and are secured by the borrower&#146;s residence. Such loans are made based on the borrower&#146;s ability to make repayment from employment and other income. Management assesses the borrower&#146;s ability and willingness to repay the debt through review of credit history and ratings, verification of employment and other income, review of debt-to-income ratios and other measures of repayment ability. The Bank generally makes these loans in amounts of 80% or less of the value of the collateral or up to 95% of collateral value with private mortgage insurance. An appraisal from a qualified real estate appraiser or an evaluation primarily based on tax value is obtained for substantially all loans secured by real estate. Residential construction loans are secured by residential real estate that generally will be occupied by the borrower upon completion. The Bank usually makes the permanent loan at the end of the construction phase. Generally, construction loans are made in amounts of 80% or less of the value of the as-completed collateral. 

Home equity lines of credit are made to individuals and are secured by second or first mortgages on the borrower&#146;s residence. Loans are based on similar credit and appraisal criteria used for residential real estate loans; however, loans up to 100% of the value of the property may be approved for borrowers with excellent credit histories. These loans typically bear interest at variable rates and require certain minimum monthly payments. 

Installment loans to individuals include unsecured loans and loans secured by recreational vehicles (&#147;RV&#146;s&#148;), automobiles and other consumer assets. Consumer loans for the purchase of new RV&#146;s and new automobiles generally do not exceed 125% of dealer invoice on RV&#146;s or 100% of the purchase price of an automobile. Loans for used RV&#146;s and automobiles do not exceed 120% of the &#147;clean trade-in value&#148; as reported in the current &#147;NADA&#148; used guides. Overdraft protection loans are unsecured personal lines of credit to individuals who have demonstrated good credit character with reasonably assured sources of income and satisfactory credit histories. Consumer loans generally involve more risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of collateral and, in certain types of consumer loans, absence of collateral. Since these loans are generally repaid from ordinary income of the individual or family unit, repayment may be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, ill health or by a general decline in economic conditions. The Bank assesses the borrower&#146;s ability and willingness to repay through a review of credit history, credit ratings, debt-to-income ratios and other measures of repayment ability. 

&#160;

While CSB&#146;s chief decision-makers monitor the revenue streams of the various financial products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Company&#146;s banking operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. For a discussion of CSB&#146;s financial performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 178 employees, 144 of which were employed on a full-time basis. CSB has no separate employees not also employed by the Bank. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees are provided benefit programs, some of which are contributory. Management considers its employee relations to be good. 

Competition 

The Bank operates in a highly competitive industry due, in part, to Ohio law permitting statewide branching by banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. Ohio and federal law also permit nationwide interstate banking. In its primary market area of Holmes, Tuscarawas, Wayne, Stark and surrounding Ohio counties, the Bank competes for new deposit dollars and loans with other commercial banks, including both large regional banks and smaller community banks, as well as savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and investment companies. 

Competition within the financial service industry continues to increase as a result of mergers between, and expansion of, financial service providers within and outside of the Bank&#146;s primary market areas. In addition, securities firms and insurance companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may acquire commercial banks and other financial institutions, which can create additional competitive pressure.

Supervision and Regulation of CSB and the Bank 

CSB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. The regulation of financial holding companies and their subsidiaries by bank regulatory agencies is intended primarily for the protection of consumers, depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders. 

CSB is a bank holding company that has registered with the Federal Reserve Board (&#147;FRB&#148;) as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;). Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#147;GLBA&#148;), a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is &#147;well-capitalized&#148; under regulatory &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; provisions, is &#147;well-managed,&#148; and has at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;) by filing a declaration with the FRB that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company. CSB has been a financial holding company since 2005. No prior regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire certain companies, other than banks and savings associations, that are financial in nature as determined by the FRB. 

GLBA defines &#147;financial in nature&#148; to include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency activities; merchant banking activities; and activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. Bank subsidiaries of a financial holding company must continue to be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include divestiture of the subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank subsidiary of a financial holding company may not 

&#160;

acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better. 

As a financial holding company, CSB is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FRB under the BHC Act. CSB is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as administered by the SEC. 

The Bank, as an Ohio state-chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and the FRB. Because the FDIC insures its deposits, the Bank is also subject to certain regulations of that federal agency. The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry. The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;) established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in July 2010 (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). 

The earnings, dividends and other aspects of the operations and activities of CSB and the Bank are affected by state and federal laws and regulations, and by policies of various regulatory authorities. These policies include, for example, statutory maximum lending rates, requirements on maintenance of reserves against deposits, domestic monetary policies of the FRB, United States fiscal and economic policies, international currency regulations and monetary policies, certain restrictions on relationships with many phases of the securities business and capital adequacy and liquidity restraints. 

The following information describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that have, or could have, a material impact on the Company&#146;s business. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. These statutes and regulations are continually under review by the United States Congress and state legislatures and state and federal regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to CSB and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on their respective businesses. 

Regulation of Bank Holding Companies 

As a bank holding company and financial holding company under GLBA, CSB&#146;s activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FRB. CSB is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular examination and inspection by the FRB. 

The FRB has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including subsidiary banks). The FRB may initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations, and for unsafe and unsound practices. Under FRB policies, a bank holding company is expected to act as a &#147;source of strength&#148; to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the FRB may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. 

The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB in cases where a bank holding company proposes to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by it, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or another financial or bank holding company, or merge or consolidate with any other financial or bank holding company. 

The FRB also regulates and provides limitations on transactions between affiliates of a bank holding company, loans to directors and officers of bank affiliates, securities transactions and liability for losses incurred by commonly controlled banks in certain circumstances. 

&#160;

Regulatory Capital 

The FRB has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks, designed to absorb losses. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework, which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the guidelines included a minimum for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least half of the ratio composed of common shareholders&#146; equity, minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (known as &#147;Tier 1&#148; risk-based capital). The guidelines also provided for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, or &#147;leverage ratio,&#148; of 3% for financial holding companies and bank holding companies that meet certain criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating, and 4% for all other financial holding companies and bank holding companies. 

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the &#147;International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard&#148; (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1988. The new Basel III Capital Rules (&#147;Basel III&#148;) became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015, through January 1, 2019. 

The new rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, rather than the former 4.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio that remains at 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 

Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 

Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 

The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization&#146;s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phase in from 2015 through 2019. 

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5% composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625%. 

The implementation of Basel III did not have a material impact on CSB&#146;s or the Bank&#146;s capital ratios. 

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action 

The federal banking agencies have established a system of &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; to resolve certain of the problems of undercapitalized institutions. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; 

The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank&#146;s capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after it becomes &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; unless the bank&#146;s primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank&#146;s capital category. For example, a bank that is not &#147;well capitalized&#148; generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank&#146;s capital plan for the plan to be acceptable. 

Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be &#147;well-capitalized,&#148; a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met the ratio requirements in effect at that date to be deemed &#147;well-capitalized.&#148; See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on page 51 of CSB&#146;s 2015 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Management of the Company believes the Bank also meets the capital requirements to be deemed &#147;well-capitalized&#148; under the new guidelines. 

Deposit Insurance 

Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and the Bank is assessed deposit insurance premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Insurance premiums for each insured institution are determined based upon the institution&#146;s capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and other information deemed by the FDIC to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate is then applied to the amount of the institution&#146;s deposits to determine the institution&#146;s insurance premium. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated on average assets less average tangible equity. 

In addition, the FDIC has proposed changing the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years; update the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for established small banks and using the financial ratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank&#146;s composite examination rating). 

As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, federally-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any federally-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. 

The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

Fiscal and Monetary Policies 

The business and earnings of CSB are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the United States Government and its agencies. These policies are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. CSB is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which has regulatory authority over the supply of money and credit in the United States. 

The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy, the money markets and the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company can make no definitive predictions as to future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit levels. 

&#160;

Limits on Dividends and Other Payments 

There are various legal limitations on the extent to which subsidiary banks may finance or otherwise supply funds to their parent holding companies. Under applicable federal and state laws, subsidiary banks may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, their bank holding companies. Subsidiary banks are also subject to collateral security requirements for any loan or extension of credit permitted by such exceptions. 

Payments of dividends by the Bank are limited by applicable state and federal laws and regulations. The ability of CSB to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank. However, the FRB expects CSB to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and may require CSB to retain capital for further investment in the Bank, rather than pay dividends to CSB shareholders. Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting CSB&#146;s ability to pay dividends on its common shares. 

The FRB issued a policy statement that provides that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. At December 31, 2015, approximately $10.6 million of the total shareholders&#146; equity of the Bank was available for payment to CSB without the prior approval of the applicable regulatory authorities. See Note 12 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on page 52 of CSB&#146;s 2015 Annual Report. 

Customer Privacy 

Under the GLBA, federal banking agencies have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require distribution of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. 

USA Patriot Act 

In response to the events of September 11, 2001, the United and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#147;Patriot Act&#148;) was signed into law in October, 2001. The Patriot Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among federal banking agencies and law enforcement officials. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions to, among other things, establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. 

The Bank has established policies and procedures to be compliant with the requirements of the Patriot Act. 

&#160;

Corporate Governance 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;SOX&#148;) was signed into law on July 30, 2002. SOX contains important requirements for public companies with regard to financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with section 302(a) of SOX, written certifications by CSB&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that CSB&#146;s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state a material fact. CSB has also implemented a program designed to comply with Section 404 of SOX, which includes identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design of control effectiveness over process and entity-level controls and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. CSB is exempt from the requirement for external accountant attestation on internal controls, pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Management&#146;s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting is located on page 23 of the CSB 2015 Annual Report. 

Effect of Environmental Regulation 

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of CSB or its subsidiaries. CSB believes the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. CSB, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future. 

CSB believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of the Bank. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, the Bank mitigates environmental risk exposure by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. 

Executive and Incentive Compensation 

In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the &#147;Joint Guidance&#148;) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

Pursuant to the Joint Guidance, the FRB will review as part of a regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as the Company. Such review will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures are not being taken to correct the deficiencies. 

The Company&#146;s board and management believe its policies and procedures related to Executive and Incentive Compensation are compliant with the Joint Guidance. 

Future Legislation 

Various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced by the U.S. Congress, as evidenced by the sweeping reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act adopted in 2010. Such legislation may continue to change banking statutes and the operating environment of CSB and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could significantly increase or decrease costs of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions. With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the continuing implementation of final rules and regulations thereunder, the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remains very unpredictable.

&#160; The weighted average yields are calculated using amortized cost of investments and are based on coupon rates for securities purchased at par value, and on effective interest rates considering amortization or accretion if securities were purchased at a premium or discount. The weighted average yield on tax-exempt obligations is presented on a tax-equivalent basis based on the Company&#146;s marginal federal income tax rate of 34%.

&#160; The policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is to cease accruing interest on loans when management believes that collection of interest is doubtful, when commercial loans are past due as to principal and interest 90 days or more or when mortgage loans are past due as to principal and interest 120 days or more, except that in certain circumstances interest accruals are continued on loans deemed by management to be well-secured and in process of collection. In such cases, loans are individually evaluated in order to determine whether to continue income recognition after 90 days beyond the due date. When loans are placed on nonaccrual, any accrued interest is charged against interest income. Consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual but are charged-off after 90 days past due.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to $359 thousand, while $559 thousand would have been recognized had the loans been performing under their contractual terms. For the year ended December 31, 2013, interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to $388 thousand while $472 thousand would have been recognized had the loans been performing under their contractual terms. 

Impaired loans are comprised of commercial, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans, and are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate or at fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for loan losses is allocated to impaired loans. 

Smaller-balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total. Such loans include residential first-mortgage loans secured by one to four-family residences, residential construction loans, automobile loans, home equity loans and second-mortgage loans. These consumer loans are included in nonaccrual and past due disclosures above as well as impaired loans when they become nonperforming. Commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment. When analysis of borrower operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower&#146;s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements, the loan is evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible. 

At December 31, 2015, no loans were identified that management had serious doubts about the borrowers&#146; ability to comply with present loan repayment terms that are not included in the tables set forth above. On a monthly basis, the Company internally classifies certain loans based on various factors. At December 31, 2015, these amounts, including impaired and nonperforming loans, amounted to $10.4 million of substandard loans and $0 doubtful loans. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans greater than 10% of total loans that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in the loan portfolio table set forth above.

In making this judgment, management reviews selected large loans, as well as impaired loans, other delinquent, nonaccrual and problem loans and loans to industries experiencing economic difficulties. The collectability of these loans is evaluated after considering current operating results and financial position of the borrower, estimated market value of collateral, guarantees and the Company&#146;s collateral position versus other creditors. Judgments, which are necessarily subjective, as to the probability of loss and amount of such loss are formed on these loans, as well as other loans taken together. 

&#160;

The following schedule is a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses allocated by type of loan and related ratios. While management&#146;s periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem-loan situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-offs that occur.
