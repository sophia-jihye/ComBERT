 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Klever Marketing, Inc. is engaged in obtaining capital in order to file and acquire patents, to seek out and to investigate, develop, manufacture and market electronic in-store advertising, directory and coupon services which have potential for profit. The Company successfully conducted two in-store demonstrations of its shopping cart technology &#8211; the latest being in 2009 with the release of the Giving Cart and its Retailer Chime-Time Awards Programs. Subsequently, in 2010, the Company shifted its business model to mobile technology and has aggressively developed new applications using this technology.

&#160;

Product Base 

&#160;

Following a decade of development of its shopping cart-based electronic advertising technology, which was successful in demonstrating the advantages of electronic distribution and redemption of electronic coupons and promotions, the Company realized that mobile technology, primarily cell phones, had advanced to the level where Klever&#8217;s product base could be applied and considerably expanded into an entirely new product line. Accordingly, in 2010, the Company made a dramatic shift into mobile technology. Since that time the Company has made substantial progress on its mobile application development and implementation. The software programming of the consumer KleverShop 1.0 application has been completed and successfully tested in our demonstration store. The retailer and supplier KleverDash application has completed its database and backend programming, complete with a revised graphical user interface, and successfully tested in our demonstration store.

&#160;

2015 Mobile Application Development and Implementation 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company&#8217;s business efforts have concentrated on two areas: modifying the software to meet retailers&#8217; refined business requirements and expanding our contacts within the retail grocery industry. We completed our Wholesome Choice Market demonstration test in 2014, and the feedback led us to conclude that to best serve our clients we needed to 1) add a loyalty program with points and 2) develop store branding and license our KleverShop software, allowing markets to brand the application as their own. Following further discussions with our investors, we also decided that now was the time to upgrade our software to an entirely new development platform that would be much more efficient and effective in addressing the desired enhancements and provide for the needed scalability.

&#160;

All of these goals have been accomplished, and Klever rolled out its new and upgraded software, generically known as KleverShop 2.0. This new platform is highly efficient, and the new features deliver what our retailers have been asking for. For instance, our coupon options have been expanded. Our user interface provides for complete client branding in order to serve individual retailer needs. We have built our loyalty program designated KleverPoints, which gives retailers the opportunity to award points for various shopping functions that lead to greater basket uplift. Points are awarded for checking in and for redeeming coupons as well as total basket size.

&#160;

At the same time, we have been working on upgrading our KleverDash platform. We envision a number of ways to make this tool even more useful to suppliers and retailers, with easier coupon generation, more types of coupons and expanded graphics analytics. Analytics offer the key to expanded use of this module and is a key to retailers gaining increasing market share and basket uplift. Our future work will focus on the consumer engagement uses of our software tools.

&#160;

Our new software platform not only has far better built-in documentation but also allows us to embed hundreds of software tests that greatly reduce the debugging process. In addition we have purchased a Retalix POS test center to further enable us to eliminate any post-development bugs. And we are seeking certification from Retalix to be an approved 3rd party services provider.

&#160;

We continue to pursue marketing on 3 fronts: 1) Marketing to retail grocers in Southern California to establish a retailer base with established regional grocers, 2) Marketing through retail grocery associations who supply support services and tools to a broad range of retail grocers, and 3) Marketing through software companies who support the Retalix ISS45 POS software throughout the grocery industry.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Towards the end of the year we recognized that customer engagement tools could greatly help us to transition consumers to a digital couponing world. Retail grocers, with their customers making 2-3 trips to the store each week offer a wonderful opportunity to engage their customers with multiple messages responding to their shopping actions or inactions. Klever wants each customer to feel that their local grocery store is &#8220;their personal store.&#8221; We do this by sending personal messages to them, recognizing them when they are at the store, and most of all offering them promotions and coupons that respond to their particular food interests. And we don&#8217;t bother them with products they are not interested in. We also reward them with loyalty points for responding to our promotions and are able to give them special promotions. The Klever Shopping Platform combined with customer engagement tools offer a very powerful resource to retailers and manufacturers, while meeting the needs of consumers.

&#160;

The Company has also conducted a number of system failure tests to be sure we were prepared for network or power failures, overloading of data and a number of possible user errors in operating KleverShop. We also made further enhancements to KleverDash by including a supplier dashboard similar to the retailer dashboard. All of these features we are able to test on our in house POS laboratory.

&#160;

Anticipated Business Development in the Next 12 Months 

&#160;

In 2015, the Company&#8217;s goals have been clear. Wrap up the programming and testing of KleverShop 2.0 and the updated KleverDash, and release these products into the marketplace for revenue operations. With the KleverShop 2.0 development complete, along with the updated KleverDash, in 2016 we will now expand our programming to be compatible with other POS systems, including those in use by NCR and IBM/Toshiba. To further establish the credibility of our KleverShop 2.0 system, the Company is currently in the process of seeking certification from Retalix.

&#160;

Beyond that we are focusing on the integration of customer engagement tools into our application. Our initial feedback from this approach has been very encouraging and will greatly contribute to Klever&#8217;s future success.

&#160;

We will attempt to use this retailer base to promote our relationships with product suppliers to bring them into the fold of Klever product users. With these suppliers we will attempt to promote our KleverBank&#174; system for coupon management and consumer redemption, which when successful, is expected to place our Company in a very attractive position. We continue to differentiate ourselves as being a full service digital marketing provider to consumers, retailers and suppliers with platforms to meet all of their promotional needs. Notable progress is being made, and the Company is moving forward. However, we must caution the reader that Klever Marketing currently has no signed revenue contracts. No assurance or warranty can be given that the Company will be successful in implementing the efforts described in this report.

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

We announced in February 2016 the filing of a new Utility Patent, which functions on top of Klever's patented APP KleverShop 2.0 technology to further incentivize and motivate customers to use their mobile phones while shopping. This unique patent is expected to further induce shoppers in selecting Retailer daily discount coupon offerings along with Manufacturer discounts which they have not been motivated to do previously.

&#160;

We believe Klever's innovation, a first in the industry, will help the customer to save dollars and act as a major sales boost for the Retailer, and the Manufacturer.

&#160;

This new patent application, when approved, will support the acceptance of Klever&#8217;s innovative digital couponing App KleverShop 2.0 with its customer engagement tools, which we believe represents a definite win/win for the Retailer, Manufacturer, Customer and for the Company.

&#160;

We also announced that Klever is currently pursuing an agreement with one of the most successful major National Cloud-Based Companies, which we hope to be concluded in the near future. We believe this will accelerate Klever's penetration with the major retail supermarket chains, which could produce substantial revenue sources for the Company.
