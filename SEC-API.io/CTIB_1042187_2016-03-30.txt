 Item No. 1 &#8211; Description of Business 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

We develop, produce and distribute a number of consumer products and sell these products throughout the United States and in over 35 other countries, and we produce film products for commercial and industrial uses in the United States. Many of our products utilize flexible films and, for a number of years, we have been a leading developer of innovative products which employ flexible films including novelty balloons, pouches and rolls of film for vacuum sealing and storage of products in the home and films for commercial packaging applications.

&#160;

Our principal lines of products include:

&#160;

Novelty Products consisting principally of foil and latex balloons and other inflatable toy items, and also Candy Blossoms (small containers of arranged candy items, often including a small inflated balloon.)

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Vacuum Sealing Containers and Sealing Devices for home and consumer use to vacuum seal, store and preserve food and personal items.

&#160;

Flexible Films for food and other commercial and packaging applications.

&#160;

We leverage our technology to design and develop proprietary products which we market and sell and which we develop for our customers. We have been engaged in the business of developing flexible film products for 40 years and have acquired significant technology and know-how in that time. We currently hold several patents, and have patent applications pending, relating to flexible film products including specific films, zipper closures, valves and other features of these products.

&#160;

We print, process and convert flexible film into finished products and we produce latex balloons and novelty items. Our principal production processes include:

&#160;

&#183; Coating and laminating rolls of flexible film. Generally, we adhere polyethylene film to another film such as nylon or polyester. &#160;

&#183; Printing film and latex balloons. We print both plastic and latex films, with a variety of graphics, for use as packaging film or for balloons. &#160;

&#183; Converting printed film to balloons. &#160;

&#183; Converting film to flexible containers. &#160;

&#183; Producing latex balloons and other latex novelty items. &#160;

&#183; Assembly and inflation of novelty products and balloons. &#160;

In 1978, we began manufacturing metalized balloons (often referred to as &#34;foil&#34; balloons), which are balloons made of a base material (usually nylon or polyester) often having vacuum deposited aluminum and polyethylene coatings. These balloons remain buoyant when filled with helium for much longer periods than latex balloons and permit the printing of graphic designs on the surface. In 1985, we began marketing latex balloons and, in 1988, we began manufacturing latex balloons. In 1999, we acquired an extrusion coating and laminating machine and began production of coated and laminated films, which we have produced since that time.

&#160;

For more than 20 years, we have been engaged in the production of flexible containers for the storage of liquids, food products, household goods and other items, and in the coating, laminating and printing of flexible films for our novelty and container products and for the production of laminated and printed films we supply to others.

&#160;

We market and sell our foil and latex balloons and related novelty items throughout the United States and in a number of other countries in Latin America and Europe. We supply directly to retail stores and chains and through distributors, who in turn sell to retail stores and chains. Our balloon and novelty products are sold to consumers through a wide variety of retail outlets including general merchandise, discount and drugstore chains, grocery chains, card and gift shops, and party goods stores, as well as through florists and balloon decorators.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Most of our foil balloons contain printed characters, designs and social expression messages, such as &#8220;Happy Birthday,&#8221; &#8220;Get Well&#8221; and similar items. For a number of our balloon designs, we obtain licenses for well-known characters and print those characters and messages on our balloons.

&#160;

We produce flexible containers and rolls of film for use as flexible containers in a variety of applications, including (i) zippered pouches with valves for vacuum sealing of food and household products and (ii) pouches and rolls of film for use with vacuum sealing machines to vacuum seal, store and protect food and household items. We market and sell flexible containers and rolls of film for consumer storage uses through retail chains and outlets throughout the United States, and we provide flexible containers to others for resale. We market and sell vacuum sealing machines for use with pouches and rolls of film for the vacuum storage of food and household products.

&#160;

We provide laminated films and printed films to customers who utilize the film to produce bags or pouches for the packaging of food, liquids and other items.

&#160;

Commencing in 2014, we began assembling and producing Candyloons and Candy Blossoms - containers including candy items and air-inflated balloons - which we market to food store chains. Since 2014, we have distributed home container and organizing products, some of which we produce, to and through a related entity which distributes those products through a network of independent distributors in the United States. In 2015, we commenced the distribution of party goods in Mexico.

&#160;

In 2015, our revenues from our product lines, as a percent of total revenues were:

&#160;

&#183; Novelty Products 59% of revenues &#183; Vacuum Sealing Containers and Devices 22% of revenues &#183; Film Products 8% of revenues &#183; Other Products 11% of revenues &#160;

We are an Illinois corporation with our principal offices and plant at 22160 N. Pepper Road, Lake Barrington, Illinois.

&#160;

Business Strategies and Developments 

&#160;

Our business strategies, and recent developments related to our business, include:

&#160;

&#183; Focus on our Core Assets and Expertise . We have been engaged in the development, production and sale of film and container products for 40 years and have developed assets, technology and expertise which, we believe, enable us to develop, manufacture, purchase, market and sell innovative products of high quality within our areas of knowledge and expertise. We plan to focus our efforts on these core assets and areas of expertise &#8211; film novelty products, consumer vacuum storage systems, specialty film products, container products, laminated films and printed films &#8211; to develop new products, to market and sell our products and to build our revenues. &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Maintain a Focus on Margin Levels and Operating Costs in Order to Establish and Maintain Profitability . We consistently monitor, evaluate and manage our cost of goods sold, and our selling, general and administrative, expenses in order to establish and enhance profitability. &#160;

&#183; Develop New Products, Product Improvements and Technologies . We engage in research, design, innovation and development for the purpose of developing, and improving, products, materials, methods and technologies within our core product categories. We work to develop and identify new products, to improve existing products and to develop new technologies within our core product areas in order to enhance our competitive position and increase our sales. We seek to leverage our technology to develop innovative and proprietary products. In our novelty product lines, our development work includes new designs, new character licenses, new product developments, new materials and improved production methods. In our consumer storage product lines, we have developed new pouch closure systems and valves and new film methods for packaging applications. We have received seven patents for these developments and have patent applications pending. We developed and introduced a line of resealable pouches with a valve and pump system for household storage and vacuum sealing of food items. We introduced a line of vacuum sealing equipment for the vacuum sealing of pouches for food and household items and are engaged in development efforts to create new and enhanced vacuum sealing machines, accessories and related products. We work with customers to develop custom film products which serve the unique needs or requirements of the customer. &#160;

&#183; Develop New Channels of Distribution and New Sales Relationships . In order to increase sales, we seek to develop new channels of distribution and new sales relationships, both for existing and new products. Over the past several years, we have developed new distributors and customers for our pouch and novelty products, in the United States and in Europe, Mexico, Latin America and Australia, expanding the scope and level of our international sales and activities. We established an office and warehouse in Germany to support the extension of our sales and fulfillment activities in Europe. During 2011, we entered into a Trademark License Agreement with S.C. Johnson &#38; Son under which SC Johnson licensed our company to use the Ziploc &#174; Brand Vacuum Sealer System for home use with vacuum sealing machines to seal and store food and household items. This Agreement was renewed and extended for an additional three-year term in December 2014. We market and sell these machines and pouches throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. During the past three years, we developed a relationship with a related company engaged in the sale of home containers and organization products and have become a supplier of products, some of which we produce, to that company. During 2015, we became a distributor in Mexico for a major party goods company. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Enhance Our Productive Capacity. We invest in new plant and equipment when appropriate to expand the range and volume of products we produce. During 2008 and 2009, we acquired, installed and commenced operation of equipment which enabled us to produce the pouches and rolls of film for our vacuum sealing storage business we developed. During 2010 and 2011, we designed, assembled and installed latex balloon production equipment which significantly enhanced our production capacity for latex balloons to support our growing sales of this product line. We significantly expanded our warehouse, packaging and fulfillment facilities and operations during 2013. During the first quarter of 2014, we acquired printing equipment which almost doubled printing capacity to support our growing sales of foil balloons. We have acquired and installed a new latex balloon production machine in Mexico which has become operational in March 2016; this machine will enhance our latex balloon production capacity by approximately 30%. &#160;

Products 

&#160;

Foil Balloons . We have designed, produced and sold foil balloons since 1979 and, we believe, are the second largest manufacturer of foil balloons in the United States. Currently, we produce about 900 foil balloon designs, in different shapes and sizes, including the following:

&#160;

&#183; Superloons &#174; - 17&#34; and 18&#34; foil balloons in round or heart shape, generally made to be filled with helium and remain buoyant for long periods. This is our predominant foil balloon size. &#160;

&#183; Ultraloons &#174; - 31&#34; jumbo foil balloons made to be filled with helium and remain buoyant for an extended time. &#160;

&#183; Miniloon &#174; - 9&#34; foil balloons made to be air-filled and sold on holder-sticks or for use in decorations. &#160;

&#183; Card-B-Loons &#174; - 4 &#189;&#34; air-filled foil balloons, often sold on a stick, used in floral arrangements or with a container of candy. &#160;

&#183; Shape-A-Loons &#174; - 18&#34; to 48&#34; shaped foil balloons made to be filled with helium. &#160;

&#183; Minishapes - 11&#34; to 16&#34; small shaped foil balloons designed to be air filled and sold on sticks as toys or inflated characters. &#160;

In addition to size and shape, a principal element of the Company's foil balloon products is the printed design or message contained on the balloon. These designs include figures and licensed characters many of which are well known. We maintain licenses for several well-known characters.

&#160;

During 2014, we began assembling small containers of with candy items and air-filled balloons &#8211; Candy Blossoms and Candyloons &#8211; which we market and sell to chain stores.

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Latex Balloons . Through our subsidiary in Guadalajara, Mexico, Flexo Universal, S. de R.L. de C.V. (&#8220;Flexo Universal&#8221;), we manufacture latex balloons in 17 sizes and 62 colors. Many of these balloons are marketed under the name Partyloons &#174; and balloons are also marketed on a private label basis. We also manufacture toy balloon products including punch balls, water bombs and &#34;Animal Twisties.&#34;

&#160;

Vacuum Sealing Pouches and Systems . We produce, market and sell consumer vacuum storage pouches and systems for the vacuum storage of food and other household items. We produce (i) vacuum sealable bags and rolls of film for use with vacuum sealing devices for household storage and (ii) valved, resealable bags also for vacuum storage uses. Our valved, resealable bags function with a small hand or battery-powered pump to evacuate air from the bag when it is sealed. Since 2012, we have produced and marketed vacuum sealable bags and rolls of film under the Ziploc &#174; brand. We also market vacuum sealing machines, produced for us, under the Ziploc &#174; Brand Vacuum Sealer System. We have produced and marketed a line of valved, resealable bags under our Zipvac&#8482; line. This year, we are introducing a line of valved, resealable bags, including a line of vacuum sealing canisters to be sold under the brand Clever Fresh&#8482; by Clever Container Company.

&#160;

Packaging Films and Custom Film Products. We produce and sell films that are utilized for the packaging of various products, principally food products. We laminate, extrusion coat and print films and sell them to customers who utilize the films for packaging applications. Our customers generally use these film products to convert them to bags or pouches for the packaging of food and other products. We develop and produce for customers unique products composed of flexible film.

&#160;

Other Products. We now distribute, and to some degree produce, home organization and container products for Clever Container Company, an entity consolidated with our company as a variable interest entity, which engages in the direct sale of such products through a network of independent distributors. Also, in 2015, we began to distribute party goods in Mexico.

&#160;

Markets 

&#160;

Foil Balloons 

&#160;

The foil balloon came into existence in the late 1970s. During the 1980s, the market for foil balloons grew rapidly. Initially, the product was sold principally to individual vendors, small retail outlets and at fairs, amusement parks, shopping centers and other outdoor facilities and functions. Foil balloons remain buoyant when filled with helium for extended periods of time and they permit the printing and display of graphics and messages. As a result, the product has significant appeal as a novelty and message item. Foil balloons became part of the &#34;social expression&#34; industry, carrying graphics designs, characters and messages like greeting cards. In the mid-1980s, we and other participants in the market began licensing character and cartoon images for printing on the balloons and directed marketing of the balloons to retail outlets including grocery, general merchandise, discount and drug store chains, card and gift shops, party goods stores as well as florists and balloon decorators. These outlets now represent the principal means for the sale of foil balloons throughout the United States and in a number of other countries, although individual &#8220;vendors&#8221; remain a significant means of distribution in a number of areas.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Foil balloons are now sold in virtually every region of the world. The United States, however, remains the largest market for these products.

&#160;

Foil balloons are sold in the United States and foreign countries directly by producers to retail outlets and through distributors and wholesalers. Often the sale of foil balloons by the wholesalers/distributors is accompanied by related products including latex balloons, floral supplies, candy containers, mugs, plush toys, baskets and a variety of party goods.

&#160; 

Latex Balloons 

&#160;

For a number of years, latex balloons and related novelty/toy latex items have been marketed and sold throughout the United States and in many other countries. Latex balloons are sold as novelty/toy items, for decorative purposes, as part of floral designs and as party goods and favors. In addition to standard size and shape balloons, inflatable latex items include punch balls, water bombs, balloons to be twisted into shapes, and other specialty designs. Often, latex balloons include printed messages or designs.

&#160;

Latex balloons are sold principally in retail outlets, including party goods stores, general merchandise stores, discount chains, gift stores and drugstore chains. Latex balloons are also purchased by balloon decorators and floral outlets for use in decorative or floral designs. Printed latex balloons are sold both in retail outlets and for balloon decoration purposes including floral designs.

&#160;

Latex balloons are sold both through distributors and directly to retail outlets by the producers.

&#160;

Flexible Containers/Pouches 

&#160;

The market for flexible containers and pouches is large and diverse. Many companies engaged in the production of food items package their products in flexible containers or pouches, and, therefore, represent a market for these containers.

&#160;

Flexible containers and pouches are sold and utilized in the consumer market in numerous forms. They include simple open-top plastic bags, resealable bags and zippered bags. The market also includes containers and pouches of special design or purpose, including vacuumable bags for storage of food or household items or commercial uses.

&#160;

We participate in a segment of the market for vacuum sealing and storage of food and household items. These products generally are sold in retail chain stores, and to some degree, in grocery stores. The product lines sold include (i) zippered, resealable bags, incorporating a valve through which air can be evacuated by a hand pump or other device; (ii) pouches or rolls of film which can be sealed by vacuum sealing devices and (iii) vacuum sealing devices.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Printed and Specialty Films 

&#160;

The industry and market for printed and specialty films are fragmented and include many participants. There are hundreds of manufacturers of printed and specialty film products in the United States and in other markets. In many cases, companies who provide food and other products in film packages also produce or process the films used for their packages. The market for the Company's film products consists principally of companies who utilize the films for the packaging of their products, including food products and other items, usually by converting the film to a flexible container.

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

Balloon Products 

&#160;

We market and sell our foil balloon, latex balloon and related novelty products throughout the United States and in a number of other countries. We maintain marketing, sales and support staff and a customer service department in the United States. Sales in the United Kingdom are conducted by CTI Balloons Ltd. (&#8220;CTI Balloons&#8221;), the Company's subsidiary located in Rugby, England. Sales in Europe are conducted by CTI Europe GmbH (&#8220;CTI Europe&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s subsidiary located in Heusenstamm, Germany. Flexo Universal, our subsidiary in Mexico, conducts sales and marketing activities for the sale of balloon products in Mexico, Latin America, and certain other markets. Sales in other foreign countries are made generally to distributors in those countries and are managed at the Company's principal offices.

&#160;

We produce a complete catalog of our balloon products, and also prepare various flyers and brochures for special or seasonal products, which we disseminate to thousands of customers, potential customers and others. We participate in several trade shows for the gift, novelty, balloon and other industries and advertise in several trade and other publications.

&#160;

Flexible Containers/Pouches 

&#160;

We market several lines of flexible containers or pouches for household use to vacuum seal, store and preserve food and other household items.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We developed and, for several years, we have produced and sold a line of pouches and rolls of film for use with vacuum sealing machines to vacuum seal food and household items. Initially, we marketed these products through various retail channels under our brand or on a private label basis. On December 14, 2011, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with SC Johnson under which the Company is licensed to manufacture and sell a line of vacuum sealing machines and pouches under the Ziploc &#174; Brand Vacuum Sealer System. The agreement was initially for a three year term expiring on December 31, 2014 and was extended for a term commencing on January 1, 2015 and extending to December 31, 2017. The licensed product line includes vacuum sealing machines manufactured for the Company and pouches and rolls manufactured by the Company for use in the home to vacuum seal food items to preserve freshness and help prevent freezer burn.

&#160;

During 2007, we introduced a line of re-sealable pouches incorporating a valve permitting the evacuation of air from the sealed pouch by use of a hand pump supplied with the pouches. This line of products is marketed under the brand name ZipVac &#174; . We market this line of products principally to a direct sales company. We are introducing a line of resealable pouches and of vacuum sealable canisters under the brand Clever Fresh&#8482; which we will provide to Clever Container Company for sale and distribution by them.

&#160;

Printed and Specialty Films

&#160;

We market and sell printed and laminated films directly and through independent sales representatives throughout the United States. We sell laminated and printed films to companies that utilize these films to produce packaging for a variety of products, including food products, in both solid and liquid form, such as cola syrup, coffee, juices and other items. We seek to identify and maintain customer relationships in which we provide added value in the form of technology or systems.

We print on films in Lake Barrington, Illinois and we print on latex balloons in Guadalajara, Mexico.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We warehouse raw materials at our plants in Lake Barrington, Illinois and Guadalajara, Mexico and we warehouse finished goods at our facilities in Lake Barrington, Illinois; Lake Zurich, Illinois; Guadalajara, Mexico; Rugby, England and Heusenstamm, Germany. We maintain customer service and fulfillment operations at each of our warehouse locations. We conduct sales operations for the United States and for all other markets, except those handled by our Mexico, Germany and England facilities, at the Lake Barrington, Illinois facility. Sales for Mexico and Latin America are handled at our Guadalajara, Mexico facility; sales for the United Kingdom are handled at our Rugby, England facility; sales for Europe are conducted from our facilities in Heusenstamm, Germany.

&#160;

We maintain a graphic arts and development department at our Lake Barrington, Illinois facility which designs our balloon products and graphics. Our creative department operates a networked, computerized graphic arts system for the production of these designs and of printed materials including catalogues, advertisements and other promotional materials.

&#160;

We conduct administrative and accounting functions at our headquarters in Lake Barrington, Illinois and at our facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico, Rugby, England and Heusenstamm, Germany.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

The principal raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are (i) petroleum or natural gas-based films, (ii) petroleum or natural gas-based resin, (iii) latex, and (iv) printing inks. The cost of raw materials represents a significant portion of the total cost of our products, with the result that fluctuations in the cost of raw materials have a material effect on our profitability. The cost of our raw materials represented approximately 41.5% of our net revenues in 2015 compared to 41.7% in 2014. During the past several years, we have experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials. We do not have any long-term agreements for the supply of raw materials and may experience wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials in the future. Further, although we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate supplies of one or more of our raw materials in the future.

&#160;

A principal raw material for our latex balloon is natural latex. Over the past five years, the price of natural latex has been highly volatile, ranging from a low of approximately $2.15 per kilo to a high of $5.75 per kilo. During a portion of that time, when the price of latex rose rapidly, we were unable to increase the selling price of our latex balloons sufficiently to compensate for the increase in the cost of latex with the result that our margins on the sale of latex balloons declined significantly for a period of time. Over the past 3 years, the market price of natural latex has declined and our margins on the sale of latex balloon products have improved. However, the price of natural latex remains volatile and changes in the cost of latex may have a material effect on our gross margins for latex balloon products in the future.

&#160;

Many of the foil balloons we produce and sell are intended to be filled with helium in order to be buoyant. Over the past several years, the price of helium has increased substantially and the availability of helium has, on occasion, been limited. Limited availability and the increase in the cost of helium may adversely affect our sales of foil balloons in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

Information Technology Systems 

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters in Lake Barrington, Illinois and our warehouse / customer service facility in Lake Zurich, Illinois are serviced by PC-based local area networks. We interconnect the facilities via redundant voice and data services. Access to the network is available to all appropriate employees and is secured through nine Microsoft servers running Active Directory authentication. The network allows us to leverage printing resources, create shared file areas for cross-departmental functions and allows for a single source backup of critical business files. On the network we run Macola financial system software. Macola is a modular software system. We presently use the general ledger, order entry, inventory management, purchase order, manufacturing costing, controls and inventory controls, electronic data exchange and custom report writing modules of that system. Internal and external employee communications are handled by industry standard Microsoft Exchange email, allowing us to communicate with customers and vendors all over the world. We also provide secure, firewall protected, load balanced and redundant internet connections allowing employees to use e-mail, research issues, support customers and securely move data. Secure VPN connectivity is provided to our mobile and remote employees. A phone system located in Lake Barrington, and a phone system located in Lake Zurich, operate together to provide unified voice communications between both sites as well as for outside calls. These two phone systems are capable of operating independently should there be a failure at either site.

&#160;

At each of our Mexico, England and Germany facilities, we operate server computers and local area networks, accessible to employees at those facilities. At each of those facilities, we operate separate integrated financial, order entry and inventory management systems.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The balloon and novelty industry is highly competitive, with numerous competitors. We believe there are presently five principal manufacturers of foil balloons whose products are sold in the United States including Anagram International, Inc., Pioneer Balloon Company, Convertidora International S.A. de C.V., and Betallic, LLC. Several companies market and sell foil balloons designed by them and manufactured by others for them.

&#160;

We believe there are approximately five manufacturers of latex balloons whose products are sold in the United States (including Pioneer Balloon and Globos Occidental) and numerous others whose products are sold in other countries.

&#160;

We also compete with other manufacturers of foil and latex balloons in Europe, Latin America and Asia.

&#160;

Our company competes principally in the United States and Canada for the sale of vacuum sealing products. There are a number of companies who compete in those markets, principally Jarden Corporation, which was recently acquired by Newell Rubbermaid, Inc.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The market for films, packaging, flexible containers and custom products is fragmented, and competition in this area is difficult to gauge. However, there are numerous participants in this market and the Company can expect to experience intense quality and price competition.

&#160;

Many of the companies in these markets offer products and services that are the same or similar to those offered by us and our ability to compete depends on many factors within and outside our control. There are a number of well-established competitors in each of our product lines, several of which possess substantially greater financial, marketing and technical resources and have established extensive, direct and indirect channels of distribution for their products and services. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new developments and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Competitive pressures include, among other things, price competition, new designs and product development and copyright licensing.

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights 

&#160;

We have developed or acquired a number of intellectual property rights which we believe are significant to our business.

&#160;

Copyright Licenses. We maintain licenses on certain popular characters and designs for our balloon products. We presently maintain a number of licenses and produce balloon designs utilizing the characters or designs covered by the licenses. Licenses are generally maintained for a one or two-year term.

&#160;

Trademarks. We own ten registered trademarks in the United States relating to our balloon products. Many of these trademarks are registered in foreign countries, principally in the European Union.

&#160;

Patent Rights. We own, or have license rights under, or have applied for, patents related to our balloon products, certain film products and certain flexible container products. These include (i) ownership of two patents, relating to self-sealing valves for foil balloons and methods of making balloons with such valves, (ii) several foil balloon design patents, (iii) patents and applications related to the design and structure of, and method of, inserting and affixing, zipper-closure systems in a bag, (iv) patents related to one-way valves for pouches, (v) a patent related to methods of embossing film and utilizing such film to produce pouches with fitments, (vi) a patent related to vacuumable storage bags with fitments, and (vii) a patent application related to vacuum sealing equipment.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We maintain a product development and research group for the development or identification of new products, product designs, product components and sources of supply. Research and development includes (i) creative product development and design, (ii) creative marketing, and (iii) engineering development. During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we estimate that the total amount spent on research and development activities was approximately $633,000 and $633,000, respectively.

&#160;

Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

Our manufacturing operations in the United States are subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#34;OSHA&#34;). We believe we are in material compliance with OSHA. The Company generates liquid, gaseous and solid waste materials in its operations in Lake Barrington, Illinois and the generation, emission or disposal of such waste materials are, or may be, subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the generation, emission or disposal of waste materials. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations. Several states have enacted laws limiting or restricting the release of helium filled foil balloons. We do not believe such legislation will have any material effect on our operations.

&#160;

In August 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a rule under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country. Under the rule, issuers are required to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry and, if necessary, exercise due diligence process to ascertain the source of conflict minerals, defined as tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten, that are necessary to the functionality or production of their manufactured or contracted to be manufactured products. Companies are required to provide this disclosure on a new form to be filed with the SEC called Form SD. Companies were required to file Form SD on May 31, 2014 for the 2013 calendar period and annually on May 31 every year thereafter. The Company filed Form SD on May 29, 2015.

International Operations 

&#160;

We conduct operations in three locations outside of the United States:

&#160;

&#183; Flexo Universal, a 99%-owned subsidiary in Guadalajara, Mexico. Flexo Universal maintains a plant, offices and warehouse in Guadalajara, Mexico where we produce latex and foil balloons and print latex balloons. Flexo Universal conducts sales, warehousing and fulfillment operations, servicing principally the Company and other customers in the United States, our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Europe, customers in Mexico and Latin America and certain customers in Europe. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; CTI Balloons, a wholly-owned subsidiary located in Rugby, England. CTI Balloons maintains offices and a warehouse in Rugby, conducts certain packaging and inflation activities there and conducts sales, warehousing and fulfillment activities for customers principally in the United Kingdom. &#160;

&#183; CTI Europe, a majority-owned subsidiary located in Heusenstamm, Germany. CTI Europe maintains offices and a warehouse in Heusenstamm, Germany (near Frankfurt), conducts certain packaging and inflation activities there and conducts sales, warehousing and fulfillment activities for customers principally in Europe. &#160;

We rely, and are dependent, on our operations in Mexico for the supply of latex balloons in the United States, Mexico, Europe and other markets. Interruption of that supply would have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Company.
