MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise&#153; 

MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise enables users to query and analyze detailed, transaction-level databases, large Hadoop &#174; distributions, data warehouse appliances, departmental databases, cloud data sources, and user-owned data in spreadsheets. It transforms data into business insights through highly visual, interactive reports and dashboards that can be securely distributed to hundreds of thousands of users throughout an enterprise.

Five key business needs have driven demand for powerful analytics solutions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased consumption of analytics. In the past, dissemination of information was limited to a few power-users or analysts. Now, a wide range of information users &#150; from customer service representatives to the CEO within a company, and from customers to suppliers outside the organization &#150; can benefit from the insight that analytics provides. The wide acceptance of the Internet as an information source also has fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the Web to tens of thousands of users across an enterprise. In addition, demand for analytics on mobile devices is being driven by the growth of the mobile Internet and by the accelerating proliferation of mobile devices. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased data scalability. Increasing information generation, and in particular, the ability to capture and store electronically every business transaction and interaction, have made terabyte-size data warehouses commonplace. Due to very large data volumes at some organizations, such as data volumes generated by social media, data warehouses can now reach sizes in excess of tens of petabytes (1,000 terabytes). While transaction- and interaction-level information is now routinely captured, organizations often struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores. Organizations need to view data within its operational context &#150; making even the most detailed information meaningful to business users. As a result, users want the ability to easily discover trends hidden in these very large databases and to verify these trends by reviewing the underlying detail. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improved analytics system performance. The increase in user population sizes and data volumes puts a strain on analytics infrastructures. Business users expect to retrieve the information they are requesting within seconds of making the request. Mobile devices have set this expectation even higher by increasing demand for near instantaneous responses to requests. Analytics administrators need to systematically monitor and tune the analytics environment to provide the expected service levels. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improved data comprehension and visualization. As data volumes have increased, the growing work demands placed on business users have meant progressively less time available to users to monitor and improve their businesses and make informed decisions. As a result, business users need to view the data in a summarized, easy-to-grasp format and navigate to areas of concern for additional insight. Presenting the data in a highly visual, accessible, and interactive format to collate, view, and explore information with agility and ease of use improves the overall comprehension of the business and speeds up the decision-making process. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased demand for personalized, one-to-one customer and/or supplier experience. Many companies have implemented strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and/or supplier based on individual needs and preferences. They earn loyalty by providing superior service, security, and convenience. In order to successfully acquire, retain, and upgrade customers, these organizations need to understand their customers&#146; profiles, transaction histories, past responses to marketing campaigns, and interactions with customer service. This information is often stored in widely dispersed and complex data sources, and obtaining a holistic view of the customer can be challenging. 

&#160;

The volume of data available to enterprises is growing at a very high rate, being driven by greater transaction detail, more sensors, more external data, and more data from mobile and social media platforms. MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise helps organizations worldwide take advantage of this explosive growth in enterprise data by equipping managers and employees with timely, actionable information to make data-driven business decisions. 

Solutions built on MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise can give analysts, managers, and executives the critical insight they need to reduce costs, better allocate resources, improve efficiencies, and optimize operations. MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise can also be used to build stronger relationships with business partners and suppliers by providing insights for managing inventory levels, analyzing supply chains, and tracking vendor performance. MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise also includes predictive capabilities that enable organizations to leverage their historical data to project future business outcomes. 

MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise provides IT professionals with a powerful, highly automated mechanism for delivering insightful reports, visualizations, and dashboards to employees throughout an organization. In addition, MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise includes a self-service feature, MicroStrategy Visual Insight, which enables business users to upload, prepare, and explore enterprise data on their own, without any coding or IT expertise. With this feature, business users can spot trends and outliers in a completely visual and interactive way, thereby eliminating much of the need for IT to create reports and dashboards for them. 

MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise is available in two distinct end-user platforms: MicroStrategy Analytics and MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics is designed for enterprise-scale business intelligence, supporting high performance analytics on gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes of data. Organizations can deploy MicroStrategy Analytics on-premises or access the same functionality within the MicroStrategy Secure Cloud offering. MicroStrategy Desktop puts the power of MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise into the hands of individual users for self-service visual analytics and data discovery. The two products share a common user experience &#151; making it easy to start small with self-service analytics and grow into the production-grade features of MicroStrategy Analytics.

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Data discovery at scale. MicroStrategy Analytics offers data discovery capabilities and is available to the end user across all standard user interfaces. With its HTML5 interface, users are able to connect to most data sources, ranging from personal spreadsheets to enterprise warehouses and cloud hosted sources, and can blend and prepare the data on their own without any IT support. This fully self-service work flow also allows the extension of the software to integrate with other third party capabilities. For instance, although MicroStrategy Analytics includes a variety of out-of-the-box visualizations, it also provides the ability to include other third-party visualizations like D3 and high charts, as well as the ability to include native and third-party advanced analytics into native workflows. The dashboards that include all of these components can also be personalized and shared with thousands of users across the organization using MicroStrategy&#146;s powerful Distribution Services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Data to insight in minutes without IT involvement. MicroStrategy Analytics gives business users a simple, powerful, and fast way to analyze data with minimal set-up requirements. It is designed to allow business users to answer business questions on their own, avoiding the lengthy process of report specification and design. By using a variety of graphical visualizations to represent the entire analysis, users can easily and rapidly spot trends and outliers in large data sets, creating a user experience that seems to unfold in real time. In addition to this, MicroStrategy Analytics also supports traditional centralized BI through its metadata based architecture, from which MicroStrategy Analytics gains its ability to design highly reusable objects that deliver both high performance and scale. The combination of enterprise scalability along with data discovery features brings the power of enterprise analytics to the personal level, making it easy to extend the power of the entire MicroStrategy Analytics platform to everyone in the organization. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Actionable insight. MicroStrategy Analytics helps organizations accelerate the speed and productivity of their businesses by building mobile apps and Web dashboards that connect to back-end transactional systems and databases to include data entry and action-taking features, including: submitting orders, one-click approvals and denials, notes for tracking and directing business activity, and write-back to data sources. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Governed data discovery. MicroStrategy Analytics enables organizations to achieve data consistency and governance across every report, dashboard, visualization, and user within the system through a trusted and centralized metadata store. By leveraging our reusable metadata to define, manage, and maintain common definitions for metrics, attributes, data sets, and other objects through governed data discovery, organizations can lower the overall cost of developing new analytical outputs (such as reports or dashboards), while helping to ensure that the information delivered in those outputs is accurate, governed, and timely. MicroStrategy Analytics not only provides governance via centralized IT deployments where the dashboards and applications are based around a centralized metadata store, but also offers the ability to promote Desktop-based dashboards created by business users to the MicroStrategy Server&#153;, and to map external data assets to certified data systems. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Heterogeneous access, joining and preparation of data from across the enterprise. MicroStrategy Analytics enables organizations to create integrated views of data across heterogeneous data stores. By mapping conforming dimensions from multiple sources within the MicroStrategy object model, the platform automatically joins data from multiple sources in the same table, chart, or visualization. Additionally, MicroStrategy Analytics also offers self-service data connect options to business users, who do not need to rely on data modeling or architecting to access any data source. Data can come from any source including most relational and columnar data warehouses, data marts, Apache&#153; Hadoop &#174; , SAP &#174; Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW), Microsoft &#174; SQL Server &#174; Analysis Services, IBM &#174; Cognos &#174; TM1 &#174; , Oracle &#174; Essbase, Salesforce &#174; , social media sources such as Twitter and Facebook, and many other operational system databases. In addition to allowing users to connect to these data sources, MicroStrategy Analytics offers data preparation and wrangling capabilities that allow business users to transform their data for improved analysis. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Integration of advanced analytics into mainstream reporting and analyses. MicroStrategy Analytics&#146; analytic engine includes predictive capabilities in MicroStrategy reports and analyses. The analytic engine can train and calculate many of the primary data mining functions, including time-series, association rules, clustering, regression, and decision-tree algorithms. Hand-in-hand with this calculation capability, MicroStrategy Analytics also includes the ability to import data mining models directly from data mining products from vendors like IBM &#174; SPSS &#174; , Teradata &#174; , and SAS &#174; using the predictive modeling mark-up language (PMML) standard, and by embedding R statistical packages in the platform. With this capability, data mining models, such as neural network algorithms, rule set algorithms, and support vector machines, as well as ensembles of models, can be imported through a single click and automatically converted into a standard MicroStrategy metric. After that, the MicroStrategy Data Mining Services TM extension enables these metrics to be used freely and calculated quickly in reports, analyses, and alerts. A key capability of MicroStrategy Analytics is that business users can now readily tap into over 350 advanced analytics and statistical functions for data discovery purposes, and these functions are included within an easily accessible library. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Support for large data volumes and all major relational database/hardware combinations. MicroStrategy Analytics supports systems with very large data volumes and is specifically optimized to support all major relational database platforms, Hadoop distributions, and data appliances commonly used for business intelligence systems, as well as multi-dimensional databases, such as SAP BW.

MicroStrategy&#146;s Metadata Architecture 

The core differentiator of MicroStrategy&#146;s products stems from their metadata-based centralized architecture, which has been built and refined over many years and provides access to all enterprise data using familiar business terms, rules, and logic. The portable, flexible, reusable, object-oriented and dynamic nature of the metadata provides an efficient BI application and mobile app development platform while maximizing maintainability and enforcing enterprise-wide consistency. The dynamic behavior of metadata in MicroStrategy products helps ensure consistency across business definitions, and minimizes the number of objects created, stored, and managed. Other BI technologies are limited in their reuse capabilities, forcing developers to create the same components over and over again for use in each individual report. 

MicroStrategy Server 

MicroStrategy Server is the architectural foundation of MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise. It provides the core analytical processing and job management for all reporting, analysis, and monitoring applications. It provides a powerful, comprehensive set of features necessary for a scalable, fault-tolerant, enterprise-wide business intelligence system. 

&#160;

As the central contact point to metadata, MicroStrategy Server dynamically assembles the metadata objects to create optimized, multi-pass SQL queries for every major relational database, HiveQL queries for Hadoop distributions, and MDX queries for multidimensional data sources. MicroStrategy Server retrieves the data, performs any additional analytical calculations not available in the databases, formats the report, and delivers the reports to business users via the MicroStrategy Web, Mobile, Office, or Desktop interfaces. 

MicroStrategy Server is a highly scalable, parallel-processing, self-tuning analytic server. It manages high performance interactions involving terabytes of data accessed by tens of thousands of users using in-memory intelligent cubes, caching, load balancing, resource prioritization, and connection pooling. It accesses and joins data from multiple data sources, such as data warehouses, operational databases, multidimensional (cube) databases, and even Web services and flat files. MicroStrategy Server also manages users, system security, data security, and user functionality access. A clustering option is available with MicroStrategy Server that increases scalability, and provides fault tolerance with automatic failover. 

MicroStrategy Web 

MicroStrategy Web is great for business users or consumers looking to interact with data, or to even simply view a static overview report. At the same time, MicroStrategy Web is where savvy analysts put all of the pieces together to design highly formatted and customized dashboards. 

MicroStrategy Web is the primary reporting interface for analysts, offering interactive reporting, dashboarding, and analysis through a Web browser. It provides enterprise analytical functionality with access to extensive report and document creation, manipulation, and formatting capabilities in an easy-to-use Web interface. 

MicroStrategy Web architecture provides a single, consistent interface to all users whether the BI application is departmental and internal, or an extranet application deployed to hundreds of thousands of users. MicroStrategy Web allows business users of any skill level to move fluidly between all styles of BI to satisfy their reporting, analysis, and monitoring needs.

This enables app designers to have more flexibility within the app workflow. Some useful scenarios that can be addressed with this new capability include: deleting the client cache for a document before executing it; limiting the location range to run a document for security reasons; and exposing the native share controls that are not provided out-of-box, like Share to Facebook, Twitter, etc. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) integration updates. The MicroStrategy Mobile SDK and integration points of MicroStrategy Mobile with AirWatch &#174; and MobileIron &#174; are now compatible with and certified for iOS9. 

&#160;

MicroStrategy Mobile Technology Strategy 

We continue to invest in enhancing MicroStrategy Mobile to empower our customers with the ability to build apps that drive their businesses forward and deliver revolutionary applications to their employees, partners, prospects, and customers. We continue to invest in enhancing MicroStrategy Mobile&#146;s overall performance and security as well as its three core capability areas: analytics, transactions, and multimedia. We remain focused on delivering the most compelling native end user experience on devices that are adopted by enterprises. New features specific to supported operating systems will take advantage of the native API&#146;s and incorporate new OS capabilities into apps built by MicroStrategy customers. 

We also continue to invest in bringing to life mobile apps in an easy, fast, and flexible way. We will continue to enhance our MicroStrategy Mobile technology to deliver an experience that is philosophically &#147;user first&#148; by combining a powerful user experience on top of a dynamic and accessible development infrastructure. 

Usher 

Usher, MicroStrategy&#146;s security solution, is a powerful mobile security platform designed to dematerialize traditional forms of identity verification (such as passwords, tokens, and physical badges) and replace them with a single mobile identity badge that is cryptographically linked to its owner&#146;s smartphone and dynamically linked to an enterprise&#146;s existing identity repositories. Usher works on standard smartphones running on iOS or the Android platform, and also boasts an Apple Watch integration. By delivering strong, multi-factor authentication that can be extended to nearly every corporate system, Usher&#146;s enterprise mobile security solution addresses some of the biggest challenges facing corporations today - including authentication, identity and access management, and resource authorization - while applying industry leading business intelligence and analytics to an enterprise&#146;s security infrastructure. Through the use of Bluetooth, QR codes, biometrics, push notifications, time-limited PIN codes, and other authentication methods, Usher users can log into applications, VPNs, and workstations, unlock doors and other physical gateways, and validate each other&#146;s identities. Usher can also be used as a powerful workforce management resource because it is designed to enable managers to gain a new real-time window into the activity of their distributed workforces, while providing powerful interactive features to manage or direct them. With the addition of Usher Professional, administrators can track user activity on a real-time map and communicate with users from the Usher application. Usher is available both as on-premises software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Secure Cloud. 

Usher can appeal to businesses, universities, associations, governments, and other organizations because it adds a layer of security to their systems, physical spaces, and transactions that would otherwise be technically difficult or cost-prohibitive. Usher is designed to secure an enterprise by offering an alternative to existing forms of identification and authentication. Usher is designed to provide a more secure alternative to passwords which can be stolen or cracked. Usher is also designed to help reduce identity-related fraud by replacing physical ID cards that can be counterfeited and stolen. 

Key benefits of Usher include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Identity protection. Usher mobile identities are designed to be more secure than traditional physical forms of identity, which can be stolen and counterfeited. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Authentication. Usher is designed to provide a more secure alternative to passwords &#151; which can be the weak link exploited by cybercrime attacks &#151; with secure mobile identities. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Physical access control. Usher users can unlock doors by tapping on a &#147;digital key&#148; or by scanning a QR code. If a device is Bluetooth-enabled, a user can unlock a door simply by approaching it. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Workforce management. Usher can collect data about the locations of users&#146; Usher activity, enabling managers to remotely monitor and direct distributed workforces. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Activity analysis. Usher uses MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise to monitor and analyze Usher user activity. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Convenience and cost-effectiveness. Usher allows users to carry their business credentials in digital form on their smartphones. Enterprises can reduce costs associated with the distribution and management of physical badges, cards, and keys, as well as the costs associated with identity-related fraud and cybercrime. 

&#160;

Usher Technology Strategy 

Our technology strategy for Usher is focused on taking advantage of developments in mobile and cloud technology to provide more flexible and powerful user identity-based security and analytics solutions. This involves continued development in the following areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Logical access. We continue to explore new techniques with which Usher can provide identity to applications and systems and provide alternatives to passwords, keys, and fobs. Our focus is on seamless, zero-click access based on proximity. Additionally, we continue to monitor the market and test new biometric measurement systems that can be integrated into Usher, such as Apple&#146;s Touch ID, voice authentication, and facial recognition. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Physical access. We continue to expand on the integration of Usher with physical access control systems and hardware, so that users with adequate credentials and digital keys can unlock secure doorways. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Action-oriented intelligence. We are focusing on enhancing Usher&#146;s ability to determine Usher member location and activities so that trends and anomalies can be used to provide better security or better workforce management.

MicroStrategy Secure Cloud delivers this high performance, tuned, and monitored environment as a service, lowering overall total cost of ownership.

Competition 

MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise and MicroStrategy Secure Cloud Competitors 

The analytics market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology paradigms. Within the analytics space, we compete with many different vendors, including (1) large software vendors (megavendors), such as IBM (Cognos), SAP (BO), Microsoft (Power BI), and Oracle (OBIEE), that provide one or more products that directly compete with our products; (2) open source analytics vendors such as Open Text (Actuate) and Hitachi (Pentaho &#174; ); (3) various other analytics software providers, such as Qlik, Tableau Software, TIBCO, Information Builders, and the SAS Institute; (4) pure-play mobile analytics vendors, such as MeLLmo (Roambi &#174; ), that do not offer an analytics platform, but offer a mobile user interface that can be used as an extension to existing analytics platforms; and (5) other vendors offering cloud-based offerings, such as GoodData and Birst. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate and compete with these vendors and other potential competitors across different sizes of analytics implementation projects. Failure to maintain adequate technology differentiation from these competitors could materially adversely affect our recurring software maintenance revenue and new license and subscription revenues from both existing and prospective customers. 

MicroStrategy Mobile Competitors 

The market for mobile analytics is rapidly evolving. New mobile devices are being introduced in the market at a rapid pace, and enhancements to mobile operating systems are being made at an even faster rate. The rapidly changing technology landscape creates opportunities for both existing competitors and new vendors to introduce innovative new products. Within the mobile analytics space, we predominantly compete with the same set of analytics vendors that we compete with in the analytics market. Our competitiveness in this market will depend on how quickly we can adapt to the changing technology landscape and how effectively we sell, market, and differentiate our offering. 

Usher Competitors 

Usher competes with technologies categorized as user authentication products, which are dominated by a few companies such as the RSA division of EMC, CA, SafeNet, Vasco, and Gemalto. These competitors focus primarily on traditional forms of identity verification such as smart cards, tokens, and password managers. These companies have significant name recognition and offer solutions with security architectures that are familiar to IT buyers. Usher also competes with companies with newer solutions, often involving mobile technology, including Telesign, Authentify, SecurEnvoy, Daon, Entrust, and Duo Security. 

&#160;

Restructuring and Executive Management Reorganization 

In the third quarter of 2014, we committed to a restructuring plan (the &#147;2014 Restructuring Plan&#148;) to streamline our workforce and spending to better align our cost structure with our business strategy, including reducing our workforce by 777 employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had implemented substantially all of the 2014 Restructuring Plan. We do not expect future costs associated with implementing the remainder of the 2014 Restructuring Plan, consisting primarily of the liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries, to be material. The 2014 Restructuring Plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $14.7 million for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 8, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#147;Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the 2014 Restructuring Plan. In addition to the 2014 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented other internal cost-savings initiatives. 

In January 2016, the Board of Directors implemented a reorganization of our executive management team to further streamline our business. The reorganization enabled us to eliminate a layer of management by eliminating a separate Office of the President and was designed to better position our business for profitable growth. This streamlining resulted in the departures of our former President, Paul N. Zolfaghari, and our former President and Chief Legal Officer, Jonathan F. Klein. See Note 19, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#147;Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the Executive Management Reorganization. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 1,947 employees, of whom 938 were based in the United States and 1,009 were based internationally. Of our 1,947 employees, 513 were engaged in sales and marketing, 461 in research and development, 663 in subscription, product support, consulting, and education services, and 310 in finance, administration, and corporate operations. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries some employees are members of trade or local unions. In France, our employees are represented by a works council as required by local law. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

The following table summarizes employee headcount, as of the dates indicated and reflects changes resulting from the 2014 Restructuring Plan as well as new hires and terminations outside the 2014 Restructuring Plan:
