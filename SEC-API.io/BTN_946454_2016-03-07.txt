General 

&#160; 

Ballantyne Strong Inc. (&#8220;BTN&#8221;, &#8220;Ballantyne&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, and &#8220;us&#8221;) is a holding company with diverse business activities focused on serving the cinema, retail, financial and government markets. The Company and its subsidiaries design, integrate, and install technology solutions for a broad range of applications; develop and deliver out-of-home messaging, advertising and communications; manufacture projection screens; and provide managed services including monitoring of networked equipment to our customers. We add value through our design, engineering, manufacturing excellence and customer service.

&#160; 

Ballantyne is a Delaware corporation which was founded in 1932 and became a designer and manufacturer of film projectors. Over the past 80 years, we have expanded our product lines and services to meet the needs of the ever-changing and technologically-advancing theatre exhibition industry. Most recently, we entered the digital media sector through an acquisition which enables us to serve the advertising, education and communication needs of retail, corporate, and government sectors. Ballantyne went public in 1995; our shares are traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;BTN&#8221;. 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations through two primary business segments: Cinema and Digital Media. In 2015, the Company renamed our segments from Systems Integration to Cinema and from Managed Services to Digital Media. There was no impact on current or prior years to the individual components of these segments. Approximately 67%, 67%, and 82% of our sales were from the Cinema segment for the years ended 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company elected a new Board of Directors at its 2015 annual meeting of shareholders on May 13, 2015. Since that time, the newly composed Board has been reviewing and considering the company&#8217;s strategy going forward and making changes in how the company views its investments and capital allocation decisions. 

&#160; 

The Company currently has two business segments, Cinema and Digital Media. The Board expects to continue to invest in these businesses and expects that these businesses will continue to generate free cash flow for the Company. 

&#160; 

As of March 3, 2016, the Company has no long term debt, approximately $20.6 million in cash, and approximately $5.6 in investments in other public companies. 

&#160; 

The new Board has implemented a strategy focused on making optimal capital allocation decisions across all of the company&#8217;s businesses and investments. The Board intends to continue to invest in and grow its Cinema and Digital Media businesses. At the same time, the Board intends to consider and make investments in other industries that are expected to produce higher returns on invested capital. This may involve investments in public companies or the complete acquisitions of other businesses, which may be within or outside of the Cinema and Digital markets. Investments in public companies may involve Ballantyne taking control positions or seeking board representation. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s investments in public companies currently include RELM Wireless Corporation (NYSE MKT: RWC), a manufacturer of two-way wireless radio communications equipment, and 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIH), a provider of property and casualty insurance in the State of Louisiana. As of March 3, 2016, the Company currently holds approximately 7.81% of the outstanding stock of RELM Wireless Corporation and approximately 4.47% of the outstanding stock of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. 

&#160; 

In some cases, funds controlled by the Company&#8217;s affiliate Fundamental Global Investors, LLC may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global&#8217;s funds currently hold positions in both RELM Wireless Corporation and 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. 

&#160; 

The Board also expects to consider investments and transactions in other areas that it believes are likely to increase returns to shareholders, such as continued stock buybacks or monetizing physical or other assets held by the company. 

&#160; 

The Board expects that over time the Company will be further transformed into a holding company with ownership of and investments in diverse businesses.

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Cinema 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We provide a full range of products and services to the theatre exhibition industry from the design and installation of new theatre exhibition systems and related equipment to complete film-to-digital theatre conversion services. The systems include a wide spectrum of premier audio-visual products and accessories such as: digital projectors, state of the art projection screens, servers and library management systems, menu boards, flat panel displays, and sound systems. 

&#160; 

We market and sell directly to theatre exhibitors, as well as through certain domestic and international Value Added Resellers &#8220;VAR&#8217;s.&#8221; Over the course of our 80-year history, we have developed ongoing customer relationships with a large portion of the theatre owners in the United States and a number of the major theatre owners internationally. Our sales and marketing staff principally develop business by maintaining regular personal contact with our established customer relationships, including conducting site visits. In our sales and marketing efforts, we emphasize our value proposition of providing the broadest range of products and services delivered by one of the industry&#8217;s largest technical service teams, which provides a significant resource to our clients in managing the complexities of digital technology in the cinema exhibition industry. Our sales and marketing professionals have extensive experience with the Company&#8217;s product lines and have long-term relationships throughout the industry. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Screens &#8212; We manufacture multiple standard and large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications through our ISO-certified manufacturing facility in Canada. There are certain digital 3D applications, such as the technology by RealD, that require unique &#8220;silver&#8221; screens that we manufacture. In addition, we purchased Peintures Elite, Inc. in 2013, the manufacturer of coatings that have been exclusive to our Company in the manufacture of our screens. This relatively small acquisition positioned us to retain the exclusive rights to this coating and continue producing our unique screens. We are constantly innovating to set new standards within the screen industry, and in 2013 we developed the new Premium HGA screen that diffuses light more evenly over the entire screen surface, thereby reducing the formation of so-called &#8220;hot spots.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Projectors &#8212; Through distribution agreements with NEC and BARCO, we distribute DLP Cinema projectors in the Americas and Asia. Both manufacturers of the projectors use the DLP cinema technology from Texas Instruments. NEC offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their NC900 projector for screens up to 31 feet wide to the NC3240S which is a 4K projector designed for screens up to 105 feet wide. BARCO offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their DP2K-10SX projector for screens up to 33 feet to the DP4K-32B cinema projector, which is an ultra-bright enhanced 4K cinema projector for screens up to 105 feet. 

&#160; 

Servers &#8212; Through a formal distribution agreement with GDC Technology (USA), LLC, we distribute GDC&#8217;s line of digital cinema servers in North and South America. We also distribute their servers in certain other areas of the world under less formal arrangements. In addition, we distribute servers for other server manufacturers, including those manufactured by Dolby. Digital servers and the related integrated media block are used by our customers for the storage and delivery of digital movie content. 

&#160; 

Audio Systems &#8212; We distribute a range of state of the art digital audio systems, including surround and 3D sound technologies from the following manufacturers: Dolby, Barco USL, JBL and QSC. Our technicians are certified by each manufacturer to install, service and maintain these and other audio systems. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additional Projection Products &#8212; We also manufacture or distribute certain third-party accessories, which coupled with the cinema projector, server and integrated media block, can fully outfit and automate a projection booth. The significant accessories include, but are not limited, to library management systems, automation products, pedestals, 3D accessories, lenses and lamps. 

&#160; 

Markets 

&#160; 

Cinema &#8212; Our non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and BARCO allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America, including the Caribbean. In China we have distribution rights to sell NEC and BARCO and can distribute NEC products in Hong Kong and certain other areas of Asia. We do not have any territorial restrictions for any of our other products and services. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Digital Projection Equipment &#8212; The markets for our products in the cinema segment have been highly competitive during the analog-to-digital cinema conversion. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes one other licensed OEM of the Texas Instruments&#8217; DLP cinema technology besides our partners NEC and BARCO: Christie Digital Systems. We also compete with SONY, which uses its own 4K digital cinema technology. 

&#160; 

Screens &#8212; While there are numerous screen manufacturing companies in the world, the primary competitor in the worldwide cinema screen market is Harkness Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability and price. 

&#160; 

Digital Media 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The Company delivers solutions and services across two primary markets: digital out-of-home and cinema. These markets are served through the capabilities that it has gained from the acquisition of Convergent in 2013 and from Strong Technical Services (&#8220;STS&#8221;) respectively. While there is digital signage and cinema equipment sold within this segment, the primary focus of this organization is providing solutions and services to our customers. 

&#160; 

Solutions 

&#160; 

Digital Signage &#8212; End-to-end digital signage solutions are at the core of our managed services offering, which include media strategy, application development, content creation, system integration, hardware, software, content distribution, management, network monitoring and field services. We primarily market our solutions to large businesses in North America and Latin America that do not have the resources or expertise to create, manage and maintain their digital signage system internally. These customers typically have complex solution requirements or require deployment across many locations. Customers utilize digital signage to increase product sales, improve the consumer experience, enhance their brand or inform their audience. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Video &#8212; We provide video communication services and solutions including design, integration, monitoring, maintenance and installation for the government and corporate markets. These solutions provide enterprises with the infrastructure necessary to communicate, collaborate, train and educate employees. We also provide monitoring and technical services that support free-to-guest solutions (such as in-room television) for customers in the hospitality, healthcare, and other industries involving multi-dwelling units and communication solutions. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

System Design and Integration within Digital Signage &#8212; We design and integrate systems to meet technical framework and requirements for our clients. We are technology agnostic, integrating a number of third-party systems and devices such as media players, servers, networking equipment and displays into our delivery platform. The design and integration services include sourcing hardware, developing integration points, set-up, configuration and quality assurance testing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Content Creation &#8212; We provide creative services to digital signage clients that include media strategy, content design and production. Our creative services team develops custom content to support the branding and marketing initiatives of each client. 

&#160; 

Content Management and Distribution &#8212; Content management is required to ensure accurate playback at the right place and at the right time based on a number of factors such as geography, site characteristics, location within a site or consumer demographics. We utilize both third-party and proprietary software platforms for the management and distribution of content. Content is prepared, scheduled and centrally distributed from our facility. We utilize secure virtual private network (&#8220;VPN&#8221;) connections across the Internet or the client network in accordance to specifications set by the client&#8217;s IT department. 

&#160; 

Network Operations Centers &#8212; Our NOCs, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operate 24/7/365 and provide IT solutions to our customers to meet Service Level Agreements (&#8220;SLA&#8221;). We are able to monitor our customers&#8217; networked equipment remotely through a VPN, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures. Our remote services include systems monitoring and maintenance, software upgrades and system repairs. By utilizing NOC personnel to solve customer issues whenever possible, we eliminate travel time and expenses normally incurred by sending a technician onsite for repairs. Many issues that do not involve parts replacement or physical contact with the hardware can be handled remotely using our remote assistance technologies. 

&#160; 

Service &#38; Maintenance &#8212; We supply digital installations and after-sale maintenance services. Our onsite technicians work closely with our NOC staff to resolve systems issues that cannot be fixed remotely; they are certified to install and service digital and audio equipment for all manufacturers, including the equipment of our competitors. We offer cabling, wiring, installation and maintenance services for digital menu boards and other digital equipment on ad hoc, as-needed basis. We also offer long-term contractual service packages for maintenance and repairs to a wide range of installed digital equipment for customers including equipment originally installed by our competitors. These long-term contractual service packages provide our Company with recurring revenue. 

&#160; 

Markets 

&#160; 

Digital Out-of-Home &#8211; The Digital Out-of-Home (&#8220;DOOH&#8221;) advertising market is a subset of the overall OOH advertising market that includes in-store digital displays and interactive promotion kiosks. DOOH marketing campaigns consist of a network of digital displays that are centrally managed and target both mobile and captive customers outside the home. We are primarily focused on pursuing DOOH communication opportunities within the retail, banking, entertainment, healthcare and corporate markets. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Video Solutions &#8211; The Enterprise Video Solutions (&#8220;EVS&#8221;) market consists of customers seeking corporate video communications, employee training and system monitoring solutions. We are primarily focused on pursuing EVS opportunities within the hospitality, government, banking, healthcare and corporate markets. 

&#160; 

Cinema &#8211; The cinema market consists of theatre exhibitors both domestically and internationally. The Company&#8217;s foundation was built in the cinema exhibition industry and this market remains a key focus of our Company. We market and sell our services directly to theatre owners and through dealers or VAR networks. Our sales and marketing staff principally develop business by maintaining regular personal customer contact including conducting site visits, while customer service and technical support functions are dispatched when needed. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There are many players in the Digital Out-of-Home market who have expertise in integration. Some of the key players include Diversified Media Group and Christie Digital. 

&#160; 

The competition in the cinema service industry for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is primarily driven by the two largest cinema service companies, the Company and Christie Digital Cinema, although there are several other smaller scale providers in the cinema market.

Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. 

&#160; 

Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations &#8211; for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements &#8211; may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products.
