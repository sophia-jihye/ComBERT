 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Company Background 

&#160; 

We are focused on developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests principally focused on early detection of high potential progressors to cancer. and leveraging the latest technology and personalized medicine for patient diagnosis and management. We currently have four commercialized molecular tests: PancraGen &#174; , a pancreatic cyst molecular test that can aid in pancreatic cyst diagnosis and pancreatic cancer risk assessment utilizing our proprietary PathFinder platform; ThyGenX &#174; , which assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy, ThyraMIR &#174; , which assesses thyroid nodules risk of malignancy utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. We also have on the market in a limited way, an assay also utilizing our PathFinder platform, for Barrett's Esophagus, an esophageal cancer risk classifier. We are planning to expand our approach to the Barrett&#8217;s market by potentially soft launching in 2016 an early assessment Barrett&#8217;s assay. We also have in development an assay for biliary cancer. 

Our mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science. We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genetic and other molecular alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics. 

In December 2015, we sold a majority of our Commercial Services, or CSO, business to Publicis Healthcare Solutions, Inc., or the Buyer, under a definitive asset purchase agreement for a total cash payment of $28.5 million, including an initial upfront cash payment of $25.5 million and $3.0 million of a working capital adjustment. The agreement was previously announced on November 2, 2015 and the transaction was approved by a majority of stockholders on December 22, 2015. We used the proceeds from the transaction to pay off our senior commercial debt and for ongoing working capital to fund the remainder of our CSO business winding down through March 2016, the transition to a molecular diagnostics company as well as our molecular diagnostics operations. Subsequent to the CSO sale, we also changed our corporate name to Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. and began trading under the trading symbol IDXG on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, or NASDAQ on December 23, 2015. 

&#160; 

With the completion of the CSO transaction and termination of related activities through March 2016, we will be a pure play in the expanding molecular diagnostics industry offering solutions for determining the presence of certain cancers to clinicians and their patients as well as providing prognostic pre-cancerous information, an expanding market opportunity. The molecular diagnostics market offers significant growth and strong patient value given the substantial opportunity it affords to lower healthcare costs by helping to reduce unnecessary surgeries and avoiding too frequent monitoring. We are keenly focused on growing our test volumes, securing reimbursement, and driving revenue for our three commercialized innovative tests as well as expanding our business by developing and promoting synergistic products in our market. 

In March 2016, we announced that we implemented a broad-based program to maximize efficiencies and cut costs as we focus on improving cash flows and profitability while completing our transition to a standalone molecular diagnostics business. In addition to reducing headcount, we have realigned our compensation structure, consolidated positions, eliminated programs and development plans that did not have near term benefits, streamlined and right-sized operating systems while reducing overhead. 

We have been successfully expanding the reimbursement of our products: 

&#8226; 

In February 2016, we announced that we received Medicare approval for coverage of ThyraMIR. As a result, the ThyraMIR test is now accessible to more than 50 million covered Medicare patients nationwide effective December 14, 2015. ThyGenX &#174; &#32;&#32;is already covered by Medicare, therefore, the addition of coverage for ThyraMIR provides Medicare covered patients the benefits of the ThyGenX/ThyraMIR combination test. 

&#8226; 

In January 2016. we announced that our Medicare administrative carrier, Novitas Solutions, issued a new local coverage determination, or LCD, for PancraGen &#174; . The LCD provides the specific circumstances under which PancraGen &#174; &#32;is covered. The new policy is non-conditional and may improve the efficiency of the testing process for doctors and patients. The LCD covers approximately 55 million patients, bringing the total patients covered for PancraGen &#174; &#32;to nearly 68 million.

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

&#8226; 

In August 2015, we announced that both the ThyGenX &#174; Thyroid Oncogene Panel and ThyraMIR &#174; &#32;Thyroid miRNA Classifier secured coverage by one of the largest independent Blue Cross Blue Shield plans which insures 3.3 million patients. This medical policy update, covering both ThyGenX &#174; &#32;and ThyraMIR &#174; , was the first large commercial insurance plan to cover ThyraMIR &#174; . 

&#8226; 

In July 2015, we announced that ThyGenX &#174; &#32;was approved by Aetna for assessing fine needle aspiration samples from indeterminate thyroid nodules. Aetna's insurance plans cover 46 million patients and its positive coverage decision brings the total number of patients covered for ThyGenX &#174; &#32;to be more than 100 million. 

On January 7, 2016, we were notified by NASDAQ that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of the stock exchange and that we have until July 5, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. We are currently considering available options to regain compliance. 

We were originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1986 and began commercial operations in 1987. In connection with our initial public offering, we re-incorporated in Delaware in 1998. We operate our molecular diagnostics business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Interpace Diagnostics, LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013 and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation (formerly known as RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc., or RedPath, which was formed in Delaware in 2007. 

Our executive offices are located at Morris Corporate Center 1, Building A, 300 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Our telephone number is (844) 405-9655. 

Our Business 

We are developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests to detect genetic and other molecular alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers, which are principally focused on early detection of high potential progressors to cancer. As a result of our acquisitions during 2014 of RedPath and certain assets from Asuragen, Inc., or Asuragen, we offer PancraGen &#174; &#32;(formerly known as PathFinderTG &#174; &#32;Pancreas), a diagnostic test designed for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts, ThyGenX &#174; , a next-generation sequencing test designed to assist physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules, and ThyraMIR &#174; , a novel microRNA gene expression classifier that was launched earlier this year. We also have on the market in a limited way, an assay also utilizing our PathFinder platform, for Barrett's Esophagus, an esophageal cancer risk classifier. We are planning to expand our approach to the Barrett&#8217;s market by potentially soft launching in 2016 an early assessment Barrett&#8217;s assay. We also have in development an assay for biliary cancer. 

Up through December 22, 2015 for the CSO business we sold and through March 2016 for the Established Relationship Teams, or ERT unit, we also provided pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostics and healthcare companies with full-service outsourced product commercialization and promotion solutions through our CSO business. Our CSO business offered customers a range of standard and customizable options for their products throughout their entire lifecycles, from development to commercialization.

&#8226; 

providing innovative, flexible, customizable and cost effective services to our customers. 

&#160; Reporting Segments 

&#160; 

We currently operate under one operating segment, which is our molecular diagnostic business. Until December 22, 2015 prior to the CSO sale, we operated under two reporting segments: Commercial Services and Interpace Diagnostics. The ERT unit, which was previously reported within Commercial Services, is included in discontinued operations through December 31, 2015. In February 2015, we completed the sale of Group DCA and have classified both the Commercial Services business and Group DCA as discontinued operations for reporting purposes. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

Our current business generates revenue from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, which we began selling in late 2014. The net revenue generated from our current business was $9.4 million &#32;for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Background 

Molecular diagnostics is one of the largest segments in the $57 billion in vitro diagnostics industry. 

&#32;The molecular diagnostics segment is highly fragmented with numerous science-based companies that have developed clinical tests that are on the market or ready or near ready to be marketed. A vast majority of these companies have very limited experience bringing a test to market and many of them do not have the capital to build an infrastructure to effectively commercialize their tests. Due to their complexity, most molecular diagnostic tests require a specialized go-to-market strategy that includes messaging to physicians and potentially patients and managed care organizations. Additionally, robust data and clinical studies are often necessary to convince physicians and managed care organizations of the benefit and utility of the assays offered. We believe that developing and delivering these kinds of messages is one of our core strengths. 

Oncology, which represents the second largest segment after infectious disease, is the fastest growing segment of the molecular diagnostics market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in June 2014 that there were more than 5,900 independent clinical reference laboratories and specialty clinics, and more than 8,900 hospital-based laboratories, in the United States. 

Our Molecular Diagnostic Tests 

We are developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests to detect genetic alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers, which are principally focused on early detection of high potential progressors to cancer. We offer PancraGen &#174; , a molecular diagnostic test designed for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts, and ThyGenX &#174; , a next-generation sequencing test designed to assist physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules, ThyraMIR &#174; , a novel microRNA gene expression classifier that was launched earlier in 2015, and PathFinderTG &#174; Barrett's, a Barrett's assay for Barrett's Esophagus, an esophageal cancer risk classifier and a test for biliary cancer, which we sell today to limited customers. We also have several additional diagnostic tests in late stage development that are designed to detect genetic alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal cancers. 

Gastrointestinal Cancer Tests 

Our current gastrointestinal cancer diagnostic test, PancraGen &#174; , (which provided the majority of our revenues in 2015) is based on our PathFinderTG &#174; &#32;platform (PathFinder). PathFinder is designed to use advanced clinical algorithms to accurately stratify patients according to risk of cancer by assessing panels of DNA abnormalities in patients who have lesions (cysts or solid masses) with potential for cancer. PathFinder is supported by our state of the art CLIA certified, and CAP accredited laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our Pittsburgh laboratory is our major commercial-scale and development Center of Excellence where we process the majority of our current and future oncology related tests and support our development activities through this laboratory. 

PancraGen &#174; &#32;is designed for determining the risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and we believe that PancraGen &#174; &#32;is the leading integrated molecular diagnostic test for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts currently available on the market. We estimate that the total market for PancraGen &#174; &#32;is approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. To date, PancraGen &#174; &#32;has been used in about 25,000 clinical 

&#32;7 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

cases. In February 2015, the results of a study by the National Pancreatic Cyst Registry were published in Endoscopy, the leading international periodical in the field of gastroenterology. The study involved ten institutions and a patient registry that examined the ability of PancraGen &#174; &#32;to determine malignancy in pancreatic cysts. This study demonstrated that PancraGen &#174; &#32;as a clinically validated test more accurately determined the malignant potential of pancreatic cysts than the Sendai 2012 guideline, which was a study to evaluate the accuracy of the Sendai 2012 EUS criteria for detection of malignant pancreatic cystic lesions in the context of routine clinical care. Accordingly, we believe that PancraGen &#174; &#32;provides a highly reliable diagnostic option for identifying patients with pancreatic cysts who are at low or high risk for developing pancreatic cancer. 

We have also developed a cancer diagnostic assay which is designed to evaluate patients with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, a common upper gastrointestinal condition that can progress into esophageal cancer. We have on the market in a limited way , this assay that also utilizes our PathFinder platform. We estimate that the total market is approximately $2 billion annually based on the current size of the patient population and anticipated reimbursement rates. We also have on the market in a limited way, an assay also utilizing our PathFinder platform. We are planning to expand our approach to the Barrett&#8217;s market by potentially soft launching in 2016 an early assessment Barrett&#8217;s assay. 

Endocrine Cancer Tests 

We have two endocrine cancer diagnostic tests that are currently on the market. ThyGenX &#174; &#32;is our DNA based 8 oncogene panel, next generation sequencing endocrine cancer diagnostic test currently on the market. ThyGenX &#174; &#32;is a next-generation sequencing test designed to assist physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules. ThyGenX &#174; , when applied to indeterminate fine needle aspiration, or FNA, provides a highly specific &#8220;rule-in&#8221; test with over 80% positive predictive value in predicting whether a patient&#8217;s thyroid nodule is cancerous. Our second endocrine cancer diagnostic test that was launched is ThyraMir &#174; , which is based on microRNA and is designed to provide a highly sensitive &#8220;rule-out&#8221; test to accurately categorize a mutation negative indeterminate FNA as being benign or malignant. Our technology is supported by our state of the art CLIA-certified laboratories in Pittsburgh, PA and New Haven, CT. We estimate the total market for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests is approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population, estimated numbers of indeterminate FNAs and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. 

Endocrinologists evaluate thyroid nodules for possible cancer by collecting cells through FNAs that are then analyzed by cytopathologists to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancerous. It is estimated that up to 30% or up to approximately 150,000 of FNAs analyzed annually yield indeterminate results, meaning they cannot be diagnosed as definitely being malignant or benign by cytopathology alone. Traditionally, guidelines recommended that patients with indeterminate cytopathology results undergo surgery to remove all or part of their thyroid to obtain an accurate diagnosis by looking directly at the thyroid tissue. Historically, in approximately 70% to 80% of these cases, the thyroid nodule proves to be benign. In addition to exposing a patient to unnecessary surgical risk and incurring costs, surgery can lead to a lifetime of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Our ThyGenX &#174; &#32;and ThyraMir &#174; &#32;assays, are aimed at significantly improving the ability of physicians to determine an accurate diagnosis of an indeterminate FNA result. 

Research and Development 

We conduct our research and development activities at our CLIA-certified New Haven laboratory and CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory in Pittsburgh. Our research and development efforts currently focus on providing data and clinical trials and analyses necessary to support our existing products on the market. Additionally our research and development activities provide product line extension of our existing products as well as new product opportunities utilizing our proprietary platforms. 

We will also focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing molecular diagnostic tests as new research becomes available. We may enter collaborative relationships with research and academic institutions for the development of additional or enhanced molecular diagnostic tests to further increase the depth and breadth of our molecular diagnostic test offerings. Where appropriate, we may also enter into licensing agreements with our collaborative partners to both license intellectual property for use in our molecular diagnostic test panels as well as licensing such intellectual property out, as appropriate. 

Significant Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics. Our revenue channels include reimbursement by Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and client billings (for example, hospitals and clinics), and commercial payors. 

Marketing 

&#160; 

&#32;8 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

Our commercialization efforts are currently focused in Endocrinology and Gastroenterology. Communication of our molecular diagnostic marketing messages are done through our field based sales teams, print and digital advertising, a web presence, peer-reviewed publications, and trade show exhibits. We believe that our molecular diagnostic tests provide value to payors, physicians and patients by lowering healthcare costs through avoidance of unnecessary surgeries, reducing the morbidity associated with unnecessary surgeries for patients, and providing better diagnostic and prognostic insights to physicians. We support our molecular diagnostic tests' value propositions through rigorous science that demonstrates their clinical and analytical validity as well as their clinical utility, which demonstrates how they actually impact physicians' decisions. We communicate this value proposition by leveraging our highly specialized Endocrine and Gastrointestinal Infection field sales channel. 

We also communicate to payors, integrated delivery systems and hospital systems about our molecular diagnostic tests' value through highly trained professionals who are experienced in reimbursement and business to business selling and through face to face meetings, phone calls, digital communications and advisory boards. We develop health economic analyses and budget impact models and incorporate these along with our clinical validation studies, and clinical utility studies to demonstrate our molecular diagnostic tests' value to this distinct and important constituency. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to us. We generate our own intellectual property and hold numerous patents and patent applications covering our existing and future products and technologies. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 2 issued patents in Australia and Japan and 9 pending patent applications in the United States and 7 pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and Japan. Our issued patents expire in 2027, and our pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our patents are directed to certain of the technologies relating to detecting, diagnosing, and classifying thyroid tumors, pancreatic cysts and other forms of gastrointestinal disorders, such as Barrett's esophagus. 

We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary processes to protect our intellectual property. We enter into non-disclosure agreements with certain vendors and suppliers to attempt to ensure the confidentiality of our intellectual property. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers. In addition, we require that all our employees sign confidentiality, non-compete and intellectual property assignment agreements. 

In addition to our own molecular diagnostic test development efforts, we are currently using, and intend to use in the future, certain tests and biomarkers that have been developed by third parties or by us in collaboration with third parties. While a significant amount of intellectual property in the field of molecular diagnostic tests is already in the public domain, ThyraMir &#174; , ThyGenX &#174; , PancraGen&#174;, and some of the future tests developed by us, or by third parties on our behalf for use in our tests, may require, that we license the right to use certain intellectual property from third parties and pay customary royalties or make one time payments. 

On August 13, 2014, the Company, consummated an agreement to acquire certain fully developed thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests, other tests in development for thyroid cancer, associated intellectual property and a biobank with more than 5,000 patient tissue samples (collectively the Acquired Property) from Asuragen pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, or the Agreement. The Company paid $8.0 million at closing and paid an additional $0.5 million to Asuragen for certain integral transition service obligations set forth in a transition services agreement, entered into concurrently with the Agreement. The Company also entered into two license agreements with Asuragen relating to the Company&#8217;s ability to sell the fully developed thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owe a $500,000 milestone payment, which was payable in February 2016, but which we are in the process of negotiating a restructuring of the payment. We are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miR Inform &#174; pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miR Inform &#174; thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale 

Additionally, we have a broad and growing trademark portfolio. We have secured trademark registrations for the marks PancraGen &#174; &#32;and miRInform &#174; in the United States, and miRInform &#174; with the World Intellectual Property Organization. We also have pending trademark applications for our other molecular diagnostic tests in the United States. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete on the basis of such factors as reputation, service quality, management experience, performance record, customer satisfaction, ability to respond to specific customer needs, integration skills, product portfolio, and price. Increased competition and/or a decrease in demand for our services or molecular diagnostic tests may also lead to other forms of competition. We believe that our business has a variety of competitive advantages that allow us to compete successfully in the marketplace. While we believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors, certain of our competitors are larger than us and have greater 

&#32;9 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

capital, personnel and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broader product lines outside of the molecular diagnostic testing market, and many have greater brand recognition than we do. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue. Increased competition may lead to pricing pressures and competitive practices that could have a material adverse effect on our market share and our ability to attract new business opportunities as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We also compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient&#8217;s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices and continue to support the use of molecular diagnostic tests in clinical guidelines. 

Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, has a molecular thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic test (Afirma) that is the current market leader and competes with our ThyGenX &#174; &#32;&#32;and ThyraMir &#174; &#32;tests. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX &#174; &#32;test and CBLPath, Inc., or CBL, is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing. Other competitors include Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Cancer Genetics, Inc., Genomic Health Inc., NeoGenomics Inc. and Trovagene, Inc. 

There are currently no direct competitors to PancraGen&#174; that integrate clinical, imaging, cytology, and molecular information to stratify patients' risk for malignancy and inform physicians on the best course of action, i.e. surgery or surveillance. Recently, one University Medical Center began offering a Next Generation Sequencing "gene only" panel that focuses on the analysis of a number of tumor suppressor genes, all of which are well known to be involved in cancer progression and are included in PancraGen&#174;. This test does not integrate any additional information to fully characterize a patient's risk for developing pancreatic cancer. Importantly, there has been no clinical validation study completed on any gene panel for pancreatic cyst fluid, whereas PancraGen&#174; has been validated in multiple studies and peer reviewed publications and has been used in over 25,000 patients. 

It is also possible that we face future competition from laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and other diagnostic companies developing new tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of new, unforeseen technologies that may be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space. 

To the best of our knowledge, there is no company currently marketing a Barrett's assay on the market; however, we are aware of companies that are in the process of developing assays and laboratory development tests for Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, so it is likely that this space will be competitive in the future. 

Government Regulations and Industry Guidelines 

The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive Federal, State, local and foreign regulation. Both Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business and most frequently cited in enforcement actions. 

Regulations Over Our Clinical Laboratories 

The conduct and provision of our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA. CLIA requires us to maintain Federal certification. CLIA imposes requirements relating to test processes, personnel qualifications, facilities and equipment, recordkeeping, quality assurance and participation in proficiency testing. CLIA compliance and certification are also a condition for participation by clinical laboratories in the Medicare Program and for eligibility to bill for services provided to governmental healthcare program beneficiaries. As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a State agency), or, if the laboratory is accredited, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to meet these certification, accreditation and licensure requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory&#8217;s CLIA certification, accreditation or license, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory&#8217;s ability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as imposition of plans to correct deficiencies, injunctive actions and civil monetary and criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, 

&#32;10 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could harm our business. In addition to CLIA requirements, we participate in the oversight program of the CAP. Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. CLIA does not preempt State laws that are more stringent than Federal law. State laws may require additional personnel quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing. 

In addition to CLIA certification, we are required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories. Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut laws require that we maintain a license and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratories in Pittsburgh and New Haven. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Florida, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. We are currently in late-stage technical review of our ThyGenX &#174; &#32;test for licensing in New York and maintain conditional approval for ThyraMIR &#174; &#32;in New York. PancraGen&#174; and PathFinder TG- Barrett's esophagus are approved in all applicable states. ThyGenX and ThyraMIR are approved in all states with the exception of New York. If we were to lose our CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, which would eliminate a source of revenue, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are also subject to licensing and regulation under Federal, State and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are subject to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, radioactive materials and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the United States by the DEA and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world. Our New Haven and Pittsburgh laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the DEA. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. 

&#8226; 

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such Federal, State and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. 

Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with CLIA, as well as requirements established by Federal law, various States laws and local regulations. In addition, we are also subject to such laws relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical and biological agents and compounds. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of our CLIA certifications at our New Haven and Pittsburgh laboratories. 

Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Diagnostics Tests 

Both United States Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the Federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of molecular diagnostic tests. While subject to oversight by CMS through its enforcement of CLIA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratories that produce LDTs, a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used in clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. The FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion over all LDTs. However, in October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: &#8220;Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,&#8221; which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and &#8220;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests,&#8221; which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing 

&#32;11 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. The risk-based classification considers the LDT&#8217;s intended use, technological characteristics, and the risk to patients if the LDT were to fail. The FDA has indicated in its guidance that screening devices for malignant cancers are LDTs of higher concern to the FDA and for which enforcement of pre-market and post-market review requirements would likely commence before other LDT types. 

Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA&#8217;s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. These requirements will be phased in, starting with higher risk LDTs, following the issuance of the FDA&#8217;s final guidance on this topic. The draft guidance provides that LDTs that are already marketed at the time the final guidance is issued will not be withdrawn from the market during the FDA&#8217;s review process. There is no timeframe within which the FDA must issue its final guidance, but issuance of this final guidance has been identified among a list of the FDA&#8217;s priorities for 2016. 

The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. The FDA will then begin a phased review of the LDTs available, based on the risk associated with each test. For the highest risk LDTs, which the FDA classifies as Class III devices, the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that the FDA will begin to require pre-market review within 12 months after the Guidance is finalized. Other high risk LDTs will be reviewed over the next four years and then lower risk tests, which will be classified as Class II, will be reviewed in the following four to nine years. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that the FDA expects to issue a separate guidance document describing the criteria for its risk-based classification 18 to 24 months after the guidance documents are finalized. 

If the FDA regulates LDTs as proposed, then it would classify LDTs according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Under that system, there are three different classes of medical devices, with the requirements becoming more stringent depending on the Class. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA&#8217;s general regulatory controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials, or general controls. Many Class I devices are exempt from pre-market regulation; however, some Class I devices require pre-market clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process described below. 

Class II devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are generally accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. Pre-market notification submissions are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device (or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance), a manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device or predicate devices and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device or predicate devices with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect the safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device or predicate devices, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. Moreover, in January 2011, the FDA announced 25 specific action items it intended to take to improve transparency and predictability of the 510(k) program. We anticipate that the changes may also result in additional requirements with which manufacturers will need to comply in order to obtain or maintain 510(k) clearance for their devices. These additional requirements could increase the costs or time for manufacturers&#8217; seeking marketing clearances through the 510(k) process. Moreover, the 510(k) process could result in a not-substantially equivalent determination, in which case the device would be regulated as a Class III device, discussed below, or could be eligible for de novo classification available for novel low and moderate risk devices. In the de novo process, the FDA can classify a device into Class I or Class II based on a risk-based determination without the submission of a 510(k) or within 30 days after receipt of a not-substantially equivalent determination. In 2013, several assays and diagnostic tests received pre-market approval through the de novo process. 

Class III devices are those devices which are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. Reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above. These devices are required to undergo the PMA process 

&#32;12 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. Pre-market approval applications (and supplemental pre-market approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) pre-market notifications. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and non-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years. 

A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. These trials generally require an effective Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is exempt from Investigational Device Exemption requirements or deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated Investigational Device Exemption requirements. The Investigational Device Exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after the submission of the Investigational Device Exemption application unless the FDA or the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites place the trial on clinical hold. 

Under the guidance documents, LDTs would also be subject to significant post-market requirements as well. After a device is placed on the market, regardless of the classification or pre-market pathway, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new products, or challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications. 

We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements that are ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes. 

The FDA intends to issue draft guidance to describe general considerations for LDT Class assignment. We believe that our LDTs would likely be regulated as either Class II or Class III devices should the FDA decide to proceed in the way that it has outlined in the guidance documents. It is also possible under those circumstances that some may fall into one Class and some into the other. Accordingly, some level of pre-market review - either a 510(k), PMA or de novo approval - would likely be required for each test. While the data requirements are typically greater for Class III devices, the data required for Class II devices has increased, and it is likely that some amount of clinical data (retrospective or prospective or both) would be required for either type of submission. The FDA continues to review the adequacy of its 510(k) process. It is difficult to predict what changes may result, but it should be assumed that any changes will increase, not decrease, the regulatory requirements. 

Healthcare, Fraud, Abuse and Anti-kickback Laws 

The Anti-kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Law may result in imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 for each offense in the case of individuals and $500,000 for each offense in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Actions which violate the Anti-kickback Law also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government. 

Although the Anti-kickback Law applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payors. Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose 

&#32;13 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. 

In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms "usual charge" and "substantially in excess" are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations. Further, the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. 

We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. These restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 

Persons or entities found to violate The Stark Law are required to refund any payments received pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payor or the Medicare program, as applicable. Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following: 

&#8226; &#32;denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition; 

&#8226; &#32;refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law; 

&#8226; &#32;a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral; 

&#8226; &#32;possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and 

&#8226; &#32;a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's prohibition. 

These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act. 

We do retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of the business. These arrangements as any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. All arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark laws, respectively. There is no guarantee that the government will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA Laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law; and there is no guarantee that the government will not have issue with the relationships between the laboratories and the healthcare providers. 

HIPAA, Fraud and Privacy Regulations 

The Federal government&#8217;s efforts to combat fraud in the healthcare setting were consolidated and strengthened under Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA established a comprehensive program to combat fraud committed against all health plans, both public and private by, among other things creating two new Federal offenses: healthcare fraud (18 U.S. Code &#167; 1347) and false statements relating to healthcare matters (18 U.S. Code &#167; 1035). These provisions prohibit: (1) the knowing and willful execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice (a) to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payors), or (b) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, in 

&#32;14 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; and (2) the knowing and willful (a) falsification, concealment or covering up of a material fact by any trick, scheme or device, or (b) making of any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of these provisions is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. 

HIPAA, along with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as &#8220;covered entities.&#8221; The regulations promulgated under HIPAA govern: the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, restricting the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (45 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 164.500, et seq.); Administrative Requirements for electronic transactions, establishing standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures (45 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 162.100, et seq.); Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, requiring covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information (45 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 164.302, et seq.); and Breach Notification, requiring covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information (45 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 164.400, et seq.). As a covered entity, and also in our capacity as a business associate to certain of our customers, we are subject to these standards. While the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us, and our failure to comply could lead to enforcement action that could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA or its implementing regulations, we may be subject to potentially significant penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. 

In addition to Federal regulations issued under HIPAA, many States and foreign jurisdictions have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. 

Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

Our customers bill many different payor groups. The majority of reimbursement dollars for traditional laboratory services are provided by traditional commercial insurance products, most notably preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other managed care plans, as well as government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. PPOs, HMOs, and other managed care plans typically contract with a limited number of laboratories and then designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. We are currently an out-of-network provider with most payors, which means we do not have a contract with payors to pay a specific rate for our tests. We are subject to applicable State laws regarding who should be billed, how they should be billed, how business should be conducted, and how patient obligations regarding cost sharing should be handled. In addition, if we become an &#8220;in-network&#8221; provider for certain payors in the future, we will also be subject to the terms of contracts (which could include reduced reimbursement rates) and may be subject to discipline, breach of contract actions, non-renewal or other contractually provided remedies for non-compliance with the contract's requirements and/or applicable laws. 

We generally bill third-party payors and individual patients for testing services on a test-by-test basis. Third-party payors include Medicare, private insurance companies, institutional direct clients and Medicaid, each of which has different billing requirements. Medicare reimbursement programs are complex and ambiguous, and are continuously being evaluated and modified by CMS. Our ability to receive timely reimbursements from third-party payors is dependent on our ability to submit accurate and complete billing statements, and/or correct and complete missing and incorrect billing information. Missing and incorrect information on reimbursement submissions slows down the billing process and increases the aging of accounts receivable. We must bill Medicare directly for tests performed for Medicare patients and must accept Medicare&#8217;s fee schedule for the covered tests as payment in full. State Medicaid programs are generally prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule. Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories have contracted with a healthcare billing services management company to help manage our third-party billing. 

Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payors, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payors; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians). We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable 

&#32;15 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems. Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage. 

As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with Federal and State healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments are reimbursed by us. As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payors for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action. 

The majority of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of a write-off of aged accounts receivables due to the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility. In recent years, increased patient responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense. To the extent that health plans and other programs require greater levels of patient cost-sharing, this could negatively impact our bad debt expense. Another contributor to our bad debt expense is clients' inability or refusal to pay direct-bill invoices. We are taking, and plan to continue to take, steps to improve our patient and client collection experience. The remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers. In general, due to the nature of our business, historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete. We subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. The increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information. 

There are a number of factors that influence coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic tests. In the United States, the American Medical Association, or AMA, assigns specific Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are necessary for reimbursement of molecular diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under Medicaid and Medicare, and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. However, the availability of a CPT code is not a guarantee of coverage or adequate reimbursement levels, and the revenues generated from our tests will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels. 

United States and other government regulations governing coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing may affect, directly or indirectly, the design of our tests and the potential market for their use. The availability of third-party reimbursement for our tests and services may be limited or uncertain. Third-party payors may deny coverage if they determine that the tests or service has not received appropriate FDA or other government regulatory clearances, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, or is deemed by the third-party payor to be experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Furthermore, third-party payors, including Federal and State healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, are increasingly challenging the prices, examining the medical necessity for, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of healthcare products and services, including laboratory tests. Such payors may limit coverage of our tests to specific, limited circumstances, may not provide coverage at all, or may not provide adequate reimbursement rates, if covered. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the test. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to maintain our revenue and growth. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. 

Government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical test services. For example, Medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients. 

Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Certain Medicaid programs require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for diagnostic information services. 

The Medicare Part B program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, has been subject to change. In April 2014, the President 

&#32;16 

Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. 

Annual Report on Form 10-K 

signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS&#8217;s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates begins in 2016. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $50,000 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payor data from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, to CMS by March 31, 2015. CMS will post the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payor rates) in November 2015 and the new rates will be effective beginning on January 1, 2017. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates for tests like ours. 

Penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. Civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act provides for penalties on a per violation basis, plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed. 

Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Reimbursement from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately 61% of our consolidated net revenues during 2015. Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called &#8220;Medicare Advantage&#8221; programs. There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements. 

The current position of the laboratories is that they do not meet the definition of an &#8220;Applicable Manufacturer&#8221; under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) and therefore are not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. However, as new regulations are implemented and diagnostic tests reclassified, this may change and the laboratory business may be subject to PPACA as are other companies. There is no guarantee that our interpretation of the law is now or will be in the future consistent with government guidance and interpretation.
