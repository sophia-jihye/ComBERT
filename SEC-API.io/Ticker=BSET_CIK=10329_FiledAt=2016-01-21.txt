General 

&#160; 

Bassett is a leading vertically integrated manufacturer, importer and retailer of high quality, mid-priced home furnishings. With 93 Bassett Home Furnishings (&#8220;BHF&#8221;) stores at November 28, 2015, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories. We created our store program in 1997 to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service. The store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than 30 days, more than 1,000 upholstery fabrics, free in-home design visits, and perfectly coordinated decorating accessories. We believe that our capabilities in custom furniture have become unmatched in recent years. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its delivery. The selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long term relationships with each customer. Sales people are referred to as Design Consultants and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor. In order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers, specialty stores and mass merchants. We use a network of over 25 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share. 

&#160; 

For several years we owned 49% of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (&#8220;Zenith&#8221;). During that time the strategic significance of our partnership with Zenith had risen to include the over-the-road transportation of furniture, the operation of regional freight terminals, warehouse and distribution facilities in eleven states, and the management of various home delivery facilities that service Bassett Home Furnishings stores and other clients in local markets around the United States. On February 2, 2015, we acquired the remaining 51% of Zenith, which now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bassett. Our acquisition of Zenith brings to our Company the ability to deliver best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of the furniture industry, as well as the ability to provide the expedited delivery service which is increasingly demanded by our industry. We believe that our ownership of Zenith will not only enhance our own wholesale and retail distribution capabilities, but will provide additional growth opportunities as Zenith continues to expand its service to other customers. 

&#160; 

In September of 2011, we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with HGTV (Home and Garden Television), a division of Scripps Networks, LLC, which combines our heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 96 million households in the United States that HGTV enjoys today. As part of this alliance, the in-store design centers have been co-branded with HGTV to more forcefully market the concept of a &#8220;home makeover&#8221;, an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the HGTV network. In October of 2015, we announced the extension of our partnership with HGTV through 2019. While continuing to feature HGTV branded custom upholstery products in our HGTV HOME Design Studios in Bassett Home Furnishings stores, we will now expand the concept to select independent dealers. 

&#160;

&#160;

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

We have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail &#8211; Company-owned stores, and Logistical services. 

&#160; 

The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of BHF stores (licensee-owned stores and Company-owned retail stores) and independent furniture retailers. The wholesale segment accounted for approximately one half of net sales, excluding logistical services, during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our retail segment consists of 60 Company-owned and operated stores. The following table shows the number of Company-owned stores by state as of November 28, 2015:

With our acquisition of Zenith on February 2, 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping, delivery and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry. 

&#160; 

Prior to the beginning of fiscal 2015, our former investments and real estate segment included our short-term investments, our holdings of retail real estate previously leased as licensee stores, and our former equity investment in Zenith prior to acquisition. This segment has been eliminated and the assets formerly reported therein are now considered to be part of our wholesale segment. 

&#160; &#160; 

Wholesale Segment Overview 

&#160; 

The wholesale furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number of manufacturers both within and outside the United States who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery and service. Additionally, many retailers source imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture manufacturers and wholesale importers. We believe that we can be successful in the current competitive environment because our products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality and styling; prompt delivery; and superior service. 

&#160; 

Wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2015 

&#160; &#160; 2014 

&#160; &#160; 2013 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Wood 

&#160; $ 93,073 &#160; &#160; &#160; 36.9 % &#160; $ 86,577 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38.7 % &#160; $ 87,935 &#160; &#160; &#160; 40.8 % Upholstery 

&#160; &#160; 156,768 &#160; &#160; &#160; 62.2 % &#160; &#160; 135,831 &#160; &#160; &#160; 60.6 % &#160; &#160; 125,403 &#160; &#160; &#160; 58.2 % Other 

&#160; &#160; 2,339 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.9 % &#160; &#160; 1,585 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.7 % &#160; &#160; 2,113 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.0 % Total 

&#160; $ 252,180 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; $ 223,993 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; $ 215,451 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Approximately 37% of our 2015 wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 42% and 46% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced. Our domestic product includes certain products that contain components which were also sourced. We continue to believe that a blended strategy including domestically produced products primarily of a custom-order nature combined with sourcing of major collections provides the best value and quality of products to our customers. The decline in imported goods share of our wholesale sales over the last three years has been driven primarily by increasing sales of our domestic custom wood and upholstery product offerings. 

&#160; 

The dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet shipped to the BHF store network or independent dealers, was $17,131 at November 28, 2015 and $13,644 at November 29, 2014. We expect that the November 28, 2015 backlog will be filled within fiscal 2016, with the majority of our backlog being filled during the first quarter. 

&#160; 

We use lumber, fabric, leather, foam and other materials in the production of wood and upholstered furniture. These components are purchased from a variety of domestic and international suppliers and are widely available. The price of foam, which is highly dependent on the cost of petroleum, has shown significant volatility in recent years. We currently assemble and finish these components in our two plants in the United States. 

&#160; &#160; 

Retail Segment Overview &#8211; Company - Owned Retail Stores 

&#160; 

The retail furniture industry remains very competitive and includes local furniture stores, regional furniture retailers, national department and chain stores and single-vendor branded retailers. As a whole, our store network with 60 Company-owned stores and 33 licensee-owned, ranks in the top 30 in retail furniture sales in the United States. We plan to continue opening new stores, primarily in underpenetrated markets where we currently have stores. In this regard we are currently considering several locations for new store expansion over the next three years, with at least three of these planned to open in fiscal 2016. We continue to evaluate all stores in our fleet and plan to close three underperforming stores this year as well. 

&#160; 

Net sales for our Company-owned retail stores for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 

&#160; &#160; 2014 

&#160; &#160; 2013 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales 

&#160; $ 249,379 &#160; &#160; $ 216,631 &#160; &#160; $ 199,380 &#160; &#160; 

Maintaining and enhancing our brand are critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores. Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes local and national television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. 

&#160; 

Our stores incorporate a stylish, residential feel while highlighting our unmatched custom manufacturing capabilities. We leverage our customization capabilities by dedicating space in the stores to design solutions for dining, upholstery, home entertainment and storage. Domestic custom manufacturing capabilities make it possible for us to offer a 30 day delivery promise on custom products. 

&#160; 

With the introduction of our strategic alliance with HGTV, the in-store design centers have been co-branded with HGTV to more forcefully market the concept of a &#8220;home makeover&#8221;, an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the HGTV network. Coupled with expanded national advertising on the HGTV network, we believe this alliance will help to increase store traffic and, consequently, comparable store sales. 

&#160; 

To further solidify ourselves as a complete home furnishings retailer, we have expanded accessory product lines including lighting, rugs decorative wall art, mirrors and accent pillows that coordinate with each lifestyle presentation throughout the store. We have also increased our mattress offerings such that our stores now carry Sealy, Tempurpedic and Stearns &#38; Foster branded products. 

&#160;

We own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina, and we lease nineteen facilities in eleven states across the continental United States from which we operate regional freight terminal, warehouse and distribution facilities. 

&#160; 

Other Investments and Real Estate 

&#160; 

Our balance sheet at November 28, 2015 includes short-term investments in certificates of deposit and certain retail real estate related to former licensee-owned stores. At November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013 we also carried an equity investment in Zenith. As noted above, these assets are no longer viewed as belonging to a distinct operating segment but are now a part of our wholesale segment. The impact upon earnings arising from these assets is included in other loss, net, in our consolidated statements of income. Our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year-ends are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; November 28, 

&#160; &#160; November 29, 

&#160; &#160; November 30, 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investments in certificates of deposit 

&#160; $ 23,125 &#160; &#160; $ 23,125 &#160; &#160; $ 28,125 &#160; Certain retail real estate 

&#160; &#160; 3,120 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14,969 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,435 &#160; Retail real estate held for sale 

&#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,401 &#160; Zenith (Recorded in Other long-term assets) 

&#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,915 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,254 &#160; &#160;

Our short-term investments at November 28, 2015 consist of certificates of deposit (CDs) with original terms generally ranging from six to twelve months, bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.28% to 1.00% with a weighted average yield of approximately 0.42%. At November 28, 2015, the weighted average remaining time to maturity of the CDs was approximately seven months. Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within Federal deposit insurance limits. 

&#160; 

We hold investments in retail store properties that we had previously leased to licensees. These holdings, which also include closed store real estate currently leased to non-licensees, are presented as a long-term asset in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of one property which was included in other current assets as real estate held for sale at November 30, 2013 (the property was sold on December 26, 2013). These real estate holdings are typically in urban, high-traffic retail locations. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information about our retail real estate holdings. 

&#160; 

Prior to February 2, 2015 we owned a 49% interest in Zenith. The balance of our investment in Zenith, which was accounted for under the equity method, was included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

Our trademarks, including &#8220;Bassett&#8221; and the names of some of our marketing divisions, products and collections, are significant to the conduct of our business. This is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products. Certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products. We also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The furniture industry is considered to be a &#8220;fashion&#8221; industry subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer preferences and tastes. As such, we are continuously involved in the development of new designs and products. Due to the nature of these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing operations, these costs are considered normal operating costs and are not segregated. We are not otherwise involved in &#8220;traditional&#8221; research and development activities nor do we sponsor the research and development activities of any of our customers. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

We believe that we have materially complied with all federal, state and local standards in the areas of safety, health and pollution and environmental controls. We are involved in environmental matters at certain of our plant facilities, which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be determined, based on the present facts, we do not believe that the final resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our logistical services segment is also subject to regulation by several federal governmental agencies, including the Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board, which are agencies within the DOT. We are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, and other matters. 

&#160; 

We may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods. Labor, environmental, and other laws and regulations change over time, especially in the developing countries from which we source. Changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods. The timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict. Based on the present facts, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. 

&#160; 

People 

&#160; 

We employed 2,237 people as of November 28, 2015, of which 793 were employed in our retail segment, 870 were employed in our wholesale segment and 669 were employed in our logistical services segment, which also utilized another 296 temporary workers provided through staffing agencies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 

&#160; 

We have no foreign manufacturing or retail operations. We define export sales as sales to any country or territory other than the United States or its territories or possessions. Our export sales were approximately $4,516, $4,774, and $4,603 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. At November 28, 2015 and November 29, 2014, we had $4,316 and $4,143, respectively of our finished goods inventory physically warehoused in Vietnam and Indonesia. 

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

Our risk exposure related to our customers, consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with certain guarantees, net of recognized reserves, totaled approximately $23,648 and $18,866 at November 28, 2015 and November 29, 2014, respectively. At November 28, 2015, approximately 26% of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to three customers. At November 29, 2014, approximately 24% of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to two customers. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales.
