 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

General 

&#160;

Recon Technology, Ltd. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a provider of hardware, software, and on-site services to companies in the petroleum mining and extraction industry in China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;). We provide services designed to automate and enhance the extraction of petroleum. To date, we control by contract the PRC companies of Beijing BHD Petroleum Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;BHD&#8221;) and Nanjing Recon Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Nanjing Recon&#8221;). We refer to BHD and Nanjing Recon collectively as the &#8220;Domestic Companies&#8221; in this report.

&#160;

The Company serves as the center of strategic management, financial control and human resources allocation for the Domestic Companies. Through our contractual relationships with the Domestic Companies, we provide equipment, tools and other hardware related to oilfield production and management, and develop and sell our own specialized industrial automation control and information solutions. However, we do not engage in the production of petroleum or petroleum products.

&#160;

We believe that one of the most important advancements in China&#8217;s petroleum industry has been the automation of significant segments of the exploration and extraction process. The Domestic Companies&#8217; and our automation products and services allow petroleum mining and extraction companies to reduce their labor requirements and improve the productivity of oilfields. The Domestic Companies&#8217; and our solutions allow our customers to locate productive oilfields more easily and accurately, improve control over the extraction process, increase oil yield efficiency in tertiary stage oil recovery, and improve the transportation of crude oil.

&#160;

For the most recent few years, our capacity to provide integrated services has been a significant factor for long-term development. We treat simulation measures around fracturing as our entry point for our integrated service model. To date, we have formed new business modules through our own R&#38;D, investment in service-team building and developed an integrated services solution for stimulation.

&#160;

Market Background 

&#160;

China is the world&#8217;s second-largest consumer of petroleum products, third-largest importer of petroleum and sixth-largest producer of petroleum. In the last twenty years, China&#8217;s demand for oil has more than tripled, while its production of oil has only modestly increased. China became a net importer of petroleum in 1983, and, since then, oil production in China has been focused on meeting the country&#8217;s domestic oil consumption requirements. The oil industry in China is dominated by three state-owned holding companies: China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Foreign companies have also recently become involved in China&#8217;s petroleum industry; however, according to Chinese law, China&#8217;s national oil companies may take a majority (or minority) stake in any commercial discovery. As a result, the number of major foreign companies involved in the industry is relatively limited. Major foreign oil companies operating in China include: Agip, Apache, BP, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Husky Energy, Kerr-McGee, Mitsubishi, Royal Dutch Shell, Saudi Aramco, and Total.

&#160;

In the past, China&#8217;s petroleum companies mined for petroleum by leveraging the country&#8217;s abundance of inexpensive labor, rather than focusing on developing new technologies. For example, a typical, traditional oilfield with an annual capacity of 1,000,000 tons would require between 10,000 and 20,000 laborers. By contrast, when Baker CAC automated oil production products were employed in the mid-1990s to explore and automate Cainan Oil Field, a desert oilfield in Xinjiang, annual capacity for the field reached 1,500,000 tons, with only 400 employees needed to manage the oilfield. After the introduction of Baker CAC&#8217;s products into China&#8217;s petroleum industry, Chinese companies have also sought to provide automation solutions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the primary oil recovery stage, oil pressure in an oil reservoir may be high enough to force oil to the surface. Approximately 20% of oil may be harvested at this stage. The secondary oil recovery stage accounts for another 5% to 15% of oil recovery and involves such efforts as pumps to extract petroleum and the injection of water, natural gas, carbon dioxide or other gasses into the oil reservoir to force oil to the surface. Most oilfields in China have now entered into the tertiary stage of oil recovery, at which oil extraction becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient. Tertiary recovery generally focuses on decreasing oil viscosity to make extraction easier and accounts for between 5% and 15% of oil recovery. Our efforts in tertiary recovery focus on reducing water content in crude oil in order to make extraction more efficient.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160; 

We currently provide products and services to oil and gas field companies, which focus on the development and production of oil and natural gas. Our products and services described below correlate to the numbered stages of the oilfield production system graphical expression shown below.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our products and services include:

&#160; 

Equipment for Oil and Gas Production and Transportation 

&#160;

&#8226; High-Efficiency Heating Furnaces (as shown above by process &#8220;6&#8221;). Crude petroleum contains certain impurities that must be removed before the petroleum can be sold, including water and natural gas. To remove the impurities and to prevent solidification and blockage in transport pipes, companies employ heating furnaces. BHD researched, developed and implemented a new oilfield furnace that is advanced, highly automated, reliable, easily operable, safe and highly heat-efficient (90% efficiency). &#160;

&#8226; Burner (as shown above by process &#8220;5&#8221;). We serve as an agent for the Unigas Burner which is designed and manufactured by UNIGAS, a European burning equipment production company. The burner we provide has the following characteristics: high degree of automation; energy conservation; high turn-down ratio; high security and environmental safety. &#160;

Oil and Gas Production Improvement Techniques 

&#160;

&#8226; Packers of Fracturing. This utility model is used concertedly with the security joint, hydraulic anchor, and slide bushing of sand spray in the well. It is used for easy seat sealing and sand-uptake prevention. The utility model reduces desilting volume and prevents sand uptake which makes the deblocking processes easier to realize. The back flushing is sand-stick proof. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Production Packer. According to different withdraw points, the production packer separates different oil layers, and protects the oil pipe from sand and permeability, so as to promote the recovery ratio. &#160;

&#8226; Sand Prevention in Oil and Water Well. This technique processes additives that are resistant to elevated temperatures into &#8220;resin sand&#8221; which is transported to the bottom of the well via carrying fluid. The &#8220;resin sand&#8221; goes through the borehole, piling up and compacting at the borehole and oil vacancy layer. An artificial borehole wall is then formed, functioning as a means of sand prevention. This sand prevention technique has been adapted to more than 100 wells, including heavy oil wells, light oil wells, water wells and gas wells, with a 100% success rate and a 98% effective rate. &#160;

&#8226; Water Locating and Plugging Technique. High water cut affects the normal production of oilfields. Previously, there was no sophisticated method for water locating and tubular column plugging in China. The mechanical water locating and tubular column plugging technique we have developed resolves the problem of high water cut wells. This technique conducts a self-sealing-test during multi-stage usage and is reliable to separate different production sets effectively. The water location switch forms a complete process by which the water locating and plugging can be finished in one trip. Our tubular column is adaptable to several oil drilling methods and is available for water locating and plugging in second and third class layers. &#160;

&#8226; Fissure Shaper. This is our proprietary product that is used along with a perforating gun to effectively increase perforation depth by between 46% and 80%, shape stratum fissures, improve stratum diversion capability and, as a result, improve our ability to locate oilfields and increase the output of oil wells. &#160;

&#8226; Fracture Acidizing. We inject acid to layers under pressure which can form or expand fissures. The treatment process of the acid is defined as fracture acidizing. The technique is mainly adapted to oil and gas wells that are blocked up relatively deeply, or the ones in the low permeable zones. &#160;

&#8226; Electronic Broken-down Service. This service resolves block-up and freezing problems by generating heat from the electric resistivity of the drive pipe and utilizing a loop tank composed of an oil pipe and a drive pipe. This technique saves energy and is environmentally friendly. It can increase the production of oilfields that are in the middle and later periods. &#160;

&#160;

We have received ISO9000 certifications for several of our processes. The International Organization for Standardization consists of a worldwide federation of national standards bodies for approximately 130 countries, and the ISO9000 certification represents an international consensus of these standards bodies, with the aim of creating global standards of product and service quality. We have received ISO9000 certification for the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Nanjing Recon has received certification for the development and service of RSCADA. &#160;

&#8226; BHD has received certification for high efficiency heating furnaces, import burners, and manometer surrogate rendition and service. &#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We operate our business by cooperating with oil companies and their subsidiaries, the petroleum administration bureau and local service companies. Most actual control of our direct and indirect clients can be traced to Sinopec and CNPC, the two major Chinese state-owned companies responsible for on-shore petroleum mining and extraction. We have conducted automation projects for plants in three of China&#8217;s four highest producing oilfields, Daqing, Shengli and Xinjiang. We have undertaken the automation projects at the following locations, among others:

&#160; 

Sinopec 

&#160;

&#8226; Jiangsu Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Shengli Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; The Northwest Division &#160;

&#8226; The Southwest Division &#160;

&#8226; Zhongyuan Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Sichuan Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Jianghan Oil Field &#160;

We provide products and services to Sinopec under a series of agreements, each of which is terminable without notice. We first began to provide services to Sinopec in 1998. Sinopec accounted for approximately 8.85% and 6.82% of our revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and any termination of our business relationships with Sinopec would materially harm our operations.

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

CNPC 

&#160;

&#8226; Qinghai Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Xinjiang Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Huabei Oil Field &#160;

&#8226; Jilin Oil Field &#160;

We provide products and services to CNPC under a series of agreements, each of which is terminable without notice. We first began to provide services to CNPC in 2000. CNPC accounted for approximately 75.36% and 43.09% of our revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and any termination of our business relationships with CNPC would materially harm our operations.

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160;

&#8226; Safety of products. The automation projects we have conducted have demonstrated that our products are reliable, safe and effective at automating the petroleum extraction process. &#160;

&#8226; Efficiency of technology. We believe our technology increases efficiency and profitability for petroleum companies by enabling them to monitor, manage and control petroleum extraction; increase the amount of petroleum extracted and reduce impurities in extracted petroleum. &#160;

&#8226; Ability to leverage our knowledge of Chinese business culture. Many of our competitors are based outside of China. As the Domestic Companies are based in China, we are in a unique position to emphasize Chinese culture and business knowledge to obtain new customers and new agreements with existing customers. We believe that many Chinese businesses, including state-owned companies like Sinopec and CNPC, would prefer to hire a Chinese company to assist in their business operations if a Chinese company exists with the ability to fulfill their needs on a timely and cost-efficient basis. In addition, our knowledge of Chinese culture allows us to anticipate and adapt to Chinese oilfield management methods. We provide our software solutions in Mandarin for the benefit of our Chinese customers, and all of our customer support is available from Mandarin-fluent personnel. 

&#160;

&#8226; Experienced, successful executive management team. Our executive management team has significant experience and success in the petroleum automation industry. They will be able to draw on their knowledge of the industry and their relationships in the industry. &#160;

&#8226; Ability to leverage China&#8217;s cost structure. As a Chinese company, we believe we can operate our business more cost-effectively because all of our employees, operations and assets are located in China, resulting in lower labor, development, manufacturing and rent costs than we believe we would incur if we also maintained operations abroad. We expect these costs savings will be reflected in lower costs to our customers for comparable products. &#160;

&#8226; Ownership of our intellectual property. Because we own our intellectual property, we are able to avoid licensing fees or contravening licensing agreements. &#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Strategies 

&#160;

Our goal is to help our customers improve their efficiency and profitability by providing them with software and hardware solutions and services to improve their ability to locate productive oil reservoirs, manage the oil extraction process, reduce extraction costs, and enhance recovery from extraction activities. Key elements of our strategies include:

&#160;

&#8226; Increase our market share in China. We believe that as the Chinese economy and oil industry continue to develop, Chinese petroleum extraction automation companies will compete with international businesses at an increasing rate. Consequently, we believe we will have opportunities to take market share from foreign companies by developing positive business relationships in China&#8217;s petroleum mining and extraction industry. We will also use strategic advertisements, predominantly in China&#8217;s northeast and northwest, where China&#8217;s major oilfields are located, to increase our brand awareness and market penetration. We aim to continue developing new technologies designed to improve petroleum mining and extraction efficiency and profitability for our customers. &#160;

&#8226; Develop our own branded products and services and shift our focus away from trading business. Our management believes in the importance of our own branded products and our services, in light of their higher profit margins and their long-term significance in establishing the status of our Company in the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the trading business relies on the major clients&#8217; procurement policies toward agencies, any significant change of which could jeopardize our operating results. Our management therefore believes that in the long run we will need to focus our growth strategy in developing professional services for the oil and gas industry in China. &#160;

&#8226; Focus on higher-profit subsection of market. While we plan to continue to provide services to all of our clients, we believe that we may improve our profit margins by focusing a higher portion of our advertising and promotions at those sub-divisions of our industry that have traditionally held the highest profit margins. &#160;

&#8226; Offer services to foreign oilfields contracted by Chinese petroleum companies. As Sinopec and CNPC continue to invest in oilfields in other countries, we will focus on offering our services in these new locations based on our success in working with the companies in China. &#160;

&#8226; Seek opportunities with foreign companies in China. Even where oilfields in China are partially operated by foreign companies, a significant number of employees will be Chinese and will benefit from our Chinese-language services. We believe our hardware and software solutions would be beneficial to any petroleum company doing business in China and plan to continue marketing to foreign companies entering the Chinese market. &#160;

&#8226; Provide services that generate high customer satisfaction levels. Chinese companies in our market are strongly influenced by formal and informal referrals. We believe that we have the opportunity to expand market share by providing high levels of customer satisfaction with our current customers, thereby fostering strong customer referrals to support sales activities. &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face competition from a variety of foreign and domestic companies involved in the petroleum mining automation industry. While we believe we effectively compete in our market, our competitors hold a substantial market share.

&#160;

A few of our existing competitors, as well as a number of potential new competitors, have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our industry or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our primary domestic competitors include the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Beijing Echo Technologies Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;BET&#8221;). BET provides a combination of software and hardware products for industrial automatic control systems in the petroleum industry. BET currently engages in research and development of software and hardware applied to industrial automatic control systems, manufacturing and installation of industrial automation instruments and integration of automatic control products. &#160;

&#8226; Beijing Golden-Time Petroleum Measurement Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;BGT&#8221;). BGT develops analysis software used in oilfields but does not yet, to our knowledge, produce a substantial amount of hardware products. &#160;

&#8226; Anton Oilfield Services Group (HKEx stock code: 3337) is a leading independent oilfield services provider offering one-stop oil and gas field technical development services to oil companies. Its services and solutions span across the drilling technology, well completion, downhole operation, and oil production phases in the development cycle. Its fast growth benefits from the accelerated development of natural gas in China and the Group&#8217;s increased presence in the overseas markets. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We focus our research and development efforts on improving our development efficiency and the quality of our products and services. As of June 30, 2016, our research and development team consisted of 38 experienced engineers, developers and programmers. In addition, some of our support employees regularly participate in our research and development programs.

&#160;

In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, we spent approximately &#165;4.2 million and &#165;6.9 million ($1.0 million), respectively, on research and development activities.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology. The reverse engineering, unauthorized copying, or other misappropriation of our technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying for it. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our technology. We seek to protect the source code to the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. While we actively take steps to protect the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our proprietary rights, such steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our intellectual property. This is particularly the case in China where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.

&#160;

We license the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee&#8217;s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re-sale, sublicense or other transfer of the software. Finally, we seek to avoid disclosure of the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements.

&#160;

Although we develop our software products in conjunction with the Domestic Companies, each software product is based upon middleware developed by third parties. We integrate this technology, licensed by our customers from third parties in our software products. If our customers are unable to continue to license any of this third party software, or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products, we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our software products. These delays, if they occur, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights. It is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future software solutions infringe their intellectual property. We expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets. Although, along with the Domestic Companies, we may disclaim certain intellectual property representations to our customers, these disclaimers may not be sufficient to fully protect us against such claims. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require the Domestic Companies and us to enter into royalty or license agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

Our standard software license agreements contain an infringement indemnity clause under which we agree to indemnify and hold harmless our customers and business partners against liability and damages arising from claims of various copyright or other intellectual property infringement by the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our products. We have never lost an infringement claim, and our costs to defend such lawsuits have been insignificant. Although it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future software solutions or we infringe on their intellectual property, we do not currently expect a significant impact on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

&#160;

We market our products under the following trademarks which are registered with the PRC Trademark Bureau under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. We currently own or have applied for the following trademarks:

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

We have not incurred material expenses in connection with compliance with Chinese environmental laws and regulations. We do not anticipate expending any material amounts for such compliance purposes for the remainder of our current or succeeding fiscal year.

&#160; 

China&#8217;s Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement System 

&#160;

In 1998, China established the State Intellectual Property Office (&#8220;SIPO&#8221;) to coordinate China&#8217;s intellectual property enforcement efforts. SIPO is responsible for granting and enforcing patents, as well as coordinating intellectual property rights related to copyrights and trademarks. Protection of intellectual property in China follows a two-track system. The first track is administrative in nature, whereby a holder of intellectual property rights files a complaint at a local administrative office. Determining which intellectual property agency can be confusing, as jurisdiction of intellectual property matters is diffused throughout a number of government agencies and offices, with each typically responsible for the protection afforded by one statute or one specific area of intellectual property-related law. The second track is a judicial track, whereby complaints are filed through the Chinese court system. Since 1993, China has maintained various intellectual property tribunals. The total volume of intellectual property related litigation, however, remains small.

Although there are differences in intellectual property rights between the United States and China, of most significance to the Company is the inexperience of China in connection with the development and protection of intellectual property rights. Similar to the United States, China has chosen to protect software under copyright law rather than trade secrets, patent or contract law. As such, we will attempt to protect our most significant intellectual property pursuant to Chinese laws that have only recently been adopted. Unlike the United States, which has lengthy case law related to the interpretation and applicability of intellectual property law, China has a less developed body of relevant intellectual property case law.

Regulation on Software Products 

&#160;

On March 1, 2009, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China issued the Administrative Measures on Software Products, or the Software Measures, which became effective as of April 10, 2009, to strengthen the regulation of software products and to encourage the development of the Chinese software industry. Under the Software Measures, a software developer must have all software products imported into or sold in China tested by a testing organization supervised by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The software industry authorities in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and cities with independent planning are in charge of the registration, report and management of software products. Software products can be registered for five years, and the registration is renewable upon expiration. Although some of Nanjing Recon&#8217;s current software products were registered in 2008, there can be no guarantee that the registration will be renewed in 2013 or that the Domestic Companies&#8217; and our future products will be registered.

Regulation of Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

China has adopted legislation governing intellectual property rights, including trademarks and copyrights. China is a signatory to the main international conventions on intellectual property rights and became a member of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights upon its accession to the WTO in December 2001.

&#160;

Copyright . China adopted its first copyright law in 1990. The National People&#8217;s Congress amended the Copyright Law in 2001 to widen the scope of works and rights that are eligible for copyright protection. The amended Copyright Law extends copyright protection to software products, among others. In addition, there is a voluntary registration system administered by the China Copyright Protection Center. Unlike patent and trademark registration, copyrighted works do not require registration for protection. Protection is granted to individuals from countries belonging to the copyright international conventions or bilateral agreements of which China is a member. Nanjing Recon has ten copyrights for software programs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Trademark . The Chinese Trademark Law, adopted in 1982 and revised in 1993 and 2001, protects registered trademarks. The Trademark Office under the Chinese State Administration for Industry and Commerce handles trademark registrations and grants a term of ten years to registered trademarks. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the Trademark Office for record. China has a &#8220;first-to-register&#8221; system that requires no evidence of prior use or ownership. The Domestic Companies and we have registered a number of product names with the Trademark Office.

&#160; 

Regulations on Foreign Exchange 

&#160; 

Foreign Currency Exchange . Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.

&#160;

SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (2008), or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE&#8217;s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used.

&#160;

Since SAFE Circular 142 has been in place for more than five years, SAFE decided to further reform the foreign exchange administration system in order to satisfy and facilitate the business and capital operations of foreign invested enterprises, and issued the Circular on the Relevant Issues Concerning the Launch of Reforming Trial of the Administration Model of the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises in Certain Areas on August 4, 2014. This circular suspends the application of SAFE Circular 142 in certain areas and allows a foreign-invested enterprise registered in such areas with a business scope including &#8220;investment&#8221; to use the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital for equity investments within the PRC.

&#160;

SAFE promulgated Circular 59 in November 2010, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings, such as our initial public offering, and requires, among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents or otherwise approved by our board. Violations of these SAFE regulations may result in severe monetary or other penalties, including confiscation of earnings derived from such violation activities, a fine of up to 30% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign invested funds or in the case of a severe violation, a fine ranging from 30% to 100% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign-invested funds.

&#160;

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.

&#160; 

Regulation of Dividend Distribution . The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends by foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001).

&#160;

Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their retained profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective retained profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

&#160; 

In July 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 37, which replaced the former circular commonly known as &#8220;SAFE Circular 75&#8221; promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&#8217; legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a &#8220;special purpose vehicle.&#8221; SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.

&#160; 

Regulations on Foreign Investment in Automation Service Industry and Oil Exploration and Extraction Industry in PRC. In accordance with the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment (Revised 2007), the oil and gas automation service industries are in the catalogue of permitted industries, and thus there are no restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas automation industry. In addition the following industries are encouraged for foreign investment in China:

&#160;

&#8226; Manufacturing of equipment for oil exploration, drilling, collection and transportation: floating drilling systems and floating production systems with an operating water depth of more than 1,500 meters and the supporting subsea oil extraction, collection and transportation equipment &#160;

&#8226; Exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas with venture capital (limited to equity joint ventures and cooperative joint ventures); &#160;

&#8226; Development and application of new technologies that increase the recovery ratio of crude oil (limited to equity joint ventures and cooperative joint ventures); &#160;

&#8226; Development and application of new oil exploration and exploitation technologies such as geophysical exploration, drilling, well logging, and downhole operation, etc. (limited to cooperative joint ventures); and &#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Exploration and development of unconventional oil resources such as oil shale, oil sands, heavy oil, and excess oil (limited to cooperative joint ventures). &#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had 83 employees, all of whom were based in China. Of the total, 12 were in management, 37 were in technical support and research and development, 17 were engaged in sales and marketing, 11 were in financial affairs, and 6 were in administration and procurement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160;

We do not have any business interruption, litigation or natural disaster insurance coverage for our operations in China. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in China, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Therefore, we are subject to business and product liability exposure. Business or product liability claims or potential regulatory actions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.

&#160;

We do, however, pay certain required insurance amounts in connection with our employees&#8217; wages. The amount and types of insurance we must provide under Chinese and local requirements vary by the location of each of the Domestic Companies. The following table summarizes the types of insurance paid for each of the Domestic Companies: &#160;
