Sources of Supply 

The major raw materials we use include zinc, selenium, zinc selenide, zinc sulfide, hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, tellurium, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, iridium, platinum, bismuth, silicon, thorium fluoride, antimony, carbon, gallium arsenide, copper, germanium, molybdenum, quartz, optical glass, diamond, and other materials. Excluding our own production, there are more than two external suppliers for all of the above materials except for zinc sulfide, hydrogen selenide and thorium fluoride, for which there is only one proven source of supply outside of the Company&#8217;s capabilities, and zinc selenide, for which there are no other proven external 

&#160;

sources of supply. For many materials, we have entered into purchase arrangements which provide discounts for annual volume purchases in excess of specified amounts. 

The continued high-quality of and access to these materials is critical to the stability and predictability of our manufacturing yields. We test materials at the onset of the production process. Additional research and capital investment may be needed to better define future starting material specifications. We have not experienced significant production delays due to shortages of materials. However, we do occasionally experience problems associated with vendor-supplied materials not meeting contract specifications for quality or purity. As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, significant failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of necessary high-quality materials on a timely basis could have a materially adverse effect on our results of our operations.

Bookings and Backlog 

We define our bookings as customer orders received that are expected to be converted to revenues over the next twelve months. For long-term customer orders, to address the inherent uncertainty of orders that extend far into the future, the Company records only those orders which are expected to be converted into revenues within twelve months from the end of the reporting period. Bookings are adjusted if changes in customer demands or production schedules move a delivery beyond twelve months. For the year ended June 30, 2016, our bookings were approximately $875 million compared to bookings of approximately $762 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. 

We define our backlog as bookings that have not been converted to revenues by the end of the reporting period. As of June 30, 2016, our backlog was approximately $290 million, compared to approximately $242 million at June 30, 2015. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, we employed approximately 8,927 persons worldwide. Of these employees, approximately 892 were engaged in research, development and engineering, approximately 7,131 in direct production (of which approximately 858 are employees of Photop in China who work under contract manufacturing arrangements for customers of the Company) and the remaining balance of the Company&#8217;s employees work in sales and marketing, administration, finance and support services. Our production staff includes highly skilled optical craftsmen. We have a long-standing practice of encouraging active employee participation in areas of operations management. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We reward our employees with incentive compensation based on achievement of performance goals. There are approximately 124 employees located in the United States and the Philippines who are covered under collective bargaining agreements. The Company&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement in the Philippines expired in June 2016 and we are in the ordinary course of re-negotiating this agreement. The collective bargaining agreement covering certain U.S. based employees expires in January of 2021. 

Trade Secrets, Patents and Trademarks 

We rely on a combination of trade secrets, proprietary know-how, invention disclosures, patents and contractual provisions to help us develop and maintain our competitive position with respect to our products and manufacturing processes. We aggressively pursue process and product patents in certain areas of our businesses. We have entered into selective intellectual property licensing agreements. When faced with potential infringement of our proprietary information, we have in the past and will continue to assert and vigorously protect our intellectual property rights. We have confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with certain personnel. We require that all U.S. employees sign a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement upon their commencement of employment with us. 

The processes and specialized equipment utilized in crystal growth, infrared materials fabrication and infrared optical coatings as developed by us are complex and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of infrared optical configurations and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to our technology. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled.
