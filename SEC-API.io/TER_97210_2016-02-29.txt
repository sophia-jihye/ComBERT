&#160; Of the backlog at December 31, 2015, approximately 99% of the Semiconductor Test backlog, 93% of System Test backlog, 46% of Wireless Test backlog and 100% of the Industrial Automation backlog, is expected to be delivered in 2016. 

Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Raw Materials 

Our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers. Some of these components are standard products, while others are manufactured to our specifications. We can 

&#160; 

experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items. While the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers, certain items are obtained from sole sources. We may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products. 

Intellectual Property and Licenses 

The development of our products, both hardware and software, is based in significant part on proprietary information, our brands and technology. We protect our rights in proprietary information, brands and technology through various methods, such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; patents; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; copyrights; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; trademarks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; trade secrets; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; standards of business conduct and related business practices; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; technology license agreements, software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, employment agreements, and other agreements. 

However, these protections might not be effective in all circumstances. Competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent. Also, intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes. We do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,100 people. Since the inception of our business, we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances. 

Engineering and Development Activities 

The highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our engineering and development expenditures were $292.3 million, $291.6 million, and $264.1 million, respectively. These expenditures accounted for approximately 17.8%, 17.7%, and 18.5%, of our consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Environmental Affairs 

We are subject to various federal, state, and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. We accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods. However, estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations.
