 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of payment solutions, transaction processing services and financial technology across multiple industries and in a number of emerging and developed economies.

We have developed and market a comprehensive transaction processing solution that encompasses our smart card-based alternative payment system for the unbanked and under-banked populations of developing economies and for mobile transaction channels. Our market-leading system can enable the billions of people globally who generally have limited or no access to a bank account to enter affordably into electronic transactions with each other, government agencies, employers, merchants and other financial service providers. Our universal electronic payment system, or UEPS, and UEPS/EMV derivative discussed below, uses biometrically secure smart cards that operate in real-time but offline, unlike traditional payment systems offered by major banking institutions that require immediate access through a communications network to a centralized computer. This offline capability means that users of our system can conduct transactions at any time with other card holders in even the most remote areas so long as a smart card reader, which is often portable and battery powered, is available. Our off-line systems also offer the highest level of availability and affordability by removing any elements that are costly and are prone to outages. Our latest version of the UEPS technology has been certified by the EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa global standard, or EMV, which facilitates our traditionally proprietary UEPS system to interoperate with the global EMV standard and allows card holders to transact at any EMV-enabled point of sale terminal or automated teller machine, ATM. The UEPS/EMV technology has been deployed on an extensive scale in South Africa through the issuance of MasterCard-branded UEPS/EMV cards to our social welfare grant customers. In addition to effecting purchases, cash-backs and any form of payment, our system can be used for banking, healthcare management, international money transfers, voting and identification. 

We also provide secure financial technology solutions and services, by offering transaction processing, financial and clinical risk management solutions to various industries. We have extensive expertise in secure online transaction processing, cryptography, mobile telephony, integrated circuit card (chip/smart card) technologies, and the design and provision of financial and value-added services to our cardholder base. 

Our technology is widely used in South Africa today, where we distribute pension and welfare payments, using our UEPS/EMV technology, to over ten million recipient cardholders across the entire country, process debit and credit card payment transactions on behalf of a wide range of retailers through our EasyPay system, process value-added services such as bill payments and prepaid airtime and electricity for the major bill issuers and local councils in South Africa, and provide mobile telephone top-up transactions for all of the South African mobile carriers. We are the largest provider of third-party and associated payroll payments in South Africa through our FIHRST service. We provide financial inclusion services such as microloans, insurance, mobile transacting and prepaid utilities to our cardholder base. 

In addition, through KSNET, we are one of the top three value-added network, or VAN, processors in South Korea, and we offer card processing, payment gateway and banking value-added services in that country. We have expanded our card issuing and acquiring capabilities through the acquisition of Transact24 in Hong Kong. Our Masterpayment subsidiary in Germany provides value added payment services to online retailers across Europe. Our XeoHealth service provides funders and providers of healthcare in United States with an on-line real-time management system for healthcare transactions.

Our ZAZOO business unit is responsible for the worldwide technical development and commercialization of our array of web and mobile applications and payment technologies, such as Mobile Virtual Card, or MVC, Chip and GSM licensing and Virtual Top Up, or VTU, and has deployed solutions in many countries, including South Africa, the United Kingdom, Namibia, Nigeria, Malawi, Cameroon, the Philippines, India and Colombia.

Market Opportunity 

Services for the under-banked: According to the World Bank&#146;s Global Findex Database, 54% of adults in developing economies have no bank account. As a result, two billion adults around the world remain entirely excluded from the financial system. This situation arises when banking fees are either too high relative to an individual&#146;s income, a bank account provides little or no meaningful benefit or there is insufficient infrastructure to provide financial services economically in the individual&#146;s geographic location. We refer to these people as the unbanked and the under-banked. These individuals typically receive wages, welfare benefits, money transfers or loans in the form of cash, and conduct commercial transactions, including the purchase of food and clothing, in cash. 

The use of cash, however, presents significant risks. In the case of recipient cardholders, they generally have no secure way of protecting their cash other than by converting it immediately into goods, carrying it with them or hiding it. In cases where an individual has access to a bank account, the typical deposit, withdrawal and account fees meaningfully reduce the money available to meet basic needs. For government agencies and employers, using cash to pay welfare benefits or wages results in significant expense due to the logistics of obtaining that cash, moving it to distribution points and protecting it from theft. 

Our target under-banked customer base in most emerging economies, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, has limited access to formal financial services and therefore relies heavily on the unregulated informal sector for such services. By leveraging our smart card and mobile technologies, we are able to offer affordable, secure and reliable financial services such as transacting accounts, loans and insurance products to these consumers and alleviate some of the challenges they face in dealing with the informal sector. 

With over 30 million cards issued in more than ten developing countries around the world, our track record and scale uniquely positions us to continue further geographical penetration of our technology in additional emerging countries. 

Online transaction processing services: The continued global growth of retail credit and debit card transactions is reflected in the April 2016 Nilson Report, according to which worldwide annual general purpose card purchase dollar volume increased 16.4% to $25.7 trillion in 2015, while transaction volume increased by 14.6% to 263.6 billion transactions and cards issued increased by 8.2% to 10.3 billion cards during the same period. General purpose cards include the major card network brands such as MasterCard, Visa, UnionPay and American Express. In South Africa, we operate the largest bank-independent transaction processing service through EasyPay, where we have developed a suite of value-added services such as bill payment, airtime top-up, gift card, money transfer and prepaid utility purchases that we offer as a complete solution to merchants and retailers. In South Korea, through KSNET, we are one of the top three VAN processors, and we provide card processing, banking value-added services and payment gateway functionality to more than 225,000 retailers. Transact24 and Masterpayment are established, growing processors with experienced management teams which offer a variety of value-added online transaction processing services. Our expertise in on-line transaction processing and value-added services provides us with the opportunity to participate globally in this rapidly growing market segment.

Mobile payments: The rapid growth of online commerce and the emergence of mobile devices as the preferred access channel for transacting online has created a global opportunity for the provision of secure payment services to online retailers and service providers. Our ZAZOO business unit is focused on providing secure payment solutions for all card-not-present transactions through the application of our MVC and other proprietary solutions. 

Despite lacking access to formal financial services, large proportions of the under-banked customer segment own and utilize mobile phones. The World Bank&#146;s research has confirmed the rising popularity of using mobile phones to transfer money and for banking that often does not require setting up an account at a brick-and-mortar bank. The World Bank has stated that mobile banking, which allows account holders to pay bills, make deposits or conduct other transactions via text messaging, has rapidly expanded in Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional banking has been hampered by transportation and other infrastructure problems. The rising popularity of mobile money accounts has pushed overall account penetration from 24% in 2011 to 34% in 2014. 

Mobile phones are therefore increasingly viewed as a channel through which this underserved population can gain access to formal financial and other services. Today, most mobile payment solutions offered by various participants in the industry largely provide access to information and basic services, such as allowing consumers to check account balances or transfer funds between existing accounts with the financial institution, but they offer limited functionality and ability to use the mobile device as an actual payments and banking instrument. Our UEPS and MVC solutions are enabled to run on the SIM cards in or as applications on mobile phones and provide our users with secure payment and banking functionality. 

Healthcare: Given the lack of broad-based healthcare services in many emerging economies, governments are increasingly focused on driving initiatives to provide affordable and accessible healthcare services to their populations. Similarly, countries such as the United States are embarking on expansive overhauls of their existing healthcare systems. 

Through our XeoHealth service we utilize our real-time rules engine and claims processing technology to offer governments, funders and providers of healthcare a comprehensive solution that offers a completely automated healthcare rules adjudication and payment system, reducing both cost and time. 

Our Core Proprietary Technologies 

UEPS and UEPS/EMV 

We developed our core UEPS technology to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the world&#146;s unbanked and under-banked populations. Our native UEPS technology is designed to provide the secure delivery of these products and services in the most under-developed or rural environments, even in those that have little or no communications infrastructure. Unlike a traditional credit or debit card where the operation of the account occurs on a centralized computer, each of our smart cards effectively operates as an individual bank account for all types of transactions. All transactions that take place through our system occur between two smart cards at the point of service, or POS, as all of the relevant information necessary to perform and record transactions reside on the smart cards.

The transfer of money or other information can take place without any communication with a centralized computer since all validation, creation of audit records, encryption, decryption and authorization take place on, or are generated between, the smart cards themselves. Importantly, the cards are protected through the use of biometric fingerprint identification, which is designed to ensure the security of funds and card holder information. Transactions are generally settled by merchants and other commercial participants in the system by sending transaction data to a mainframe computer on a batch basis. Settlements can be performed online or offline. The mainframe computer provides a central database of transactions, creating a complete audit trail that enables us to replace lost smart cards while preserving the notional account balance, and to identify fraud. 

Our UEPS technology includes functionality that allows the following: 

&#160; &#149; Transparent and automatic recovery of transactions; &#160; &#149; Transaction cancellation; &#160; &#149; Refunds; &#160; &#149; Multiple audit trails; &#160; &#149; Offline loading and spending; &#160; &#149; Biometric identification; &#160; &#149; Continuous debit; &#160; &#149; Multiple wallets; &#160; &#149; &#147;Morphing&#148; of other common payment systems, such as EMV; &#160; &#149; Automatic credit; &#160; &#149; Automatic debit; &#160; &#149; Interest calculations; and &#160; &#149; &#147;Milking&#148; / batching of large transaction volumes in an off-line environment. Our UEPS technology incorporates the software, smart cards, payment terminals, back-end processing infrastructure, biometric systems and transaction security to provide a complete payment and transaction processing solution. 

Within industry verticals, our UEPS technology is applied to electronic commerce transactions in the fields of social security, wage distribution, banking, medical and patient management, money transfers, voting and identification systems. Market sectors include government and non-government organizations, or NGOs, healthcare, telecoms, financial institutions, retailers, petroleum distributors and utilities. 

Our latest version of the UEPS technology is interoperable with the global EMV standard, allowing the cards to be used wherever EMV cards are accepted, while also providing all the additional functionality offered by UEPS. This UEPS/EMV functionality is especially relevant in areas where there is an established payment system and provides flexibility to our customers to be serviced at any POS, including point of sale devices and ATMs. Our UEPS/EMV solution therefore expands our addressable market to include developed economies with established payment networks. The UEPS/EMV technology removes the hurdle, often perceived in developed economies, of operating a proprietary or &#147;closed-loop&#148; system by providing a truly inter-operable payment solution. 

Mobile Virtual Card 

We developed MVC, an innovative mobile phone-based payment solution that enables secure purchases with no disruption to existing merchant infrastructures and provides significant incentives for all stakeholders.

MVC utilizes existing and traditional payment methods but enhances them by replacing or tokenizing plastic card data with one-time-use virtual card data, hence eliminating the risk of theft, phishing, skimming, spoofing, etc. The virtual card data replaces, digit-for-digit, the credit (or debit) card number, the expiration date and the card verification value with only the issuer bank identification number (first 6-digit) remaining constant.

MVC uses the mobile phone to generate virtual cards offline. The mobile phone is the most available, cost-effective, secure and portable platform for generating virtual cards for remote payments (online purchasing, money transfers, phone and catalogue orders).

Following a simple registration process, the virtual card application is activated over-the-air, enabling the phone to generate virtual card numbers completely off-line. MVCs are used like traditional plastic credit or debit cards, except that as soon as the transaction is authorized, the generated card number expires once the preset monetary amount has been utilized or after completion of the specific transaction that it was generated for. While MVC has been focused primarily on card-not-present transactions for internet payments in our initial deployments, we are constantly expanding the applicability of the software to incorporate new trends such as presentation through near field communication, or NFC, or Quick Response, or QR, Codes. 

Consumers can easily generate a new card on their mobile phone to shop on the internet or to place a catalogue or telephone order. MVCs are completely secure and can also be sent in a single click to family, friends, and service providers. Once the authorization request reaches the issuing bank processor, our servers decrypt the virtual card data, authenticate the consumer and pass the transaction request to the card issuer for authorization. MVC can be offered as a prepaid solution or directly linked to a subscriber&#146;s credit or debit card or other funding account. Subscribers can load prepaid virtual accounts with cash at participating locations, or electronically via their bank accounts, direct deposit or other electronic wallets. 

The benefits of MVC include, for: 

&#160; &#149; Card issuers &#151;increased transactional revenues from existing accounts, driving more transactional revenues and elimination of fraudulent card use. 

&#160; &#149; Mobile network operators &#151;revenues from payments, reduced churn and opportunities for powerful co-branding schemes. 

&#160; &#149; Consumers &#151;convenience, peace of mind, ease of use and rewards. &#160; &#149; Merchants &#151;elimination of charge-backs and fraud at no extra cost . Our Strategy 

We intend to provide the leading transacting system for the billions of unbanked and under-banked people in the world to engage in electronic transactions, to be the provider of choice for secure mobile payment and other card-not-present transactions and to provide our transaction processing, value-added services processing and healthcare processing services globally. To achieve these goals, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

Build on our significant and established infrastructures &#151;We control significant components of the payment infrastructure in South Africa, South Korea, Botswana and Namibia and we believe that we are well-positioned to leverage our existing asset base to continue to gain market share and build upon the critical mass that we have developed. 

For example, in South Africa, we are one of the leading independent transaction processors, the national provider of social welfare payment distribution services to the country&#146;s large unbanked and under-banked population, the largest third-party processor of retail merchant transactions and the leading processor of third-party payroll payments. We believe that our large cardholder base, specialized technology and payment infrastructure, together with our strong government and business relationships, position us at the epicenter of commerce in the country. Through our national distribution platform and relationships with a number of leading companies across multiple industries, we believe that we can provide many of the services consumed by our cardholders who would normally not have access to these services or would otherwise have to rely on the informal sector. We have already introduced several services to our cardholder and merchant base, such as low cost, high functionality bank accounts, microloans, life insurance, bill payment, prepaid mobile top-up and prepaid utility services. We have a network of mobile ATMs to provide services to our cardholders, and we have established a national fixed ATM network. We aim to increase the adoption of our existing services by expanding our cardholder base and our transacting network, and we aim to increase our service offerings by developing new products and distribution networks and by forging partnerships with industry participants who share our vision and can accelerate the implementation of our business plan. Our core focus remains the development and provision of our technological expertise. We have established significant operational assets to ensure the rapid deployment of our technology. As these deployments mature, we may share or dispose of these operational assets if we believe this will result in higher efficiencies and synergistic benefits where we are able to provide technology to an expanded base of clients and operations. 

Our latest product, EasyPay Everywhere, provides our target market with an affordable all-inclusive transactional bank account with unfettered access to financial services such as microloans, life insurance, remittances, value added services such as prepaid utilities and bill payments through their mobile phones and our national network of ATMs and POS devices. 

We plan to follow a similar approach in the other markets where we have an established infrastructure, taking into account the specific requirements of the local legislation, the composition of the local payment system and the specific components that we own or control. In markets where we do not have an established infrastructure, we intended to collaborate with local partners to provide a similar end-to-end solution. 

Leveraging our new payment technologies to gain access to developed and developing economies &#151;While our business has traditionally focused on marketing products and services to the world&#146;s unbanked and under-banked population, we have developed and acquired proprietary technology, with a specific focus on mobile payments, that is particularly relevant to developed economies as well. Our MVC application for mobile telephones, for example, is designed to eliminate fraud associated with card-not-present credit card transactions effected by telephone or over the internet and are prevalent in developed economies such as the United States. We believe that mobile payments, mobile wallets and the related applications should be a critical component of a payment processor&#146;s future strategy and we have dedicated a significant portion of our research and development and business development resources to ensure that we remain at the forefront of this rapidly evolving technological space. While some of our mobile solutions are more relevant in developed markets such as the United States, we have also experienced significant demand for our mobile payment solutions from developing economies, where mobile transacting is seen as the best solution to rapidly leapfrog the antiquated payment solutions typically available in these countries at minimal cost. We plan to expand our market share in the mobile solutions and card-not-present processing markets by pursuing partnerships or supply relationships with online merchants, virtual card issuers, payment services processors, mobile remittance providers and other online service providers. 

Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities or partnerships to gain access to new markets or complementary product &#151; We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities and partnerships that provide us with an entry point for our existing products into a new market, or provide us with technologies or solutions complementary to our current offerings. Our recent acquisition of Transact 24 Limited, a Hong Kong based payment services provider, for example, provides us with access to the rapidly growing Chinese financial technology market and its participants, such as China UnionPay and Alipay, while our recent acquisition of Masterpayment has enabled access to the European market and to value-added products such as working capital financing for online retailers. In addition, we expect to leverage our relationship with the International Finance Corporation and certain funds management by IFC Asset Management Company, collectively, the IFC Investors, as well as utilize the proceeds received from them to pursue strategic and synergistic acquisition opportunities and partnerships in developing markets.

Our Business Units 

Our company is organized into the following business units:

ZAZOO 

Our ZAZOO business unit is managed from London, United Kingdom with business development support branches in South Africa, the United States and India. This business unit is responsible for the technical development and commercialization of our array of web and mobile applications and payment technologies.

ZAZOO offers an array of products and services that cater for the needs of the global market and comprises of the following key business lines: 

&#160; &#149; MVC &#38; Verification &#151;Our internationally patented MVC technology is a market leading innovation which addresses the needs of the modern mobile payment market. It is the easiest, most secure and most convenient way to pay for goods and services online directly from a mobile phone. Our MVC technology provides a completely secure, off-line payment solution for card-not-present transactions, such as payments made for internet purchases. The MVC technology runs as an application on any mobile phone and utilizes our patented cryptographic card generator to secure any payment transaction. The advent of new technologies such as NFC or QR Codes also enables the utilization of our MVC technology for card present payments. 

&#160; &#149; Third Party Payments &#151;Through FIHRST we are the largest provider of third party and payroll associated payments in South Africa, servicing over 2,050 employee groups that represent approximately 650,000 employees. Our market leading position is due to our ability to move informed money (the movement of money and its corresponding data to third party organizations). This allows us to provide one of the most comprehensive suites of financial services, ranging from garnishee orders to payment modules and collections. We also offer the PayPlus service, providing employees with access to prepaid airtime, electricity and other value added services, or VAS. 

&#160; &#149; Prepaid Vending &#151;Our Prepaid Vending business line handles multichannel distribution of electronic products and services aimed at a variety of markets. Across Africa and abroad, our VTU solutions create a separate revenue stream for Mobile Network Operators, or MNOs, and other clients. The stability and scalability of our VTU offerings enables our customers to facilitate more than 100 million monthly transactions. 

&#160; &#149; MNOs Solutions &#151;We provide specialized solutions for MNOs that boost average revenue per user, increase subscriber activity, and collect valuable profiling data. Our solutions range from Advance Airtime and Mobile Wallet technology to SMS Mega Promotions, tailor-made for each MNO with a focus to maximize subscriber activity, brand perception and profitability.

This business unit has been allocated to our South African processing, International transaction processing, and Financial inclusion and applied technologies reporting segments. 

KSNET 

Our KSNET business unit is based in Seoul, South Korea, and is a national payment solutions provider. KSNET has one of the broadest product offerings in the South Korean payment solutions market, a base of approximately 225,000 merchants and an extensive direct and indirect sales network. KSNET&#146;s core operations comprise three project offerings, namely card VAN, payment gateway, or PG, and banking VAN. KSNET is able to realize significant synergies across these core operations because it is the only payment solutions provider that offers all three of these offerings in South Korea. Over 90% of KSNET&#146;s revenue comes from the provision of payment processing services to merchants and card issuers through its card VAN. 

KSNET&#146;s core product offerings are described in more detail below: 

&#160; &#149; Card VAN &#151;KSNET&#146;s card VAN offering manages credit and other non-cash alternative payment mechanisms for retail transaction processing for a wide range of merchants and every credit card issuer in South Korea. Non-cash alternative payment mechanisms for which KSNET provides processing services include all credit and debit cards and e-currency (K-cash and TMoney). KSNET also records cash transactions for the South Korean National Tax Service in the form of cash receipts. 

&#160; &#149; PG &#151;KSNET offers PG services to the rapidly growing number of merchants that are moving online in South Korea. PG provides these merchants with a host of alternative payment solutions including the ability to accept credit and debit cards, gift and other prepaid cards, and bank account transfers. PG also provides virtual account capabilities. PG offers us an attractive growth opportunity as e-commerce transactions represent a growing component of payments, driven by increased wire-line and wireless broadband penetration, merchants moving online, and the enhanced security of online transactions driving consumer acceptance. We believe that KSNET can become the leading provider in the PG industry by leveraging its existing merchant base and entering into new markets earlier than competitors. 

&#160; &#149; Banking VAN &#151;KSNET&#146;s banking VAN operations currently include account transaction processing services, payment and collections to banks, corporate firms, governmental bodies, and educational institutions. We distinguish card VAN from banking VAN because in the South Korean VAN market, banking VAN is recognized as a distinct service from card VAN. We are the only card VAN provider that also provides banking VAN services. Because the banking VAN business industry is at a nascent stage, the market is relatively small. 

This business unit has been allocated to our International transaction processing reporting segment. 

Masterpayment 

Our Masterpayment business unit is based in Munich, Germany, and is a specialist payment services processor. Masterpayment provides payment and acquiring services for all major European debit and credit cards; and invoicing for online retail, digital goods and content.

This business unit has been allocated to our International transaction processing reporting segment. 

Cash Paymaster Services (&#147;CPS&#148;) 

Our CPS business unit is based in Johannesburg, South Africa, and deploys our UEPS/EMV&#150;Social Grant Distribution technology to distribute social welfare grants on a monthly basis to over nine million recipient cardholders in South Africa. These social welfare grants are distributed on behalf of the South African Social Security Agency, or SASSA. During our 2016, 2015 and 2014 fiscal years, we derived approximately 21%, 24%, and 27% of our revenues respectively, from CPS&#146; social welfare grant distribution business. 

CPS provides a secure and affordable transacting channel between social welfare grant recipient cardholders, beneficiaries, SASSA and formal businesses. CPS enrolls social welfare grant recipient cardholders and, as appropriate, the respective beneficiaries by issuing the recipient cardholder with a UEPS/EMV smart card that digitally stores their biometric fingerprint templates on the card, enabling them to access their social welfare grants securely at any time or place and providing them with a fully-fledged bank account. 

The smart card is issued to the recipient cardholder on site and utilizes optical fingerprint sensor technology to identify and verify a recipient cardholder. The recipient cardholder simply inserts a smart card into the POS device and is prompted to present his fingerprint. If the fingerprint matches the one stored on the smart card, the smart card is loaded with the value created for that particular smart card. 

The smart card provides the holder with access to all of the UEPS functionality, which includes the ability to have the smart card funded with pension or welfare payments, make retail purchases, enjoy the convenience of prepaid facilities and qualify for a range of affordable financial services, including insurance and short-term loans as well as standard EMV transactional capabilities to operate wherever MasterCard is accepted. The smart card also offers the card holder the ability to make debit order payments to a variety of third parties, including utility companies, schools and retail merchants, with which the holder maintains an account. The card holder can also use the same smart card as a savings account.

Our UEPS/EMV &#150; Social Grant Distribution technology provides numerous benefits to government agencies, recipient cardholders and beneficiaries. The system offers government a reliable service at a reasonable price. For recipient cardholders and, as appropriate, the beneficiaries, our smart card offers financial inclusion, convenience, security, affordability, flexibility and accessibility. They can avoid long waiting lines at payment locations and do not have to get to payment locations on scheduled payment dates to receive cash. They do not lose money if they lose their smart cards, since a lost smart card is replaceable and the biometric fingerprint or voice identification technology helps prevent fraud. Their personal security risks are reduced since they do not have to safeguard their cash. Recipient cardholders have access to affordable financial services, can save money on their smart cards and can perform money transfers to friends and relatives living in other provinces. Finally, recipient cardholders pay no transaction fees when they use our infrastructure to load their smart cards, perform balance inquiries, purchase goods or effect monthly debit orders. For us, the system allows us to reduce our operating costs by reducing the amount of cash we have to transport. 

This business unit has been allocated to our South African transaction processing and Financial inclusion and applied technologies reporting segments. 

EasyPay 

Our EasyPay business unit operates the largest bank-independent financial switch in South Africa and is based in Cape Town, South Africa. EasyPay focuses on the provision of high-volume, secure and convenient payment, prepayment and value-added services to the South African market. EasyPay&#146;s infrastructure connects into all major South African banks and switches both debit and credit card EFT transactions for some of South Africa&#146;s leading retailers and petroleum companies.

Financial Services 

We have developed a suite of financial services that is offered to customers utilizing our payment solutions. We are able to provide our UEPS/EMV cardholders with competitive transacting accounts, microfinance, life insurance and money transfer products based on our understanding of their risk profiles, demographics and lifestyle requirements. Our financial services offerings are designed on the principles of simplicity and cost-efficiency as they bring financial inclusion to our millions of cardholders who were previously unable to access any formal financial services. Our latest product, EasyPay Everywhere, provides our target market with an affordable all-inclusive transactional bank account with unfettered access to financial services such as microloans, life insurance, remittances, value added services such as prepaid utilities and bill payments through their mobile phones and our national network of ATMs and POS devices. 

Our largest financial services offering is the provision of short-term microloans to our South African UEPS/EMV cardholders, where we provide the loans using our surplus cash reserves and earn revenue from the service fees charged on these loans. We believe our loans are the most affordable form of credit available to our target market as, unlike our competitors, we do not charge interest or initiation fees on our loans. Our Smart Life business unit owns a life insurance license and offers our customer base affordable insurance products applicable to this market segment, focusing on group life and funeral insurance policies.

Our ATM network is fully EMV-compliant and integrated into the South African national payment system. We deploy our ATMs in areas where our UEPS/EMV cardholders have limited access to the national payment system, or where the cost of accessing the national payment system through other service providers is prohibitive for our cardholders.

Competition 

In addition to competition that our UEPS system faces from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services, there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system. While it is impossible for us to estimate the total number of competitors in the global payments marketplace, we believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is EMV, a system that is promoted by most of the major card companies such as Visa, MasterCard, JCB and American Express. The competitive advantage of our UEPS offering is that our technology can operate real-time, but in an off-line environment, using biometric identification instead of the standard PIN methodology employed by our competitors. We have enhanced our competitive advantage through the development of our latest version of the UEPS technology that has been certified by EMV, which facilitates our traditionally proprietary UEPS system to interoperate with the global EMV standard and allows card holders to transact at any EMV-enabled point of sale terminal or ATM. The UEPS/EMV technology has been deployed on an extensive scale in South Africa through the issuance of MasterCard-branded UEPS/EMV cards to our social welfare grant recipient cardholders. We estimate that we process less than 1% of all global payment transactions in the international marketplace. 

In South Africa, and specifically in the payment of salaries and wages and our affordable EasyPay Everywhere transactional account and our financial services offering, our competitors include the local banks, insurance companies, micro-lenders and other transaction processors. The South African banks and the South African Post Office, or SAPO, also offer low cost bank accounts that enable account holders to receive their salaries, wages or social grants through the formal banking payment networks. 

The payment of social welfare grants in South Africa has historically been determined through a highly competitive tender process managed by SASSA. The participants in SASSA&#146;s tender processes have historically included the local banks, other payment processors, SAPO and mobile operators. Our current SASSA contract expires at the end of March 2017 and SASSA has indicated that it intends to internalize all material aspects related to grant payment and administration, although a phased approach may have to be followed.

EasyPay&#146;s competitors include BankservAfrica, UCS, eCentric and Transaction Junction. BankservAfrica is the largest transaction processor in South Africa which processes all transactions on behalf of the South African banks and processes more than 2.5 billion transactions valued at trillions of ZAR per annum.

In the South African ATM network market, we compete against the South African banks, ATM Solutions and Spark ATM Systems, who collectively have a market share in excess of 90%. 

We have identified 13 major card VAN companies in South Korea, of which KSNET is one of the three largest. The other two large VAN companies are NICE Information &#38; Telecommunication Inc. and Korea Information &#38; Communications Company, Inc. Entities operating in the VAN industry in South Korea compete on pricing and customer service. 

In addition to our traditional competitors, we expect that we will increasingly compete with a number of emerging entities in the mobile payments industry. While the industry is still rapidly evolving, a number of entities are establishing their presence in this space. Specifically identified entities include traditional payment networks such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express; commercial banks such as Barclays and Citigroup; established technology companies such as Apple, Google, Samsung and PayPal; mobile operators such as AT&#38;T, Verizon, Vodafone, MTN and Bharti Airtel; as well as companies specifically focused on mobile payments such as M-Pesa and Square. 

Research and Development 

During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development expenditures of $2.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. These expenditures consist primarily of the salaries of our software engineers and developers. Our research and development activities relate primarily to the continual revision and improvement of our core UEPS and UEPS/EMV software and its functionality as well as the design and development of our MVC concept and mobile payment applications. For example, we continually improve our security protocols and algorithms as well as develop new UEPS features that we believe will enhance the attractiveness of our product and service offerings. Our research and development efforts also focus on taking advantage of improvements in hardware platforms that are not proprietary to us but form part of our system. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain and protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We seek to protect new intellectual property developed by us by filing new patents worldwide. We hold a number of trademarks in various countries.
