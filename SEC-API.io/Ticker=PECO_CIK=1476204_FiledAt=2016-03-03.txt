 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT I, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), was formed as a Maryland corporation in October 2009. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P., (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), a Delaware limited partnership formed in December 2009. We are a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and our wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips Edison Grocery Center OP GP I LLC, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. 

Our advisor is Phillips Edison NTR LLC (&#8220;PE-NTR&#8221;), which is directly or indirectly owned by Phillips Edison Limited Partnership (the &#8220;Phillips Edison sponsor&#8221;) and Michael Phillips and Jeffrey Edison, principals of our Phillips Edison sponsor. Under the terms of the advisory agreement between PE-NTR and us (the &#8220;PE-NTR Agreement&#8221;), PE-NTR is responsible for the management of our day-to-day activities and the implementation of our investment strategy. 

We invest primarily in well-occupied, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers having a mix of creditworthy national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in strong demographic markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned fee simple interests in 147 &#32;real estate properties acquired from third parties unaffiliated with us or PE-NTR. 

Segment Data 

We internally evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio of properties and currently do not differentiate properties by geography, size, or type. Each of our investment properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenue and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. However, the properties are aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar economic characteristics, we provide similar services to the tenants at each of our properties, and we evaluate the collective performance of our properties. Accordingly, we did not report any other segment disclosures in 2015 . &#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221;) beginning with the tax year ended December 31, 2010. Because we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth, respectively, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies, increased access to capital, and lower cost of capital. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We do not have any employees. In addition, all of our executive officers are officers of our Phillips Edison sponsor or one or more of its affiliates and will be compensated by those entities, in part, for their service rendered to us. We do not separately compensate our executive officers for their service as officers. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, financial condition, and ability to pay distributions, and we do not believe that our existing portfolio will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.
