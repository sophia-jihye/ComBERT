 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the aesthetic market. Our initial focus is on localized fat reduction and body contouring. Our lead product candidate, LIPO-202, is a first-in-class injectable formulation of the long-acting &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist, salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved inhaled products SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. We plan to continue the further development of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. We use the term central abdominal bulging to describe subcutaneous fat in the central abdomen what is often characterized by people as a pot belly, a pouch or stomach rolls, among a number of other commonly used terms, and for which there is no FDA approved Drug. We also plan to evaluate the use of LIPO 202 for the reduction of unwanted localized fat deposits under the chin, also commonly known as &#8220;submental fat.&#8221; 

We completed our initial Phase 2 development of LIPO-202 in 2013, showing a statistically significant reduction in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. In 2015, we conducted two pivotal U.S. Phase 3 trials of LIPO-202, which failed to meet their co-primary composite or secondary endpoints as well as showing near identical results with no bias in sites or subgroups. In these trials, AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2, LIPO-202 continued to show a safety profile similar to placebo. We, and expert consultants that we engaged, conducted a detailed review of these unexpected trial results. Based on the results of the review by us and our expert consultants, we concluded that modifications intended to make LIPO-202 commercially ready may have affected the efficacy of the drug product. We have initiated work on a modified formulation of LIPO-202, primarily based on the drug product formulation used in the Phase 2 RESET trial. We plan to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial for the reduction of central abdominal bulging with this modified formulation and expect top-line data in the first quarter of 2017. We also plan to conduct a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to examine the use of LIPO-202 for the reduction of unwanted localized fat deposits under the chin, or submental fat, with this modified formulation and expect top-line data in late fourth quarter of 2016. If either one of these trials and any future Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials are successful, we would then expect to file a new drug application, or NDA, utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which permits us to file an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for us, and to which we do not have a right of reference, and which allows us to rely to some degree on the FDA&#8217;s finding of safety for, and approval of, another product containing salmeterol xinafoate, the active ingredient in LIPO-202. If approved by the FDA, we believe LIPO-202 will be a best-in-class non-surgical procedure for localized fat reduction and body contouring. 

Current treatment options for cosmetic procedures are primarily limited to surgical options, such as lipoplasty, or liposuction for which the FDA has cleared relevant medical devices, and non-surgical options, such as energy-based medical devices, also cleared by the FDA. These surgical and non-surgical options are designed to remove, damage or kill fat cells, and in many cases can cause adverse consequences for the patient. For instance, while liposuction procedures remove fat, they require significant physician skill and resources, involve pain, and require recovery time. Existing non-surgical options are often painful, may produce limited or inconsistent results and may require multiple or ongoing maintenance treatments resulting in longer aggregate treatment time than is anticipated with LIPO-202. Unlike existing treatment options, LIPO-202 is administered in a quick, simple, subcutaneous injection procedure that we believe activates the body&#8217;s natural process of breaking down stored triglycerides (fat), resulting in a reduction in the size and volume of fat cells in the treatment area without damage to nearby tissues. LIPO-202 produces a meaningful flattening of the central abdomen, with results seen as early as four weeks with minimal risk and no downtime. 

LIPO-202 is an injectable formulation of salmeterol xinafoate, a well-known long-acting &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Drugs containing the inhaled form of salmeterol xinafoate have been approved by the FDA and are marketed by GlaxoSmithKline (SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS). Salmeterol xinafoate is used in these drugs to relax bronchial smooth muscle in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Our studies suggest that salmeterol xinafoate also activates &#223;2-adrenergic receptors on fat cells, triggering the metabolism of triglycerides stored in the fat cells and thereby shrinking them across the treatment area. LIPO-202 can be administered by a physician or clinician in approximately five minutes in a specified number and defined placement of subcutaneous injections across the abdominal treatment area using a small, 30-gauge needle. 

Our second product candidate, LIPO-102, is an injectable form of a combination of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate. While we currently have no plans to develop LIPO-102, we may advance our second product candidate, LIPO-102, into Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials for the treatment of the orphan indication of symptomatic exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eye from the orbit, associated with thyroid-related eye disease caused by the expansion of fat and muscle behind the eye.

Our patent estate consists of five U.S. issued method of treatment and/or formulation patents and eight U.S. pending patent applications, as well as granted and/or pending foreign counterparts of the U.S. patents and pending applications. Four of the issued U.S. patents are directed to both LIPO-202 and LIPO-102 product candidates. Our patent directed to methods of treatment and pharmaceutical formulations is expected to expire no earlier than 2026.

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to build a leading aesthetics company grounded in innovation. We emphasize rigorous product development, patient satisfaction and patient safety and look to develop and commercialize products in areas of high aesthetic value. Our focus is on the further development and commercialization of LIPO-202, including for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients and for the reduction of unwanted localized fat deposits under the chin, or submental fat. 

Key elements of our strategy are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Complete Clinical Development and Seek Regulatory Approval . We plan to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial for the reduction of central abdominal bulging with a modified formulation of LIPO-202 and expect top-line data in the first quarter of 2017. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study to examine the use of LIPO-202 for the reduction of unwanted localized fat deposits under the chin, or submental fat, and expect top-line data late fourth quarter of 2016. If either one of these trials and any future Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials are successful, we expect to file a new drug application, or NDA, utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Explore the Use of LIPO-202 in Additional Indications . We are currently developing LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients and localized fat deposits located under the chin, or submental fat. We have identified other areas of the body with high aesthetic value where LIPO-202 could potentially be effective for localized fat reduction, including fat deposits located on the back of arms, along bra lines, on the flanks, hips, side of knees, inner and outer thighs, calves or buttocks. We may develop LIPO-202 for the treatment of one or more of these areas. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Future Commercialization of LIPO-202 in the United States . If LIPO-202 is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize LIPO-202 in the United States by building a focused, specialized sales force targeting plastic surgeons and cosmetic dermatologists operating in the aesthetics market. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand the Global Body Contouring Aesthetic Market Using Injectable Therapeutic Products . Given the favorable efficacy and safety profile and ease of administration of LIPO-202, we believe it can expand the overall fat reduction and body contouring market by attracting new patients who would prefer a less painful, non-surgical and convenient approach to treatment with measurable results in as soon as four weeks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Establish Selective Strategic Partnerships to Maximize the Commercial Potential of LIPO-202. Outside of the United States, we plan to evaluate whether to develop or commercialize LIPO-202 on our own or in collaboration with potential partners. 

Our Market Opportunity 

According to American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, Americans spent more than $13.5 billion on cosmetic procedures in 2015, including approximately $8 billion on surgical aesthetic procedures and $5.5 billion on non-surgical aesthetic procedures. Since 1997, there has been a more than 680% increase in the total number of cosmetic procedures, with surgical procedures increasing by more than 110% and nonsurgical procedures increasing by 1370%, reflecting continued acceptance of cosmetic surgery and increasing consumer demand for all types of aesthetic procedures, particularly injectable and non-surgical procedures. We believe several factors are contributing to ongoing growth in aesthetic procedures, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased Acceptance of Cosmetic Procedures to Maintain an &#8220;Ideal&#8221; Appearance: The American culture places emphasis on an individual&#8217;s physical appearance and perpetuates a lean, symmetrical body image as ideal. A 2015 survey conducted by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, or ASDS, revealed that 50% of consumers are considering cosmetic procedures and approximately 90% of the consumers surveyed were troubled by excess weight on some part of their body. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Growth of Non-Invasive Body Contouring Market. ASAPS estimated that in 2015 there were more than 160,000 nonsurgical fat reduction procedures performed, reflecting approximately 20% growth over the prior year. The 2015 ASDS Consumer Survey detailed the percentage of the population somewhat to extremely bothered by excess weight on any part of the body at 88% and excess fat under the chin/neck at 67%. Currently available surgical and non-surgical options for body contouring are designed to remove, damage or kill fat cells. In many cases, due to their mechanisms of action, these options typically take weeks to months to result in the desired fat reduction, and may cause adverse consequences for the patient. While liposuction procedures remove fat, they require significant physician skill and resources, involve pain, require some recovery time and carry the risks associated with any surgical procedure. Existing non-surgical options are often painful, may produce limited or inconsistent results and may require multiple or ongoing maintenance treatments resulting in longer aggregate treatment time. Unlike existing treatment options, LIPO-202 is administered in a quick, simple, subcutaneous injection procedure that activates a natural metabolic process to shrink fat cells, without killing them, resulting in localized fat reduction with minimal risk and no downtime. 

If approved, we believe LIPO-202 will be a novel non-surgical body contouring solution as the first approved non-ablative injectable treatment for localized fat reduction. The U.S. market for aesthetic non-surgical procedures has grown 605% since 1997, driven mostly by the introduction of cosmetic injectables such as botulinum toxins and dermal fillers. As an injectable, we believe LIPO-202 is well positioned to benefit from the broad acceptance and growth of the injectable aesthetic market. Injectable procedures, including botulinum toxin and dermal 

&#160;

&#160;

filler procedures, have increased from approximately 65,000 in 1997 to approximately 6.7 mil lion procedures in 2015. In 2015, patients in the United States spent approximately $2.8 billion on injectable aesthetic procedures. We believe the early adopters of LIPO-202 will be many of the approximately two million Americans who are already receiving cosmetic injectable therapy. These patients have already demonstrated a willingness to pay out-of-pocket costs for aesthetic procedures, are comfortable with injections and have adopted that modality as part of their aesthetic regimen. In addition to exis ting cosmetic injectable patients, we believe LIPO-202 will also appeal to a broader base of new patients in the United States since the procedure has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile and more physicians are likely to offer LIPO-202 because it does not require expensive capital equipment outlay. 

Limitations of Existing Treatment Options for Fat Reduction and Body Contouring 

Current treatment options for fat reduction and body contouring include surgical options, such as lipoplasty, or liposuction, and non-surgical options, such as energy-based medical devices and one FDA approved injectable drug, Kybella&#174;, specifically for submental fat contouring. These options are designed to remove, damage or kill fat cells. We believe that, continued growth of the fat reduction and body contouring market will be hampered by the limitations of the current surgical and non-surgical procedures. 

Limitations of Surgical Liposuction Procedures 

Liposuction is a surgical procedure that requires a physician to make an incision in the area to be treated and insert a suction cannula to dislodge and vacuum out the fat. The procedure may cause tissue trauma, involve pain and may have an extended recuperation period for patients. The surgery can be done under local or general anesthesia.

&#160;

&#183; 

Complications of Liposuction Surgery . The FDA indicates there are several risks and complications for liposuction, including infections, embolisms, puncture wounds in the organs, serum pooling in the treated area, nerve damage, swelling, skin death, toxicity from anesthesia and fatalities. In addition, ASAPS advises patients that this procedure has many risks and potential complications in addition to those indicated by the FDA such as uneven contours, rippling or loose skin, irregular pigmentation, unfavorable scarring, skin discoloration, bleeding or hematoma, deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications, and possibility of corrective surgery. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pain and Extended Recovery Time. According to the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, a reported 90% of patients experience pain post-operatively and many require pain control medicines, even narcotic analgesics, for several days following a liposuction procedure. According to the FDA, patients should expect pain and swelling following a liposuction procedure for several weeks and even months. In addition, patients may be required to wear compression garments for several weeks to control the swelling and drainage. While following a limited volume liposuction, a patient usually can return to work within three days; larger volume surgeries require a longer recuperation period and extended recovery time. Over several weeks, a patient can resume normal activities but may still show the negative side effects of the procedure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Potential for Undesirable Results. Even following successful liposuction surgery, patients may suffer from skin irregularities as a result of the procedure. One of the most common types of skin irregularities post-liposuction is skin dimpling, in which the skin takes on the appearance of cellulite, causing patients to be dissatisfied with their result. In addition, according to ASAPS, liposuction patients who gain weight after their surgery may store fat in other body areas such as the arms, back or the breasts in greater concentrations. Finally, in one study of women who underwent liposuction versus a similar control population, fat had redistributed to both treated and non-treated areas of the treated women&#8217;s bodies within one year. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Limited Repeatability . The process of removing or destroying fat cells with liposuction triggers the body&#8217;s wound healing response, which leads to the formation of scar tissue in the treated area. If a patient desires further fat reduction or is not satisfied with the aesthetic results from a procedure, the scar tissue in the treated area may prevent the patient from undergoing follow-up procedures to enhance or correct the original treatment results. 

&#160;

&#160;

Limitations of Non-Surgical Energy-Based Options 

In the last several years, more than 20 new medical devices have been introduced to the market to try to address the risks and complications associated with liposuction surgery. Most of these technologies are large footprint, energy-based medical devices which purportedly enable a physician to injure or kill a subcutaneous fat deposit without penetrating the patient&#8217;s skin. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Limited Clinical Evidence of Safety and Effectiveness. Many of these devices have received marketing authorization through the FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway, which typically requires less clinical data than is required for FDA approval of a device subject to Premarket Approval, or PMA, or an NDA (and in many cases may not require clinical data at all). Further, the labeling and advertising of 510(k) cleared devices may not be subject to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny and ongoing oversight as the FDA applies to the labeling and advertising of devices or drugs subject to PMA. Today, the scientific support for many of these technologies is uncertain, with confusing and sometimes limited medical evidence demonstrating fat reduction effects. It appears that other devices are being actively promoted by manufacturers and physicians for fat reduction without having received FDA clearance or approval for that indication. We believe that the wide range of energy-based technologies with different FDA clearances and approvals, potentially insufficient limited clinical data, and potentially unsupported marketing claims has created confusion among both physicians and consumers as to the effectiveness and safety of these procedures. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Need for Capital Outlay and Exam Space. According to our own market research, physicians are concerned about the significant capital outlay required to purchase an energy-based device, which can be well-over $100,000. In some cases, multiple devices may be required to address multiple treatment areas efficiently. These devices may require dedicated office space or exam rooms, reducing clinical practice room space. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Length of Time to Visible Result. Many of the energy-based devices, based on their mechanism, cause the fat cell to be damaged or destroyed and rely on the body&#8217;s own immune response mechanisms to clear the affected tissue from the body. As the tissue is cleared, results may slowly become noticeable and typically are apparent in two to four months. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Potential for Serious Side Effects. FDA data indicates that fat reduction treatments such as cryolipolysis and ultrasound may lead to serious adverse events, such as umbilical hernia, nerve damage, extended and debilitating pain and burns. 

Our Body Contouring Solution 

LIPO-202 is a proprietary, first-in-class injectable formulation of the well-known long-acting &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist, salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved inhaled products such as SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. Our studies suggest that salmeterol xinafoate activates &#223;2 -adrenergic receptors on fat cells, triggering the body&#8217;s natural process of metabolizing stored triglycerides (fat) resulting in a reduction in size and volume of the fat cells in the treatment area without damage of nearby tissues. If approved, we believe LIPO-202 will offer physicians and patients a safe, non-surgical and effective means to achieve targeted localized fat reduction and will become the standard for body contouring treatment for the following reasons: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Level of Medical Evidence . In our Phase 2 RESET trial, LIPO-202 produced a statistically significant reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients compared to placebo over the eight-week treatment period. The safety profile of salmeterol xinafoate as used in SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS for the treatment of asthma and COPD is well-established. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Natural and Non-Traumatic Mechanism of Action . Our studies suggest that LIPO-202 activates &#223; 2 -adrenergic receptors on fat cells, triggering the body&#8217;s natural process of metabolizing stored triglycerides (fat) resulting in a reduction in size and volume of the fat cells in the treatment area without damage of nearby tissues. By activating this natural metabolic process, we have been able to demonstrate a reduction in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat without the risks and adverse events typically seen with current surgical and non-surgical options. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Widely Accepted Modality that Addresses an Established and Expandable Market. Aesthetic physicians and patients are already familiar with and accept injectable products as a key modality for the treatment of cosmetic concerns. According to ASAPS, in 2015, cosmetic patients in the United States underwent approximately 6.7 million injectable procedures and spent close to $2.8 billion on those treatments. We believe these dynamics will drive adoption of LIPO-202 by patients seeking localized fat reduction and body contouring treatments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Patient-Friendly Procedure with Rapid Onset of Effects. Unlike surgical or energy-based device treatment, which can take over thirty minutes to an hour per area, the injection procedure for administering LIPO-202 takes approximately five minutes or less to perform. Furthermore, in our clinical trials, the side effects of treatment observed were primarily mild and transient injection site reactions likely due to the needle sticks themselves. Unlike most other fat reduction procedures available today, LIPO-202 injections are simple and quick, and patients can be treated during their normal day and return to regular daily activities immediately, with measurable results in as soon as four weeks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Low Barrier to Adoption. If approved, we believe LIPO-202 will increase the rate of adoption by physicians due to (1) expanded use by physicians, including dermatologists and primary care physicians, by offering a localized fat reduction treatment without the need to acquire any capital equipment, (2) higher economics from a complementary therapy with cash-pay reimbursement, 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(3) increased efficiency by administration using a physician extender or nurse, (4) higher patient traffic to provide opportunities to upsell additional products and services and (5) simplicity of procure ment through existing pharmaceutical channels for injectable aesthetic products. &#160;

Our Product Candidate: LIPO-202 

Description of LIPO-202 

Our studies suggest that LIPO-202 targets and stimulates natural fat tissue metabolism to achieve non-ablative, non-surgical fat tissue reduction in specific locations using salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved products such as SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. LIPO-202 is a novel injectable form of salmeterol xinafoate designed to produce local, selective fat tissue reduction, or pharmaceutical lipoplasty. We plan to continue the development of LIPO-202, for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. We also plan to evaluate the use of LIPO-202 for the reduction of unwanted localized fat deposits under the chin, or submental fat. LIPO-202 can be administered by a physician or clinician in approximately five minutes or less in a specified number and defined placement of subcutaneous injections across the abdominal treatment area through a small 30-gauge needle. 

Mechanism of Action 

Salmeterol xinafoate is a highly selective, long-acting &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Adrenergic receptors play a major role in the regulation of several processes in the body, including fat cell metabolism. As shown in Figure 1 below, salmeterol xinafoate activates &#223;2-adrenergic receptors located on human fat cells and triggers the natural process of metabolism of triglycerides in these cells to free fatty acids and glycerol. Administering LIPO-202 evenly across the abdomen can shrink fat cells and reduce central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat. In this way, unlike many other treatments which remove, damage or kill fat cells, LIPO-202 reduces local fat stores and the bulges they create without damage to the fat cells or nearby tissues. 

&#160;

Figure 1. Graphic representation of the mechanism of action of LIPO-202 

Clinical Program 

We began the development of LIPO-202 with LIPO-102, an injectable combination of salmeterol xinafoate and the glucocorticoid fluticasone propionate, initially under the submission to the FDA on December 30, 2008, of an investigational new drug, or IND, application No. 102,514 for the treatment of symptomatic exophthalmos associated with thyroid-related eye disease. We additionally submitted IND No. 107,765 to the FDA on March 24, 2010, initially for the local treatment of abdominal adiposity, which indication has been modified to currently provide for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese subjects. Glucocorticoids, like fluticasone propionate, have been shown in the literature and in our preclinical studies to potentially enhance the activity of the &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist salmeterol xinafoate. In our clinical trials, we learned that the efficacy of LIPO-102 was directly related to its contained dose of salmeterol xinafoate without a significant contribution from fluticasone propionate. Therefore, we determined to move forward with LIPO-202, our single-agent therapeutic containing only salmeterol xinafoate. 

Dose-ranging studies conducted with both LIPO-102 and LIPO-202 have defined the shape of the salmeterol xinafoate dose-response curve and identified and confirmed a dose of 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate as the lowest effective dose. This dose was delivered in our Phase 2 clinical trial, RESET, as 20 one mL subcutaneous injections of 0.02 &#181;g/mL salmeterol xinafoate spaced four cm apart on the central abdomen 

&#160;

&#160;

once weekly for eight weeks. We believe higher doses of salmeterol xinafoate were not as effective due to the desensitization or down-regulation of the &#223;2-adrenergic receptors due to increased receptor stimul ation produced by the higher doses of salmeterol xinafoate. This is a well-known phenomenon seen with asthma patients taking salmeterol xinafoate. The safety profiles of LIPO-102 and LIPO-202 are also similar, and to date, can be characterized as benign wi th mild, transient injection site reactions, such as erythema, hematoma and pain. These reactions were reported both infrequently and at the same rate as placebo injections, suggesting that these adverse events are related to the injection procedure itself and not the treatment. 

Clinical Endpoint Tool Development for Central Abdominal Bulging

There are currently no FDA-accepted endpoint tools for assessing change in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat for pharmaceutical products. Consequently, we developed methods of patient assessment and clinician rating of bulging, as well as physical measures of bulging and a questionnaire that measures the impact of bulging on patients. These assessment and rating tools are similar to other rating scales used for approved aesthetic drug products and medical devices, such as botulinum toxins, dermal fillers and Kybella, and were validated using scientific principles and process recommendations consistent with the FDA&#8217;s guidance document, &#8220;Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims,&#8221; in an effort to ensure reliability, content validity, construct validity and sensitivity to change over time. The FDA&#8217;s Division of Dermatologic and Dental Products typically recommends a static evaluation of overall disease severity on an ordinal scale with approximately five severity grades. In a meeting with the FDA&#8217;s Division of Dermatologic and Dental Products, we received a recommendation from the FDA that the rating scales be a static evaluation of overall disease severity and to accomplish this, the global assessment scale should be an ordinal scale with approximately five severity grades pursuant to which each grade should be defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic description that minimizes interobserver variability. We selected a five-point ordinal scale for the patient self-assessment. We then developed a six-point clinician photonumeric scale, or CPnS scale, in connection with our definition of treatment responders according to an iterative process as described in the &#8220;FDA&#8217;s Patient-Reported Outcomes Guidance&#8221; document. Our development of the photonumeric scales for clinicians started with five-point male and female versions. However, in the validation of these photonumeric scales with board-certified cosmetic dermatologists and plastic surgeons, item response theory analysis, or statistical analysis, suggested slight modifications to the individual photos and the addition of another photo would provide a wider range of options to improve and facilitate discrimination between photos. Based on these modifications and the additional photo, the six-point scale produced a stronger inter-rater agreement resulting in greater reliability than a five-photonumeric scale. Therefore, we determined that the six-point CPnS would be a more reliable measure to identify treatment responders to LIPO-202. 

The following is a description of key measures we have developed and evaluated in endpoint assessment trials and in clinical testing: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Patient-Reported Patient-Global Abdominal Perception Scale, or P-GAPS . A patient self-assessment of the amount of bulging in the central abdomen on a five-point ordinal scale, as follows: 

0 = Flat 

1 = Almost Flat 

2 = Slight Bulge, Not Flat 

3 = Bulge 

4 = Big Bulge 

&#160;

&#183; 

Clinician-Reported Clinician Photonumeric Scale . A clinician rating of the amount of bulging in the central abdomen on a six-point photonumeric scale pursuant to which the clinician performs a match-to-sample from two gender-specific scales of lateral profile torso pictures with progressively larger abdominal bulges as shown in Figure 2 below. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Figure 2. Six-point Clinician Photonumeric Scale, or CPnS 

&#160;

&#183; 

Abdominal Contour Questionnaire, or ACQ . A ten-item patient questionnaire on the impact of bulging in the central abdomen, each on an ordinal scale, consisting of the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

How important is flattening of the treatment area to you? 

&#160;

&#183; 

How self-conscious are you about how the treatment area looks? 

&#160;

&#183; 

How much bulging do you see in the treatment area? 

&#160;

&#183; 

How bothered are you about the bulging you notice in the treatment area? 

&#160;

&#183; 

The treatment area makes me look less attractive? 

&#160;

&#183; 

I wear certain clothes to hide or disguise how the treatment area looks? 

&#160;

&#183; 

If other people saw the treatment area, I think they would judge me negatively? 

&#160;

&#183; 

Because of the bulging in the treatment area, I feel self-conscious when wearing certain types of clothing? 

&#160;

&#183; 

The bulge in the treatment area limits the clothes I can buy or wear? 

&#160;

&#183; 

Overall, how satisfied are you with the flatness of the treatment area? 

&#160;

&#183; 

Laser-Guided Manual Tape Measure Procedure . A precise and reproducible measure of circumference at three levels on the abdomen using patient standardization instructions, such as positioning, posture, and breathing, a self-tensioning tape measure, our treatment area grid, consisting of a temporary tattoo applied to the central abdomen, and a tripod-mounted laser level to assure horizontal placement of the tape measure. 

Summary of Clinical Endpoints for Abdominal Bulging 

Primary Endpoint 

The FDA, Division of Dermatologic and Dental Products, has historically defined responders to treatment as patients who show at least a two-point improvement on P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement on the CPnS. Our empirical data defines clinically-meaningful responders to treatment as those patients who show at least a one-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achieve abdominal flattening, on the P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achievement of abdominal flattening, on the CPnS.

We defined our primary endpoint as a co-primary, composite endpoint that includes both the &#8220;clinically-meaningful&#8221; and the &#8220;statistical&#8221; responders to treatment. The clinically-meaningful responders to treatment are those patients who show at least a one-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achieve abdominal flattening, on the P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achievement of abdominal flattening, on the CPnS. The statistical responders to treatment are those patients who show at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achieve abdominal flattening, on the P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achievement of abdominal flattening, on the CPnS.

&#160;

Secondary Endpoint 

In addition to the primary endpoints, the FDA also recommends that for aesthetic outcomes a physical, or objective, measure be incorporated as an endpoint to confirm what is observed by patients and clinicians. Therefore, when developing primary and secondary endpoints, we established the P-GAPS and CPnS methods as primary endpoints and evaluated a variety of physical or quantitative measures in a clinical trial setting as potential secondary objective endpoints, including skin-fold thickness calipers, manual tape measure, laser-guided manual tape measure, two-dimensional, or 2-D, ultrasound, three-dimensional, or 3-D, digital photographic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. We conducted Study VAL-CL-13 to provide an initial assessment of MRI as a potential secondary physical measure of efficacy in future trials, as well as to assess it in comparison to 3-D digital imaging and laser-guided manual tape measure. This single center, single day study showed that MRI could measure the desired abdominal circumferences and volumes, although it was less precise than the laser-guided tape measure procedure even in this highly controlled setting. Study VAL-CL-13 did not address the suitability of MRI as a measure of change over time in a multi-center clinical trial setting. Instead, we assessed MRI as a measure of change over time in a multi-center clinical trial setting as part of the RESET trial. A number of these physical measures were evaluated by us in the RESET trial, including skin-fold thickness calipers, laser-guided manual tape measure and MRI. We used MRI as an assessment in 226 of the 513 patients enrolled in the RESET trial. Despite rigorous standardization of all procedures and protocols, we found MRI to be highly variable as a measure of change in abdominal volumes and circumferences in the treatment area due to both identified and unidentified sources of variability. Furthermore, the measured changes from baseline to End-of-Study in abdominal volumes and circumferences were not different from zero, or no change, in any treatment group, suggesting that abdominal MRI lacks the sensitivity to detect change in a multi-center clinical trial setting. Moreover, the lack of observed changes with MRI was at odds with reductions in central abdominal bulging demonstrated using the patient assessment and clinician ratings and all of the other physical measurement tools deployed in the same study. Skin-pinch calipers as a means of estimating change in the thickness of abdominal subcutaneous fat at a consistent location within the treatment area was found to be directionally consistent with all other endpoints except MRI, less variable than MRI, but more variable than the laser-guided tape measure in RESET. Based on extensive evaluation of these methods for measuring secondary endpoints, we believe that the standardized laser-guided tape measure procedure is precise, reproducible and is the most suitable and appropriate measure to assess the efficacy of LIPO-202 in Phase 3 trials as a secondary quantitative endpoint. At the End-of-Phase 2 meeting, the FDA expressed concern that the observed circumference changes with LIPO-202 measured using the laser-guided tape measure procedure may be influenced by factors such as posture, breathing and flexing and advised us to incorporate 2-D ultrasound as a direct measure of changes in abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness which we believe the FDA views as the key advantage of 2-D. However, as it relates to measuring fat in the abdomen, there is limited literature supporting 2-D ultrasound as an appropriate measure of change over time and for multi-site studies. Moreover, based on the Phase 3 and prior evaluations and , we believe that 2-D ultrasound is not be robust enough to measure change over time taking into consideration the variability and insensitivity of 2-D ultrasound to change. Therefore, we continue to believe that the laser-guided tape measure procedure is the most appropriate measure for LIPO-202 and changes in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat. 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial: RESET 

We completed a 513-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial with LIPO-202, known as the RESET study, utilizing all of the key clinical endpoint tools described above and study design features. Non-obese male and female adult patients who had at least a slight abdominal bulge due to excess subcutaneous fat and who expressed dissatisfaction with their abdominal contour were enrolled in this study. Trial subjects received 20 one mL subcutaneous injections of LIPO-202 in 0.4, 1.0 or 4.0 &#181;g total weekly doses or placebo which consisted of a 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP once weekly for eight weeks. These injections were made into a standardized periumbilical treatment area defined by our treatment area grid with a pre-marked area of approximately 400 cm2 between axial planes at 35 mm above the umbilicus and at 70 mm below the umbilicus, and with each of the 20 injection sites spaced four cm apart. Central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat was assessed on Day 1 as the baseline pre-treatment day, Day 29, which was one week after the fourth set of injections and on Day 57, which was one week after the eighth set of injections. 

Statistically significant reductions in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients from baseline at Day 1 and from placebo were demonstrated with LIPO-202 on the key clinical endpoint measures. The most significant reductions observed in the patients were those who received the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202. We also reviewed p-values, which is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. In clinical trials, the &#8220;p-value&#8221; is the probability that the result was obtained by chance. For example, a &#8220;p-value&#8221; of 0.10 would indicate that there is a 10% likelihood that the observed results could have happened at random. By convention, a &#8220;p-value&#8221; that is less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. As shown in Figure 3 below, by both empirical and historical FDA definitions of a responder to treatment, there was a significantly greater percentage of responders to the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 than to placebo. By the clinically-meaningful empirical definition of a responder, 16.4% of subjects treated with 0.4 &#181;g of LIPO-202 weekly for eight weeks were defined as one-point P-GAPS and two-point CPnS responders compared to 6.8% of subjects receiving placebo injections. This was a statistically significant improvement (p-value = 0.043). By the FDA&#8217;s historical definition of a responder, 6.4% of subjects treated with 0.4 &#181;g of LIPO-202 weekly for eight weeks were defined as two-point P-GAPS and two-point CPnS responders compared to less than 1% of subjects receiving placebo injections. This was a statistically significant improvement (p-value = 0.024).

Figure 3. Significant increase in responders to LIPO-202 treatment compared to placebo 

Using the standardized laser-guided manual tape measure procedure, the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 produced significant reductions in abdominal circumference at the umbilicus compared to placebo as shown in Figure 4 below. The 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 reduced umbilical circumference, on average, by 1.6 cm compared to 0.7 cm for placebo. This was a statistically significant improvement (p-value = 0.001). 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 4. Significant reduction of circumference at the umbilicus by LIPO-202 

As with umbilical circumference and as shown in Figure 5 below, the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 produced significant reductions in abdominal volume in the treatment area compared to placebo. The 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 reduced treatment area volume, on average, by 191.9 cubic centimeters, or cc, compared to 89.9 cc for placebo. This was a statistically significant improvement (p-value = 0.001). 

&#160;

It should be noted that in the RESET trial, change from baseline and change from placebo treatment effects with the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 were enhanced on all outcome measures in subjects who remained weight neutral or lost weight. For example, this enhancement was observed on the P-GAPS/CPnS composites and on the laser-guided tape measure-determined circumference and volume endpoints, despite no differences in mean weight change between LIPO-202 and placebo treatment groups. 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 5. Significant reductions in treatment area volume produced by LIPO-202 

As shown in Figure 6 below, the observed reduction in treatment area volume with LIPO-202 in the RESET study was similar to that observed in a non-drug, limited-volume VAL-CL-10 liposuction study conducted in a similar study population over a similar treatment area. A mean reduction in treatment area volume of approximately 200 cc was produced by both eight weeks of treatment with the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 in the RESET study and by limited volume liposuction as assessed ten weeks after surgery. 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 6. Similar reductions in treatment area volume produced by LIPO-202 and limited volume liposuction in separate studies 

There were no significant adverse events during the RESET study and no subject discontinued the study due to an adverse event; 92% of subjects completed the study per protocol. As shown in Table 1 below, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse effects definitely or possibly related to study drug were mild and transient injection site events, including mild hematoma, erythema, contusion, and pain. The incidence of these adverse effects was low and they occurred with a similar frequency in subjects in both the placebo group and in the LIPO-202 treatment groups. Consequently, these injection site events were considered to be related to the typical mechanical trauma of an injection procedure rather than to the study drug itself. A similar safety profile has consistently been demonstrated and observed upon examination of all LIPO-102/LIPO-202 safety data.

Table 1. Adverse effects of LIPO-202 in RESET 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials: AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2 

Our Phase 3 AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2 clinical trials that enrolled 794 and 793 patients, respectively, were randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trials to study the safety and efficacy of LIPO-202. The design of these identical trials was similar to RESET and utilized all of the key clinical endpoint tools described above in Summary of Clinical Endpoints for Abdominal Bulging. Non-obese male and female adult patients who had at least a slight abdominal bulge due to excess subcutaneous fat and who expressed dissatisfaction with their abdominal contour were enrolled in these studies. Trial subjects received 20 one mL subcutaneous injections of LIPO-202 in 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose or placebo once weekly for eight weeks. As in the RESET study the injections were made into a standardized periumbilical treatment area defined by our treatment area grid with a pre-marked area of approximately 400 cm2 between axial planes at 35 mm above the umbilicus and at 70 mm below the umbilicus, and with each of the 20 injection sites spaced four cm apart. Central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat was assessed on Day 1 as the baseline pre-treatment day, Day 29, which was one week after the fourth set of injections and on Day 57, which was one week after the eighth set of injections.

&#160;

&#160;

The predefined clinical endpoint measures defined for these studies included a co-primary endpo int of the patient assessment and clinician rating of abdominal bulging and secondary endpoint measures that assessed the change in the abdominal circumference and volume. The co-primary endpoint includes both the &#8220;clinically-meaningful&#8221; and the &#8220;statistic al&#8221; responders to treatment. The clinically-meaningful responders to treatment are those patients who show at least a one-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achieve abdominal flattening, on the P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achievement of abdominal flattening, on the CPnS. The statistical responders to treatment are those patients who show at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achieve abdominal f lattening, on the P-GAPS that is corroborated by the treating clinician as at least a two-point improvement in abdominal bulging, or achievement of abdominal flattening, on the CPnS. Secondary endpoints included an assessment of changes in abdominal circum ference and volume as determined by the standardized laser-guided tape measure procedure. 

Neither the AbCONTOUR1 nor AbCONTOUR2 study showed a statistically significant reduction in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients from baseline at Day 1 or from placebo with a 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 on the co-primary or the secondary clinical endpoint measures outlined above. 

By both empirical and historical FDA definitions of a responder to treatment, there was not a statistical difference between the percentage of responders to the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 than to placebo for either AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2. As shown in Figure 7 below by the clinically-meaningful empirical definition of a responder for AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2, 12% and 10% respectively of subjects treated with 0.4 &#181;g of LIPO-202 weekly for eight weeks were defined as one-point P-GAPS and two-point CPnS responders compared to 11% and 13% respectively of subjects receiving placebo injections. Statistical improvement was not met for AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2. 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 7. Responders to LIPO-202 treatment compared to placebo (P-GAPS1/CPnS2) 

As shown in Figure 8 below by the FDA&#8217;s historical definition of a responder for AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2, 3% and 5% respectively, of subjects treated with 0.4 &#181;g of LIPO-202 weekly for eight weeks were defined as two-point P-GAPS and two&#8209;point CPnS responders compared to 4% and 5% respectively of subjects receiving placebo injections. Statistical improvement was not met for AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2.

Figure 8. Responders to LIPO-202 treatment compared to placebo (P-GAPS2/CPnS2)

Using the standardized laser-guided manual tape measure procedure, the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 produced similar reductions in abdominal circumference at the umbilicus compared to placebo as shown in Figure 9 below. The 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 reduced umbilical circumference, on average for AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2, by 0.7 cm and 0.8 cm respectively compared to 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm for placebo. 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 9. Reductions in abdominal circumference produced by LIPO-202 

As with umbilical circumference and as shown in Figure 10 below, the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 produced similar reductions in abdominal volume in the treatment area compared to placebo. The 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 reduced treatment area volume, on average on average for AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2, by 99.5 cubic centimeters (cc) and 105.6 cc, compared to 115.1 cc and 100.9 cc for placebo. 

Figure 10. Reductions in treatment area volume produced by LIPO-202 

It should be noted that both the AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2 trials, the patient assessments and clinician ratings of abdominal bulge and the reductions observed in circumference at the umbilicus and treatment area volume of the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 were the same as observed in the placebo group. Statistical improvement was not met for AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2 in any of the endpoint clinical measures. The observed results of these studies are similar to the observed results in the placebo groups in the Phase 2 clinical program.

There were no serious adverse events during either the AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2 study and less than one percent of subjects discontinued the study due to an adverse event. As shown in Table 2 below, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse effects definitely or possibly related to study drug were mild and transient injection site events, including mild bruising, pain, erythema, and hemorrhage. The incidence of these adverse effects was low and they occurred with a similar frequency in subjects in both the placebo group and in the LIPO-202 treatment groups. Consequently, these injection site events were considered to be related to the typical mechanical trauma of an injection procedure rather than to the study drug itself. A similar safety profile has consistently been demonstrated and observed upon examination of all LIPO-102/LIPO-202 safety data.

Other Clinical Trials:

Special Population Trial: LIPO-202-CL-21 

The LIPO-202-CL-21trial was randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial to study the safety and efficacy of LIPO-202 in obese patients. The design of this trial was similar to the Phase 3 trials. The study did not include the patient assessment or clinician rating tools to assess abdominal bulging as the instruments were not validated for this patient population. One hundred twenty nine obese male and female adult patients, defined as having a BMI at least 30 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2, who had at least a slight abdominal bulge due to excess 

&#160;

&#160;

subcutaneous fat and who expressed dissat isfaction with their abdominal contour were enrolled in this study. As in the Phase 3 trials, subjects received 20 one mL subcutaneous injections of LIPO-202 in 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose or placebo once weekly for eight weeks. The injections were made into a standardized periumbilical treatment area defined by our treatment area grid with a pre-marked area of approximately 400 cm2 between axial planes at 35 mm above the umbilicus and at 70 mm below the umbilicus, and with each of the 20 injection sites space d four cm apart. Central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat was assessed on Day 1 as the baseline pre-treatment day, Day 29, which was one week after the fourth set of injections and on Day 57, which was one week after the eighth set of injections. 

LIPO-202 continued to show a benign safety profile in this study. There were no treatment-related serious adverse effects and one subject discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. As shown in Table 3 below, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse effect definitely or possibly related to study drug was mild and transient injection site pain. The incidence of the adverse effects was low and they occurred with a similar frequency in subjects in both the placebo group and in the LIPO-202 treatment group.

Table 3. Adverse effects of LIPO-202 in LIPO-202-CL-21 

This study did not showed a statistically significant reduction in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in obese patients from baseline at Day 1 or from placebo with a 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202. Using the standardized laser-guided manual tape measure procedure, the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 produced similar reductions in abdominal circumference at the umbilicus compared to placebo. The 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 reduced umbilical circumference, on average, 0.8 cm compared to 0.4 cm for placebo. 

Retreatment Trial: LIPO-202-CL-22 

We initiated the LIPO-202-CL-22, an open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple treatment courses with LIPO-202. The design of this trial was similar to the Phase 3 trials that utilized all of the key clinical endpoint tools described above however it consisted of three courses of treatment with study drug with a three (3) month period between courses. Non-obese male and female adult patients who had at least a slight abdominal bulge due to excess subcutaneous fat and who expressed dissatisfaction with their abdominal contour were enrolled in these studies. Trial subjects received 20 one mL subcutaneous injections of LIPO-202 in 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose or placebo once weekly for eight weeks. As in the Phase 3 studies the injections were made into a standardized periumbilical treatment area defined by our treatment area grid with a pre-marked area of approximately 400 cm2 between axial planes at 35 mm above the umbilicus and at 70 mm below the umbilicus, and with each of the 20 injection sites spaced four cm apart. Central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat was assessed during each of the three treatment courses on Day 1 as the baseline pre-treatment day, Day 29, which was one week after the fourth set of injections and on Day 57, which was one week after the eighth set of injections. We terminated the LIPO-202-CL-22 prior to completion based on the outcome of the AbCONTOUR1, AbCONTOUR2, and LIPO-202-CL-21 trials.

Observation Trial: LIPO-202-CL-23 

We initiated the LIPO-202-CL-23, a double-blind, multi-center study to evaluated the post-treatment safety and duration of clinical effect of LIPO-202 in subjects who completed either the AbCONTOUR1 or AbCONTOUR2 study. There was no study drug administered in this trial. The subjects were to be assessed for safety and efficacy measures every three months for up to a year. We terminated the LIPO-202-CL-23 based on the outcome of the AbCONTOUR1 and AbCONTOUR2 trials.

Bioavailability Trial: LIPO-202-CL-12 

An open-label, crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetics of LIPO-202 and ADVAIR DISKUS&#174; 500/50 (Fluticasone Propionate 500 mcg and Salmeterol Xinafoate 50 mcg Inhalation Powder) was completed in 24 in healthy volunteers. This study confirmed that the 0.4 &#181;g total weekly dose of LIPO-202 administered by subcutaneous injection to the abdomen would qualify for consideration under FDA regulation 505(b)(2). The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway will enable us to file an NDA using the FDA&#8217;s approval of another product based on data generated by others, provided that we establish the necessary preclinical and clinical bridges to the previously approved product. We expect that we will be able to reference data on salmeterol xinafoate submitted to the FDA for ADVAIR, such as that for reproductive toxicology, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, long-term toxicology, clinical safety, QTc interval, and drug interactions, and will not need to repeat those studies. Study LIPO-102-CL-12 showed that 0.4 &#181;g of LIPO-202 injected subcutaneously into the abdomen produces 

&#160;

&#160;

peak plasma levels of salmeterol significantly below to those produced by 100 &#181;g of salmeterol xinafoate administered daily by the oral inhalation of ADVAIR. 

Summary of Early Clinical Trials 

Each of our clinical trials to date has provided important information on the safety and efficacy of LIPO-202, as well as on the tools with which to assess changes in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat. All of the clinical trials of LIPO-102 and LIPO-202 conducted prior to the RESET Study, as well as several key endpoint evaluation studies, are described below. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study LIPO-102-CL-01 . A single- and multiple-dose Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetics study, which included 26 patients, identified the maximum potential dose of salmeterol xinafoate administered by subcutaneous injection to the abdomen that would qualify for consideration under FDA regulation 505(b)(2). The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway will enable us to file an NDA using the FDA&#8217;s approval of another product based on data generated by others, provided that we establish the necessary preclinical and clinical bridges to the previously approved product. We expect that we will be able to reference data on salmeterol xinafoate submitted to the FDA for ADVAIR, such as that for reproductive toxicology, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, long-term toxicology, clinical safety, QTc interval, and drug interactions, and will not need to repeat those studies. Study LIPO-102-CL-01 showed that approximately 50 &#181;g of salmeterol xinafoate injected subcutaneously into the abdomen produces peak plasma levels of salmeterol comparable to those produced by 50 &#181;g of salmeterol xinafoate administered twice daily by the oral inhalation of ADVAIR. Thus, guidance was obtained for future trials on the limits of salmeterol xinafoate dosing when injected subcutaneously into the abdomen. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study LIPO-102-CL-03 . This study, which included 54 patients, provided initial information on the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of LIPO-102 administered via subcutaneous injection once or twice per week for four weeks to non-obese patients with measureable abdominal bulging. This study demonstrated that the greatest reduction in abdominal circumference was produced by the lowest dose of LIPO-102 tested, 0.5 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate and 1.0 &#181;g fluticasone propionate, that was administered once rather than twice weekly for four weeks. This study also demonstrated that 2-D ultrasound and skin-pinch calipers were highly variable as assessment tools relative to constant-tension tape measurement. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study LIPO-102-CL-04. This study, which included 58 patients, further defined the dose of LIPO-102 when injected as divided doses in a defined array across the abdomen. Two doses of LIPO-102 were compared to placebo when administered as 22 one mL central abdominal subcutaneous injections once a week for eight weeks. The use of 3-D digital photographic imaging to measure changes in abdominal circumference and volume, as well as patient and clinician rating scales were investigated in this trial as potential clinical endpoints. The lowest doses of salmeterol xinafoate in LIPO-102 produced superior efficacy compared to the higher doses. The pharmacokinetics of LIPO-102 at a total weekly salmeterol xinafoate plus fluticasone propionate dose of 11 &#181;g+22 &#181;g was also evaluated in Study LIPO-102-CL-04 after the first dose on Day 1 and after the last dose on Day 50. There was no significant difference between the plasma levels of either dose on Days 1 and 50. The peak plasma level of salmeterol xinafoate produced by LIPO-102 was approximately one fifth of that produced by the 505(b)(2) reference drug ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50. Moreover, the peak plasma level of salmeterol xinafoate produced by the Phase 3 dose of LIPO-202, or 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate total weekly dose, is approximately over 100-fold less than that produced by the 505(b)(2) reference drug ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50. The reductions in abdominal circumference and volume determined by 3-D digital imaging were also found to persist in responders to LIPO-102 for 12-weeks post-treatment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study LIPO-102-CL-09. This study, which included 157 patients, was designed to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

define the optimal dose of LIPO-102 through an evaluation of the safety and efficacy of three doses of LIPO-102 compared to placebo delivered as 20 subcutaneous injections once a week for eight weeks; 

&#160;

&#183; 

test the Patient Photonumeric Scale, or PPnS, and CPnS, as potential clinical endpoints; 

&#160;

&#183; 

test the Abdominal Subcutaneous Adiposity Questionnaires, or ASAQ, now renamed the Abdominal Contour Questionnaire, or ACQ, as a clinical endpoint; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

evaluate the safety and efficacy of LIPO-102 for 12 weeks following the final dose. 

Toward the stated objectives, a weekly dose of 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate and 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate LIPO-102 was identified as optimal based on significant reductions in treatment area volume and circumference as determined by 3-D digital imaging. LIPO-102-treated subjects in the 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate + 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate LIPO-102 and 1.0 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate + 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate LIPO-102 dose groups rated the change in abdominal flattening on the PPnS as significantly greater by End-of-Study compared with the placebo group (p-value = 0.044 and p-value = 0.006, respectively), with similar trends observed on the CPnS. The ASAQ was confirmed to be a valid patient-reported outcome instrument to measure the broader effects or impact of changes in central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat. Importantly, the lowest dose of LIPO-102 tested, 0.1 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate + 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate, was inactive/no different than placebo across all outcome measures in this study. Similar to the prior study, in the non-drug observational follow-on to LIPO-102-CL-09, the reduction in abdominal circumference and volume produced by responders to 0.4 &#181;g 

&#160;

&#160;

salmeterol xinafoate + 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate LIPO-1 02 remained significantly greater than that produced by placebo for at least six weeks post-treatment and remained above baseline and placebo for at least 12 weeks post-treatment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study VAL-CL-10. This study enrolled 23 subjects who met the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as in Study LIPO-102-CL-09, but received only limited volume liposuction performed over the same treatment area in Study LIPO-102-CL-09. Acknowledging that these are cross-study comparisons, the VAL-CL-10 study showed that the reductions in abdominal circumference and volume measured ten weeks after liposuction were nearly identical to those produced by 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate + 20 &#181;g fluticasone propionate LIPO-102 in Study LIPO-102-CL-09. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study LIPO-102-CL-11. In contrast to all previous studies with LIPO-102, this study, which included 228 patients, compared the safety and efficacy of three doses of LIPO-102 in which the dose of salmeterol xinafoate was fixed and dose of fluticasone propionate was varied. In addition, this clinical trial included a treatment arm of 0.4 &#181;g salmeterol xinafoate alone, or LIPO-202. The LIPO-102 dose-response was relatively flat in terms of change from baseline to End-of-Study for most outcome measures, regardless of the contained dose of fluticasone propionate. In addition, the responses for salmeterol xinafoate alone, or LIPO-202, were similar to those of the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate, or LIPO-102. These results confirmed that salmeterol xinafoate alone is primarily responsible for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat, prompting us to focus on LIPO-202 for future development. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study VAL-CL-13. This study was an exploratory study that compared MRI with external 3-D digital stereophotogrammetry and a laser-guided manual tape measure procedure as objective physical measures of abdominal circumference. One male and one female subject completed the study from each of the following BMI categories: BMI = 20 &#177; 2 kg/m 2 , 25 &#177; 2 kg/m 2 , 30 &#177; 2 kg/m 2 and 35 &#177; 2 kg/m 2 . This study showed that MRI, 3-D digital imaging and the standardized laser-guided manual tape measure procedure were all effective tools for measuring abdominal circumferences in this single site, single visit study. However, variance was found to be the smallest for the laser-guided manual tape measure procedure warranting further evaluation of this technique in future clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Studies VAL-CL-15 and VAL-CL-20. These studies, which included 29 subjects and 30 subjects, respectively, and 10 clinicians and 11 clinicians, respectively, were non-drug studies that assessed the reliability of our clinical outcome assessment rating instruments, including the P-GAPS, Clinician-Global Abdominal Perception Scale, or C-GAPS, PPnS, CPnS. The ratings were performed by trained clinical raters of the studies, on two occasions 14 days apart to provide an estimate of test-retest reliability. In addition, the inter-rater reliability, or the degree of agreement among the raters, was determined for the clinician rating instruments, such as the C-GAPS and CPnS. An intra-class correlation coefficient, or ICC, is typically determined to estimate reliability when there are a number of different raters making an assessment. When the raters agree on an assessment, the ICC approaches a value of one. The ICC from all studies for all clinical outcome assessment or rating instruments approached or exceeded 0.9. These studies demonstrated a high degree of patient, clinician and test-retest reliability for our clinical outcome assessment instruments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study VAL-CL-24 . This non-drug study included 40 subjects and explored 2-D ultrasound as a tool to measure subcutaneous fat thickness in the anterior abdomen and determined the intra- and inter-rater reliability and retest reliability of 2-D ultrasound at two investigative clinical sites. The intra- and inter-rater reliability and retest reliability was also determined for our laser-guided tape measure procedure. This study achieved its intended purpose of establishing the protocol with which to assess 2-D ultrasound as a measure of change in up to four clinical sites in the two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. 

Our Product Candidate: LIPO-102 

While we currently have no plans to develop LIPO-102, we may advance our second product candidate, LIPO-102, into Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials for the treatment of the orphan indication of symptomatic exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eye from the orbit, associated with thyroid-related eye disease caused by the expansion of fat and muscle behind the eye. 

Nonclinical Program 

Pharmacology 

Salmeterol xinafoate is a highly selective, long-acting &#223; 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist. Consistent with the known role of &#223;-adrenergic receptors in the metabolism of stored triglycerides in fat cells, we have shown that salmeterol xinafoate stimulates the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol in cultured human fat cells in a manner similar to other &#223;-adrenergic receptor agonists, such as isoproterenol. We have also direct evidence that the injection of salmeterol xinafoate reduces central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in animal models as our pre-clinical studies demonstrated that the injection of salmeterol xinafoate into the inguinal fat pad of rats produced a dose-related reduction in fat pad weight. Similarly, our preclinical studies demonstrated that the injection of salmeterol xinafoate into the back fat of minipigs reduced subcutaneous fat thickness as determined by 2-D ultrasound. 

&#160;

&#160;

Safety 

Salmeterol xinafoate is approved by the FDA for use by oral inhalation for maintenance treatment of bronchial asthma and COPD either alone as the active ingredient of SEREVENT DISKUS or in combination with another active ingredient, fluticasone propionate, as ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. Consequently, the nonclinical safety profile of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate alone and in combination has been extensively studied in mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and/or dogs by several routes of administration, including by mouth, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, inhalation and/or dermal. The FDA&#8217;s findings as to this information are available for us to reference in our NDA under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway provided that we establish the appropriate preclinical bridge to that data. Although salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate are established agents with well characterized nonclinical and clinical safety profiles, both systemically and locally, use of these drugs by the subcutaneous route and their potential properties to stimulate the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol are less well understood and have been the focus of our studies. Consequently, additional pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies were conducted in rats and minipigs by subcutaneous administration to assess local tolerability in support of early stage clinical trials. Local concentrations of salmeterol xinafoate 2500-fold greater than the anticipated clinical dose produced no untoward histopathological changes when injected into the back fat of minipigs. These findings have recently been extended; subcutaneous administration of salmeterol xinafoate into the back fat of minipigs 3 times per week for 13 weeks produced no untoward histopathological changes at local concentrations of salmeterol xinafoate 15,000-fold greater than the anticipated clinical dose. In addition, the preclinical bridge to the SEREVENT/ADVAIR preclinical safety data, under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, was established in a 28-day study in rats comparing oral and subcutaneous administration of salmeterol xinafoate.

Government Regulation 

Pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as LIPO-202. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

United States Regulation of Drugs. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs such as our product candidates under the FDCA and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory strategy, explained further below, which we expect will allow us to rely in our new drug application, NDA, on certain nonclinical and clinical safety findings made by the FDA in its approval of salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved products such as SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. 

The U.S. Drug Approval Process . New drugs must be approved by the FDA before they can be marketed. There are three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (a Section 505(b)(1) application); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (a Section 505(b)(2) application); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is, among other things, the same as a previously approved product in terms of its active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, and pharmacokinetics (a Section 505(j) application, referred to as an abbreviated new drug application or ANDA). 

The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States under Section 505(b) generally include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices or GLP; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence in the United States (the sponsor may also elect to conduct foreign clinical trials under an IND, and if it does elect to do so, all FDA requirements must be followed); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication (the FDA will accept non-IND foreign studies as support for an FDA application provided the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if necessary); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA acceptance of the NDA for review; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

responding to questions raised by the FDA regarding the application (&#8220;complete response&#8221; letters), if any; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the FDA&#8217;s approval of the NDA. 

As noted above, we plan to pursue the 505(b)(2) approval pathway, which is an option for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information demonstrating safety or effectiveness comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. This can include allowing the applicant to rely indirectly upon the FDA&#8217;s findings with regard to the adequacy of certain preclinical or clinical data in demonstrating the safety or effectiveness of an approved product to which the proposed product is similar. Such an application may be appropriate if an applicant is seeking approval of a product that contains the same active ingredient as an already-approved product, but in a different strength or dosage form, or for a different indication. The FDA typically requires a 505(b)(2) NDA applicant to perform additional testing, which can be extensive and include clinical trials, to support the change from the approved product. 

Regardless of the path taken, the U.S. drug testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval are uncertain and may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials or impose other conditions at any time on various grounds, including that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with regulatory or IRB requirements. 

Based on our interactions with the FDA, we believe that, if we successfully complete our Phase 3 program, we will have completed the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2). 

Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless prior to that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the FDA may place the clinical trial on a clinical hold, and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical Trials . &#160; Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial before the trial may commence. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The IRB must also monitor the trial until completed. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects and dosage tolerance, and/or absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. If possible, Phase 1 clinical trials may also test for early evidence of effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will progress to Phase 3 clinical trials, in which the product candidate will be administered to an expanded patient population with the target condition, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, including where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful e ffect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. &#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

Marketing Application . &#160; Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product and the proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application generally must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. If the FDA requests additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is again subject to filing review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 

Also, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must generally contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Based on early indications from the FDA, we do not anticipate that the FDA would grant a full waiver for LIPO-202 and may have to conduct some pediatric studies, perhaps on a deferred or partial waiver basis. 

Review of Application . &#160; Once the NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review and sets a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten months of the application&#8217;s receipt (except where the application includes a new molecular entity, i.e., an active moiety not previously approved, in which case the review goal is ten months from the 60 day filing date). The FDA&#8217;s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six months of receipt (except where the application includes a new molecular entity, in which case the review goal is six months from the 60 day filing date). The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMP. The FDA may also inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements. 

During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug&#8217;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval, and can 

&#160;

&#160;

materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. The FDA may also refer the application to an advis ory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, the agency issues either an approval letter or, if the review cycle is complete and the application is not ready for approval, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if the sponsor submits this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Post-Approval Requirements. Once an NDA is approved, the product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to manufacturing, drug listing and establishment registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, as well as some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety or effectiveness, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 

In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Further, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes new obligations that require prescription drugs distributed in the United States to be traced throughout the supply chain. A number of states also require the licensing of pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers, and as a result pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional oversight at the state level. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market study or clinical trial requirements to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Advertising and Promotion . &#160; The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The FDA considers off-label promotion to &#8220;misbrand&#8221; a drug. Pharmaceutical companies have paid millions and even billions of dollars to resolve government allegations of off-label promotion, including allegations that such off-label promotion led to violations of the False Claims Act. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments. &#160; &#160; As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to for mulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-W axman Act, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applican t can establish that reliance on the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, including by providing data or information that &#8220;bridge&#8221; the differences between the proposed product and the already-approved product, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved bra nded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory strategy, which we expect will allow us to rely on our NDA filing on certain nonclinical and clinical safety findings made by the FDA in its approval of salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved products such as SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. We believe that if we successfully complete our Phase 3 clinical trial, we will have completed the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) to support the approval of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. 

By pursuing the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for LIPO-202, our reliance on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety from salmeterol xinafoate may require any approved labeling for LIPO-202 to include, in addition to safety information from our clinical trials, certain safety information that is included in the label for approved salmeterol xinafoate products, including warnings and other safety information. Similarly, using the 505(b)(2) pathway may require us to include certifications with our NDA submission for any patents that are listed with the reference drug product in the Orange Book. 

Orange Book Listing. &#160; &#160; In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant is required to list with the FDA patents that claim the drug substance, drug product, or the proposed method of using the drug. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application is published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the reference drug product has been submitted to the FDA, referred to as a Paragraph I Certification; (2) such patent has expired, referred to as a Paragraph II Certification; (3) the date on which such patent expires, referred to as a Paragraph III Certification; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted, referred to as a Paragraph IV Certification. With regard to a method of use patent, the applicant may submit a &#8220;section viii&#8221; statement stating that the proposed product&#8217;s label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the method of use claimed in the patent. By submitting a Paragraph III Certification, an applicant is stating that it is not seeking approval before expiration of the patent. An applicant submitting a Paragraph IV Certification must provide notice to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA refers. If within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV Certification notice, the reference NDA holder or patent owner responds by filing a lawsuit asserting patent infringement, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of thirty months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, a judgment in the lawsuit that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or a settlement of the lawsuit that includes a finding that the patent was invalid or not infringed. 

Non-Patent Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products. &#160; &#160; A 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug, described below, has expired. Regulatory exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#8220;active moiety&#8221; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety, except that the FDA may accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for filing after four years if the application contains a Paragraph IV Certification. In instances of a four year filing, if the reference product sponsor timely sues on the patent, approval of the proposed product cannot occur until expiration of seven and a half years from the approval date of the reference product, unless the patent expires, there is a judgment in the lawsuit that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or a settlement of the lawsuit that includes a finding that the patent was invalid or not infringed. 

A drug that is not an NCE, including one approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval (often a change from a marketed product, such as a new formulation, dosage form, or indication), if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. During this three-year period of exclusivity, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a product with the same condition of approval, but the agency is not precluded from accepting the application and reviewing it. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity . &#160; The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or affects 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that sales of a product to treat the disease or condition will allow recovery of the cost of developing the drug and making it available in the United States. A request for orphan 

&#160;

&#160;

designation must be submitted before the NDA for the product is submitted. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and has a medically plausible basis for expecting the drug to be effective in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of that disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan indication. After granting orphan drug designation, the FDA publicly discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but the product is eligible for research grants and tax credits and, if approv ed, orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for the orphan designated disease or condition, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which generally prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active moiety for the same indication. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product with the same moiety for the same use if the subsequent product is clinically superior to the approved product, as demonstrated by better effectiveness or safety, or by making a major contribution to patient care. Orphan exclusivity also does not bar approval of a different drug for the same orphan indication, or approval of the sam e drug for a different indication, nor does it prevent approval of the same drug for the same use if the manufacturer of the approved product cannot meet market demand. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Also, if a competitor obtains orphan exclusivity for a product that has the same active moiety and is approved for the same orphan designated use as one of our product candidates before we do, our product could be blocked f rom approval. 

Foreign Regulation. &#160; &#160; In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, and if approved, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Physician Payment Transparency Laws . &#160; In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws and regulations could restrict our business practices. These laws and regulations include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws typically relate to a service or item that is paid for in whole or in part by a government healthcare program or private third-party payor. Although we anticipate it would be extremely rare, if ever, that third-party payors would pay in whole or in part for our product candidates currently in development or related procedures, the government is known to look broadly for any connection to government dollars when enforcing healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Further, many states have adopted similar state laws and regulations, some of which broadly apply to healthcare items and services regardless of whether the payor is a government entity, commercial payor, or the individual patient. In addition, patient privacy and security laws have been imposed at the federal and state level. 

The federal Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Under the civil False Claims Act, no specific intent to defraud is required. The civil False Claims Act defines &#8220;knowing&#8221; to include not only actual knowledge but also instances in which the person acted in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Several pharmaceutical, device and 

&#160;

&#160;

other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses (i.e., &#8220;off-label promotion). 

The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal Health Care False Statements Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Unlike the civil False Claims Act, this law requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes, among other things, the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offers any &#8220;remuneration&#8221; to beneficiaries of government healthcare programs where the person making the payment knows or should know that it is likely to influence the beneficiaries&#8217; selection of items or services reimbursable by government healthcare programs. 

The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires applicable pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered drugs (prescription drugs for which government healthcare program payment is available either separately or as part of a bundled payment) to track payments and other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintain a payments database, and publicly report the payment data. Applicable pharmaceutical manufacturers are also required to track and report physician investment and ownership interests that are within the scope of the law. Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program were required to begin such tracking on August 1, 2013, and were required to make their first report containing aggregate data to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, by March 31, 2014 and the second report containing detailed payment and transfers of value data and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. CMS will post manufacturer disclosures on a searchable public website on or before September 30, 2014. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; 

Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, and state laws governing professional licensing and licensee conduct, may apply to sales, marketing, or referral arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such state laws vary in scope; some are limited to state funded healthcare such as Medicaid, while others broadly apply to providers of healthcare items and services regardless of whether the payor is a government entity, commercial payor, or the individual patient. Several state laws require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare providers in those states, prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers and/or require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. 

Under HIPAA and its implementing regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of patients&#8217; protected health information used or disclosed by &#8220;covered entities,&#8221; with certain requirements for &#8220;business associates&#8221; of covered entities. In the context of clinical trials, healthcare providers and facilities that serve as investigators and study sites are frequently HIPAA covered entities and must adhere to applicable requirements. Although we do not generally anticipate that we will be directly subject to HIPAA it is possible that some of our activities may trigger HIPAA compliance concerns. In addition, state privacy laws may be more broadly applicable to a variety of entities. 

The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. 

&#160;

&#160;

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certai n items and services to our customers in the future, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we ma y be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm , administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our p roducts, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporat e compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Payment for Aesthetic Products. &#160; &#160; In general, in the U.S. health system, much of the financial success of a product typically relies on the government or commercial payors paying for a patient&#8217;s use of a product. Typically coverage of a product will depend on whether it is deemed medically necessary by government and commercial payors. Given the cosmetic nature and intent of LIPO-202, we do not anticipate that any government or commercial payors will cover and reimburse for this product or procedures using this product. Accordingly, a patient would have to pay for the cost of LIPO-202 out-of-pocket, making our expected reimbursement for our products and procedures using our products different from that of many pharmaceutical companies offering non-aesthetic products in the United States. Nevertheless, given our planned operation in the aesthetic market and the reimbursement framework for other aesthetic products currently on the market, we do not expect that the inability to receive reimbursement from a government or other third party payor for the use of the product will significantly impact a patient&#8217;s decision to use or a physician&#8217;s decision to prescribe or recommend our products. 

Healthcare Reform. &#160; &#160; The recent implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an example that has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 

The Affordable Care Act is designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending, and improve healthcare quality. The law includes provisions to tie Medicare provider reimbursement to healthcare quality and incentives, require the implementation of healthcare compliance programs, enhance physician payment transparency disclosure requirements, increase funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse, and include incentives to state Medicaid programs to expand their coverage and services. It also imposes an annual tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell &#8220;branded prescription drugs&#8221; to certain federal healthcare programs. 

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures as well as cost containment initiatives by third-party payors will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governmental and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain products or additional pricing pressure. Although as noted above, we anticipate that our lead product candidate, if approved, will be paid for out-of-pocket by the patient, it is nevertheless possible that federal or state healthcare reform could impact our business, particularly if we resume development of LIPO-102. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have retained all commercial rights to LIPO-202 in all areas of the world except Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Our plan is to create a focused commercial capability in the United States to market and sell LIPO-202 and to consider strategic partners in other areas of the world to complete development and commercialization of the product candidate. Specifically, we plan to build a focused, specialized sales force targeting plastic surgeons and cosmetic dermatologists operating in the aesthetics market. 

Manufacturing 

We contract with third parties for the manufacture of LIPO-202 and LIPO-102 and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 

Competition 

The aesthetic market, and in particular the market for fat reduction and body contouring, is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving due to new technology introductions. The FDA has recently approved several modalities for the reduction of fat, most of which are energy-based medical devices. In April 2015, the FDA approved Kybella as the first and only injectable submental fat contouring drug. Kybella is an 

&#160;

&#160;

injectable deoxycholic acid owned by Allergan in the United States. The Kybella label includes wording that safety and efficacy outside the submental region has not bee n established and is not recommended. In addition, while we are unaware of any potentially competitive injectable drugs that may reach the market before LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat, we anticipate that LIP O-202, if approved, will face significant competition from surgical alternatives for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat and other medical device technologies designed for the reduction of fat. 

Surgical Fat Reduction. Liposuction remains the primary treatment option for subcutaneous fat reduction. We expect that LIPO-202 may compete indirectly with limited-volume liposuction for physician preference and resources. 

Non-Surgical Technologies for Fat Reduction. The FDA has approved several medical devices for fat reduction as well as one injectable drug, Kybella, specifically for submental fat contouring. For example, ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. received clearance for their body contouring system, CoolSculpting&#174;, which utilizes controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area for the selective reduction of fat around the abdomen and flanks. SculpSure&#174; is the first FDA-cleared laser treatment for on-invasive lipolysis of the flanks and abdomen, using controlled light-based technology. Zerona, a laser energy-based product marketed by Erchonia Corporation, and Liposonix, an ultrasound energy-based product marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., have also received FDA marketing clearance. TruSculpt, a radiofrequency energy-based product introduced by Cutera, Inc., is used to heat fat to kill fat cells. However, unlike the devices provided by Erchonia, Valeant or ZELTIQ, the Cutera device is not cleared by the FDA for fat reduction; rather, it has a clearance for topical heating and for temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite. In addition, we may in the future face competition from new and emerging technologies. 

Aesthetic Therapeutics Market Competition. Injectable botulinum toxins and dermal fillers dominate the injectable aesthetic therapeutics market, specifically for facial rejuvenation. . In April 2015, the FDA approved Kybella as the first and only injectable submental fat contouring drug. While we believe LIPO-202 will be a complementary procedure to these existing injectables, for some patients we may compete for a share of their discretionary budget and share of mind within the physician&#8217;s office for improving body aesthetics. 

We expect to also generally compete against medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and technologies unrelated to fat reduction, for physician resources and mind share. Many of our potential competitors are large, experienced companies that have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do. For a description of the risks we face related to competition, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; LIPO-202, if approved, will face significant competition, and the failure by us to compete effectively may prevent us from achieving significant market acceptance .&#8221;

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates, novel biological and chemical discoveries, and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect and enhance our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to any patentable aspects of our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets and continuing technological innovation, and we continue to evaluate potential in-licensing opportunities, in order to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

The patent positions of pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. After issuance, if challenged, the courts can redefine the scope of the patent. Consequently, we do not know with certainty whether issued patents in each country will cover our product candidates, or if issued, whether the patent will remain in force after challenge. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. We cannot predict with certainty whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in a particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from potential competitors. Any of our patents could potentially be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity. For more information, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

Since patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a minimum of eighteen months, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of our inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which for most of our patent applications are based on the first party to invent (patents filed after March 2013 are given priority based on first to file). The date of an invention is not publically disclosed. It may be 

&#160;

&#160;

necessary for us to participate in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as patent oppositions or inter partes reviews that seek to invalidate the patentability of third party patents before they issue. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 

As of December 31, 2015, we are the sole owner of a patent portfolio that includes five issued patents and eight pending patent applications in the United States, as well as granted and pending foreign counterparts of such U.S. patents and pending applications directed to LIPO-202 and/or LIPO-102. Our foreign counterparts include issued or granted patents and pending applications in Australia, Canada, various countries in Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, China, Brazil, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, and Taiwan. The earliest expiration of any of our issued or granted patents is presently expected to occur in 2026. Four of our five issued U.S. patents, specifically U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,404,750, 8,420,625, 9,132,084, and 9,198,885, cover both of our LIPO-202 and LIPO-102 product candidates, and will be listable in the Orange Book for each of these product candidates upon product approval. 

The &#8217;625 and the &#8217;885 patents are directed to methods of treatment for reduction of adiposity using a long-acting substantially selective &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist and are expected to expire no earlier than 2026. 

The &#8217;750 and the &#8217;084 patents are directed to methods of treatment for reducing adipose tissue and pharmaceutical formulations using low doses of long-acting selective &#223;2-adrenergic receptor agonist active ingredient, e.g. salmeterol xinafoate, and are expected to expire no earlier than 2030. We expect that the breadth of coverage provided by our issued patents relating to our product candidates will create a significant barrier to third party competition with our LIPO-202 and LIPO-102 products, and will help to render any challenge to our patent position by a third party in relation to our core product candidates difficult. We expect to continue pursuing in the United States and foreign jurisdictions additional patent protection of our product candidates and any future pipeline products or technologies where appropriate, as well as continuing to take appropriate measures to maintain non-patent proprietary protection for our innovative technologies. 

Trademarks. We have a pending U.S. trademark application for the word mark &#8220;NEOTHETICS&#8221; and for our logo. We intend to pursue additional registrations in markets outside the United States for appropriate marks where we plan to sell our product candidates. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains references to our trademarks and to trademarks belonging to other entities. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including logos, artwork and other visual displays, may appear without the &#174; or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. We do not intend our use or display of other companies&#8217; trade names or trademarks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other company. 

Other Proprietary Rights and Processes. We also rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and disclose our technology. If these events happen, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business, scientific, development or financial affairs that are either developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or based on the employee&#8217;s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property or that we have an exclusive royalty-free license to use such technology. 

Material Agreements 

Technology Transfer Agreement . In connection with our Series C convertible preferred stock financing, in December 2012, we entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Domain Russia Investments Limited, or DRI, an affiliate of Domain Partners VII, L.P. and DP VII, L.P., a significant stockholder of our company . Concurrently with the signing of the Technology Transfer Agreement, we, together with DRI and NovaMedica, LLC, or NovaMedica, executed an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which all of DRI&#8217;s rights and obligations under the Technology Transfer Agreement were transferred to NovaMedica. The following description of the Technology Transfer Agreement gives effect to the transfer of DRI&#8217;s rights and obligations under the Technology Transfer Agreement to NovaMedica. The Technology Transfer Agreement obligated us to assign and license certain of our intellectual property to NovaMedica and to enter into the Clinical Development and Collaboration Agreement, Clinical Supply Agreement and the Commercial Supply Agreement with NovaMedica as further described below. 

Pursuant to the Technology Transfer Agreement, in exchange for a nominal payment, we assigned to NovaMedica certain patents and patents applications in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, or the Covered Territory, owned by us and necessary or useful for the development and commercialization of LIPO-102, LIPO-202 and/or certain future products we may develop, or the LIPO Products. We also granted to NovaMedica an exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free and irrevocable license under certain of our patented and non-patented intellectual property to develop and commercialize LIPO 

&#160;

&#160;

Products, solely in the Covered Territory. The license is not sublicensable or assignable, other than to an affiliate of NovaMedica or a successor to substantially all of the business of NovaMedica to which the Technol ogy Transfer Agreement relates. We further agreed not to directly or indirectly develop, manufacture, sell or commercialize any product that (A) contains salmeterol xinafoate (alone or in combination) or (B) is designed or intended for use in the field of localized reduction of fat in the human body, including without limitation body contouring, or the Field, and is approved in the Covered Territory for the same indication for which a LIPO Product is approved during the term of the Technology Transfer Agree ment. 

To assist in NovaMedica&#8217;s development, commercialization, and manufacturing of LIPO Products, we agreed to transfer our know-how which is necessary or useful for development or commercialization of LIPO Products in the Covered Territory. Further, we agreed to provide certain development and manufacturing support to NovaMedica, including making our manufacturing personnel and other personnel knowledgeable of LIPO Products available to provide scientific and technical explanations, advice and on-site support that may be reasonably requested by NovaMedica and, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist NovaMedica to establish a manufacturing relationship with our clinical manufacturing organizations. In addition, prior to the first commercial sale of a LIPO Product in the Covered Territory, we have agreed to sell to NovaMedica supplies of the applicable LIPO Product and related compounds solely for the purpose of conducting clinical trials of such LIPO Product and related compounds in the Covered Territory at our cost plus a mark-up in the low double digits, so long as any sale does not reasonably interfere with our own development and commercialization activities. Furthermore, within 120 days of NovaMedica&#8217;s request, we are obligated to negotiate in good faith and enter into a Commercial Supply Agreement with NovaMedica for the supply of the LIPO Product required for commercialization of an approved LIPO Product in the Covered Territory, on commercially fair and reasonable terms at our cost plus a mark-up in the low double digits. 

Under the Technology Transfer Agreement, NovaMedica will be responsible for filing and maintaining regulatory approvals for the LIPO Products in the Covered Territory and has the right to use the data from our regulatory filings to support its regulatory filings for LIPO Products. NovaMedica also has the sole right to import LIPO Products into the Covered Territory for purposes of development and commercialization of LIPO Products and the right to import and export LIPO Products outside the Covered Territory in connection with noncommercial research, clinical trials, or obtaining a supply of LIPO Product to exercise its other rights under the Technology Transfer Agreement. 

We may terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement in the event NovaMedica (1) knowingly exports out of the Covered Territory for commercial purposes a material and substantial quantity of salmeterol xinafoate or a LIPO Product or (2) challenges or contests the validity or enforceability of any of our patents assigned or licensed to NovaMedica, and fails to cure such breach during the applicable cure period. NovaMedica has the right to terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement at any time at its convenience upon 90 days prior written notice. Upon termination by NovaMedica, the licenses granted to NovaMedica would also terminate, but the assigned patents and patent applications would not return to our control. 

In connection with the signing of the Technology Transfer Agreement, we also concurrently entered into a letter agreement with NovaMedica pursuant to which we are obligated to pay NovaMedica a make-whole payment up to a maximum amount of $1.2 million upon the occurrence any of the following events: 

&#160;

&#183; 

any granted patent within the assigned patents is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court or other governmental body in the Covered Territory; 

&#160;

&#183; 

it is determined that we do not (or did not at the time of assignment) hold exclusive title and ownership to any assigned patent or patent application or licensed intellectual property (free and clear of all liens or encumbrances); or 

&#160;

&#183; 

the licenses or other rights granted by us to NovaMedica pursuant to the Technology Transfer Agreement terminate prior to the expiration date of the Technology Transfer Agreement (other than as contemplated by the Technology Transfer Agreement), and as a result, NovaMedica is required under Russian law to make a compensatory contribution to NovaMedica. 

Clinical Development and Collaboration Agreement. As required by the Technology Transfer Agreement, we entered into a Clinical Development and Collaboration Agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with NovaMedica in July 2013 to further specify the terms on which NovaMedica develops LIPO Products. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, a joint committee consisting of equal numbers of our representatives and NovaMedica representatives will prepare an initial development plan to obtain regulatory approval for LIPO Products. Pursuant to the Technology Transfer Agreement, we have also agreed to enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement within 180 days of the first regulatory approval of a LIPO Product in the Covered Territory. NovaMedica may sell LIPO Products approved for sale in the Covered Territory under either NovaMedica&#8217;s trademarks or our trademarks, in its sole discretion. 

The Collaboration Agreement expires on the earlier of (1) the termination of the Technology Transfer Agreement or (2) ten years following the first commercial sale of a LIPO Product in the Covered Territory, provided that if the first commercial sale of a LIPO Product in the Covered Territory has not occurred within three years of the approval of the first LIPO Product by the FDA, then the Collaboration Agreement will terminate on the thirteenth anniversary of such FDA approval. NovaMedica may terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice. 

&#160;

&#160;

Clinical Supply Agreement. As required by the Technology Trans fer Agreement, we entered into a Clinical Supply Agreement with NovaMedica in July 2013 to further specify the terms on which we supply LIPO-202 to NovaMedica. In addition to the supply terms set forth above, under the Clinical Supply Agreement, we are not required to supply any LIPO-202 until we have retained a clinical manufacturing organization to manufacture such product. We are only required to supply LIPO-202 up to a specified maximum amount of 1,000 doses. The Clinical Supply Agreement has an initial term of four years, which can be extended by mutual agreement between us and NovaMedica. NovaMedica may terminate the agreement for convenience upon 90 days&#8217; notice.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs.
