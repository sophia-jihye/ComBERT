 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

Tiptree Financial is a diversified holding company that primarily acquires and manages controlling interests of operating businesses. The Company, whose operations date back to 2007, currently has subsidiaries that operate in the following four segments: insurance and insurance services, specialty finance, asset management and real estate. The Company&#8217;s principal investments are included in a corporate and other segment. Tiptree Financial&#8217;s Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market. All of Tiptree Financial&#8217;s Class B common stock is owned by TFP. Tiptree Financial&#8217;s Class B common stock has voting but no economic rights. 

From July 1, 2014, the limited partners of TFP (other than Tiptree Financial itself) have been provided with the opportunity to exchange TFP partnership units for Tiptree Financial Class A common stock at a rate of 2.798 shares of Class A common stock per partnership unit. The percentage of TFP (and therefore Operating Company) owned by Tiptree Financial may increase in the future to the extent TFP&#8217;s limited partners choose to exchange their limited partnership units of TFP for Class A common stock of Tiptree Financial. 

Effective January 1, 2016, Tiptree Financial, TFP and Operating Company created a consolidated group among themselves and various Operating Company subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with Tiptree Financial being the parent company. In connection with the creation of the consolidated group, TFP and Operating Company elected to be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Tiptree Financial contributed its 28% interest in Operating Company to TFP in exchange for 4,307,023 additional common units of TFP. As a result of these steps, effective January 1, 2016, Tiptree Financial directly owns 81.29% of TFP and TFP directly owns 100% of Operating Company.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2015 

On January 1, 2015, Fortegra exercised an option to acquire the remainder of ProtectCELL, which is now 100% owned by Fortegra. 

On February 9, 2015, affiliates of Care acquired five seniors housing communities with affiliates of Royal for $29.3 million &#32;which are managed by Royal pursuant to a management agreement. 

On March 30, 2015, Care completed the purchase of six seniors housing communities for $54.5 million . The properties are leased to Greenfield, who operate the properties. 

In May 2015, the Company leveraged its $25.0 million &#32;to seed Telos Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P., a leveraged loan fund managed by the Company&#8217;s Telos subsidiary with an asset based secured credit facility of which $54.9 million &#32;was outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

During the second quarter, the Company sold its investments in the subordinated notes issued by Telos 2 and Telos 4 to partly fund the diversification of its principal investments and to recycle capital from existing CLOs into a warehouse facility with the objective of creating new CLOs to increase asset management fees. The sales generated net cash of $39.7 million &#32;and realized losses of $8.0 million . 

On June 30, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its PFG subsidiary for proceeds to the Company of $142.8 million &#32;at closing and future payments over the next two years totaling approximately $7.3 million . The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $27.2 million &#32;and an after tax gain of $15.6 million &#32;in 2015, which is classified as a gain on sale from discontinued operations. The Company has reclassified the income and expenses attributable to PFG to income from discontinued operations, net for 2014 and 2015. 

On July 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Reliance, a retail mortgage originator, for $7.5 million in cash, 1,625,000 shares of Class A common stock, $2.78 million in working capital adjustments and an earn-out provision over 3 years of up to 2 million Tiptree Class A shares. 

During the second half of 2015, we contributed an aggregate of $45 million to a special purpose vehicle, Telos CLO 2016-7, Ltd.

During 2015, the Company made principal investments in pools of NPLs of approximately $39.7 million . In the first quarter of 2016, the Company purchased an additional $8.0 million &#32;in NPLs, bringing the Company&#8217;s total investment in NPLs to $47.7 million &#32;as of the date of this report. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries purchased approximately 1.4 million common shares of RAIT, a publicly traded multi-strategy commercial real estate investment trust, for an aggregate of $3.5 million.

HOLDING COMPANY 

Tiptree&#8217;s Strategy 

Tiptree Financial is a diversified holding company that draws upon the extensive experience of its management team in the areas of insurance, specialty finance, asset management, real estate and credit investing to acquire controlling interests of operating businesses. We believe our business ownership mix of (i) specialty insurance, insurance services and warranty protection companies, (ii) operating companies which principally originate or own tangible assets, and (iii) asset management companies which earn fees from third-party investment vehicles, provides business synergies which generate a higher overall return on shareholder capital. 

When making new acquisitions, we strive to identify businesses that: (i) have strong and experienced management, (ii) have the potential to generate attractive and stable cash returns on capital with limited downside, (iii) complement existing businesses or strategies through clearly identifiable synergies, and (iv) have sustainable and scalable business models. Tiptree&#8217;s permanent capital base allows us to have a long term view of our businesses, providing a competitive advantage relative to alternative capital sources with shorter-term objectives. We will retain a well-performing business for an indefinite period, but will consider selling a business when we believe material shareholder value creation will be achieved. 

When we acquire a business, we aim to partner with the management and employees, providing assistance when needed, but relying on their unique expertise to run the business day-to-day. We enhance the value of our businesses by utilizing our experience in capital markets, mergers and acquisitions, capital raising, credit markets, distressed investing, securitization, asset management, corporate governance and government regulatory issues. We also optimize the efficiencies of our business operations by strategically using the resources and talents of our more than 900 employees at our consolidated subsidiaries. 

We seek to adopt a prudent approach with regard to our capital structure, the diversification of financial risk and the avoidance of reputational risk. We evaluate our performance primarily by the comparison of our shareholder&#8217;s long-term total return on capital to alternative investment options and major market indices. 

Tiptree Regulation 

Because Tiptree Financial indirectly owns capital stock in several insurance company subsidiaries, it is subject to the state insurance holding company statutes of states in which it has insurance operations, which limit affiliate transactions and dividends or distributions from our insurance subsidiaries. See &#8220;&#8212;Operating Businesses&#8212;Insurance and Insurance Services&#8212;Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to our Structure&#8212;Because we are a holding company, our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends to stockholders will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries that may be subject to restrictions.&#8221; The holding company statutes, as well as other laws, also require, among other things, prior regulatory approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, certain transactions between affiliates and payments of extraordinary dividends or distributions. As a holding company, Tiptree Financial is not regulated as an insurance company. 

Each of Tiptree&#8217;s operating businesses is subject to regulation as described under &#8220;&#8212; Operating Businesses&#8221; below. 

The 1940 Act may limit the types and nature of businesses that we engage in and assets that we may acquire. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters&#8212;Maintenance of our 1940 Act exemption will impose limits on our operations.&#8221; 

Tiptree&#8217;s Competition 

Each of our businesses faces competition, as discussed under &#8220;&#8212;Operating Businesses&#8221; below. In addition to the competition our businesses face, we are subject to significant competition for acquisition opportunities. Our competitors for acquisition include commercial and investment banks, mortgage companies, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, asset managers, private equity funds, hedge funds, family offices, real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, business development companies and special purpose acquisition vehicles. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater access to capital and other resources and may possess other competitive advantages. We believe that Tiptree Financial&#8217;s position as a public company may provide a competitive advantage over privately held entities that compete to acquire certain target businesses, unlike private buyers of companies such as private equity firms, Tiptree is able to pay for certain acquisitions with its own equity securities in addition to cash. 

Tiptree Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , Tiptree had 929 employees. As of that date, 20 persons provided services to Tiptree (as employees or pursuant to a services agreement) at the holding company level. 

OPERATING BUSINESSES 

Insurance and Insurance Services 

Tiptree&#8217;s insurance operations consist of Fortegra, a specialized insurance and insurance services company offering consumer related protection products, including credit insurance, non-standard auto insurance, warranties, service contracts, auto warranty and roadside assistance. Fortegra also offers administration services through a vertically integrated platform and provides fronting services for self-insured clients. 

Fortegra&#8217;s products and related services offer protection from life events and uncertainties along with simplified steps to ease consumers&#8217; recovery. Credit insurance and debt protection products offer consumers the option to protect a loan balance in the event of death, disability, job loss or other events that could impair the consumers&#8217; ability to repay a debt and damage their credit. Fortegra&#8217;s non-standard auto insurance programs, administered by managing general agents (&#8220;MGAs&#8221;), focus on servicing consumers in the non-standard market. Warranty and other service contracts for mobile handsets, furniture and major appliances provide consumers protection from product failure and loss. Automotive products protect consumers from mechanical failure and provide roadside assistance when needed. 

Fortegra&#8217;s products are marketed under its Fortegra, Life of the South, ProtectCELL, 4Warranty, United Motor Club, Continental Car Club, Auto Knight and Consecta brands. Through these brands, Fortegra delivers credit insurance, debt protection, warranty contracts, motor club solutions, membership plans and other services to installment loan companies, retailers, independent wireless dealers, regional banks, community banks, warranty administrators, automobile dealers, vacation ownership developers and credit unions. Fortegra&#8217;s clients then offer these products and services to their customers in conjunction with consumer transactions. 

Fortegra typically structures agreements with its clients whereby they share in the economic results of the program either through retrospective commission arrangements or producer-owned reinsurance companies. Fortegra may selectively assume insurance underwriting risk to meet clients&#8217; needs or to enhance its profitability. 

Fortegra generates revenues from net earned premiums. These premiums consist of direct and assumed earned premiums generated from the direct sale of payment protection insurance policies and non-standard auto insurance policies and premiums written by another carrier for payment protection insurance policies assumed by Fortegra. In addition to ceding premiums to producer owned reinsurance companies, Fortegra elects to cede to reinsurers a significant portion of the credit and auto insurance that it underwrites for loss protection and capital management purposes. Net earned premiums are offset in-part by commission expenses and loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

In addition, Fortegra generates service and administrative fee revenue for administering payment protection products and fronting arrangements on behalf of its clients and earns service and administrative fees from sales of warranty products and motor club solutions. These revenues are offset in part by commission expenses and member benefit claims. Fortegra earns ceding 

commissions for credit insurance that it cedes to reinsurers through coinsurance arrangements. In addition, Fortegra generates net investment income from its investment portfolio. 

Competition 

Fortegra operates in several niche markets and we believe that no single competitor competes against it in all of its business lines. The markets in which Fortegra operates are competitive based on many factors, including price, industry knowledge, quality of client service, sales force effectiveness, technology platforms and processes, the security and integrity of information systems, financial strength ratings, breadth of products and services, brand recognition and reputation. Fortegra&#8217;s credit protection products and warranty service contracts compete with similar products of insurance companies, warranty companies and other insurance service providers. Many of Fortegra&#8217;s competitors are significantly larger, have greater access to capital and may possess other competitive advantages. The principal competitors for Fortegra include: The Warranty Group, Inc., Assurant, Inc., eSecuritel Holdings, LLC, Asurion, LLC, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. and several smaller regional companies. 

Regulation 

Fortegra&#8217;s business is subject to extensive regulation and supervision, including at the federal, state, local and foreign levels. Fortegra&#8217;s insurance company, service contract, and motor club subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which it transacts business. Fortegra&#8217;s insurance products and its business are also affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws, and the tax laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. 

Fortegra owns and operates insurance company subsidiaries to meet the various requirements of the jurisdictions where it operates. Fortegra&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are generally restricted by the insurance laws of their respective domiciles as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of the respective regulatory authorities. Generally, the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to a stated percentage of that subsidiary&#8217;s statutory surplus as of a certain date, or net income of the subsidiary for the preceding year. 

Fortegra&#8217;s insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled in California, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. The regulation, supervision and administration by state departments of insurance relate, among other things, to: 

&#8226; 

standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; 

&#8226; 

restrictions on the payment of dividends; 

&#8226; 

changes in control of insurance companies; 

&#8226; 

the licensing of insurers and their agents and other producers; 

&#8226; 

the types of insurance that may be written; 

&#8226; 

privacy practices; 

&#8226; 

the ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets; 

&#8226; 

the nature of and limitations on investments and premium rates, or restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy; 

&#8226; 

reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations; 

&#8226; 

deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; 

&#8226; 

payment of sales compensation to third parties; 

&#8226; 

approval of policy forms; and 

&#8226; 

the regulation of market conduct, including underwriting and claims practices. 

Fortegra&#8217;s insurance company subsidiaries must comply with their respective state of domicile&#8217;s laws regulating insurance company investments, which are generally modeled on the standards promulgated by the NAIC. Such investment laws are generally permissive with respect to federal, state and municipal obligations, and more restrictive with respect to corporate obligations, particularly non-investment grade obligations, foreign investment, equity securities and real estate investments. Each insurance company is therefore limited by the investment laws of its state of domicile from making excessive investments in any given security (such as single issuer limitations) or in certain classes or riskier investments (such as aggregate limitation in non-investment grade bonds). 

The NAIC has adopted a model act with risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) formulas to be applied to insurance companies to measure the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile. State insurance regulators use RBC standards to determine appropriate actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions. The domiciliary states of Fortegra&#8217;s insurance company subsidiaries have adopted laws substantially similar to the NAIC&#8217;s RBC model act. Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having total adjusted 

capital less than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital inadequacy. 

A portion of Fortegra&#8217;s business is ceded to its reinsurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Turks and Caicos. Those subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements, such as filing annual financial statements, filing annual certificates of compliance and paying annual fees. 

In connection with the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress created the CFPB. While the CFPB does not have direct jurisdiction over insurance products under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is possible that regulatory actions taken by the CFPB may affect the sales practices related to these products and thereby potentially affect Fortegra&#8217;s business or the clients that it serves. 

Fortegra is also subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to its administration of insurance products on behalf of other insurers. In order for Fortegra to process and administer insurance products of other companies, it is required to maintain licenses of a third party administrator in the states where those insurance companies operate. Fortegra is also subject to the related federal and state privacy laws and must comply with data protection and privacy laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA and certain state data privacy laws. Fortegra is also subject to laws and regulations related to call center services, such as the Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act and rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission and the CAN-SPAM Act. 

Seasonality &#32; 

Fortegra&#8217;s financial results may be affected by seasonal variations. Revenues associated with its products may fluctuate seasonally based on consumer spending trends. Consumer spending has historically been higher in September and December, corresponding to the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Accordingly, Fortegra&#8217;s revenues from its products may be higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year. Member benefit claims on mobile device protection are typically more frequent in the summer months, and accordingly, Fortegra&#8217;s claims expense from those products may be higher in the second and third quarters than other times of the year. 

Employees &#32; 

At December 31, 2015 , Fortegra employed 411 employees, on a full or part time basis. 

Intellectual Property &#32; 

Fortegra owns or licenses a number of trademarks, patents, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to its services and products. Although Fortegra believes that these intellectual property rights are, in the aggregate, of material importance to its business, Fortegra believes that its business is not materially dependent upon any particular trademark, trade name, copyright, service mark, license or other intellectual property right. Fortegra has entered into confidentiality agreements with its clients that impose restrictions on its clients&#8217; use of Fortegra&#8217;s proprietary software and other intellectual property rights. 

Specialty Finance 

Tiptree&#8217;s specialty finance operations consists of a controlling ownership interest in Siena, which provides asset-based loans to smaller U.S. businesses, our mortgage origination business, which is conducted through two entities, Reliance, which is wholly owned and Luxury, which is 67.5% owned by the Company. The Company intends to continue to grow its specialty finance operations organically through increased volume, through acquisitions and by exploring strategic alternatives with respect to new financing products. 

Mortgage Business 

The operations of Luxury and Reliance include the origination, packaging and sale of mortgage loans, primarily FHA/ VA, conforming/agency and jumbo mortgage loans. The loans are typically sold shortly after origination into a liquid secondary market. Loans sold into the secondary market may be sold &#8220;servicing-retained&#8221; or &#8220;servicing-released,&#8221; referring to whether the rights to service the mortgage are retained by the originator or released to the secondary market investor at the time of sale. Luxury and Reliance currently sell all of their loans on a servicing released basis. However, Reliance has the appropriate approvals to retain servicing and expects to begin doing so on a limited basis in 2016. Our mortgage business is financed using warehouse revolving credit facilities to fund mortgage loans held for sale. Revenues are generated from gain on sale of loans, net interest income and loan fee income. 

Our mortgage business offers a variety of residential fixed and adjustable rate mortgage products. We currently use two production channels to originate or acquire mortgage loans: retail sales offices (commonly referred to as &#8220;retail&#8221;), and a broker channel (commonly referred to as &#8220;wholesale&#8221;). Each production channel produces similar mortgage loan products and generally applies the same underwriting standards. We leverage technology to streamline the mortgage origination process and bring service and convenience to both channels. In the wholesale channel, brokers are able to register and lock loans, check the status of the loan, and deliver documents in electronic format through the Internet. Our sales support team assists brokers in jurisdictions where our mortgage business is licensed to do business. 

In the retail channel, loans are originated by mortgage loan originators employed by us. When loans are originated on a retail basis, the origination documentation is completed internally inclusive of customer disclosures and other aspects of the lending process and the funding of the transactions. In the wholesale channel, an unaffiliated bank, mortgage bank, or mortgage brokerage company completes much of the loan paperwork. All loans are underwritten on a loan-level basis to our underwriting standards. 

Competition 

The market for origination of residential mortgages is highly competitive. There are a large number of institutions offering mortgage loans, including many that operate on a national scale, as well as local savings banks, commercial banks, and other lenders. With respect to those products that we offer, we compete by offering competitive interest rates, fees, and other loan terms and services and by offering efficient and rapid service. Many of our mortgage business competitors are larger and have access to greater financial resources. In addition, many of the largest competitors are banks or are affiliated with banking institutions, the advantages of which include, but are not limited to, the ability to hold mortgage loan originations in an investment portfolio and having access to financing with more favorable terms, including lower interest rate bank deposits as a favorable source of funding. 

Regulation 

Our mortgage business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations. Luxury is licensed or qualified to do business in 22 states and Reliance is licensed or qualified to do business in 32 states in the U.S. Luxury and Reliance must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Patriot Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and state foreclosure laws. These statutes apply to loan origination, fair lending, debt collection, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. 

Employees 

Our mortgage business had 467 employees as of December 31, 2015 . 

Siena Lending Group 

Siena is a commercial finance company providing financing solutions to small and medium sized U.S. companies. Siena originates, structures, underwrites and services senior secured asset-based loans for companies with sales typically between $5 million and $50 million operating across a range of industry sectors. Its core financing solutions include revolving lines of credit and term loans and typically range in size from $1 million to $25 million. Siena also has the ability to arrange significantly larger transactions that may be syndicated to others or Siena may participate in large syndications itself. Siena funds its lending practice from capital contributions by its owners as well as from a revolving credit agreement. 

Siena&#8217;s loans are typically used to fund working capital needs and are secured by eligible, margined collateral, including accounts receivable, inventories, and, to a lesser extent, other long-term assets. In determining a borrowers&#8217; ability and willingness to repay loans, Siena conducts a detailed due diligence investigation to assess financial reporting accuracy and capabilities as well as to verify the values of business assets, among other things. Siena employs third parties to conduct field exams to audit financial reporting and to appraise the value of certain types of collateral in order to estimate its liquidation value. Financing arrangements with customers also typically include substantial controls over the application of borrowers&#8217; cash and Siena retains discretion over collateral advance rates and eligibility among other key terms and conditions. 

Siena also offers a servicing platform, which provides asset-based lending solutions for community and regional banks that do not have the expertise or capacity to underwrite or service asset-based loans. 

Competition 

Siena&#8217;s market is competitive, based on factors that vary by product, customer, and geographic region. Competitors include commercial and investment banks, regional and community banks, captive finance companies, and other niche specialty finance companies. Many of the larger competitors have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources than Siena. 

Employees 

Siena had 18 employees as of December 31, 2015 . 

Real Estate 

Tiptree&#8217;s real estate operations consist of Care, a real estate investment company focused on seniors housing. As of December 31, 2015, Care&#8217;s portfolio consisted of 24 properties across 9 states in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southern United States. Care&#8217;s properties are either leased to tenants pursuant to a triple net lease (&#8220;Triple Net Lease Properties&#8221;) or owned by Care but managed by a management company pursuant to a management agreement (&#8220;Managed Properties&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, Care&#8217;s portfolio is comprised of 11 Triple Net Lease Properties and 13 Managed Properties. 

In Triple Net Lease Properties, Care only owns the real estate and enters into a long term lease with an operator who is typically responsible for bearing operating costs, including maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance, repairs and capital improvements. Triple Net Lease Properties are not consolidated since Care does not manage the underlying operations. For Triple Net Lease Properties operations, Care recognizes primarily rental income from the lease since substantially all expenses are passed through to the tenant. In Managed Properties, Care generally owns between 65-80% of the real estate and the operations with affiliates of the management company owning the remainder. Care therefore consolidates all of the assets, liabilities, income and expense of the Managed Properties operations in segment reporting. 

15 out of Care&#8217;s 24 facilities, representing over 50% of its real estate portfolio by purchase price, were acquired between the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. In connection with the acquisition of 13 of the 15 recent acquisition properties, Care brought new management to the properties and initiated comprehensive capital expenditure plans designed to grow revenues and drive efficiencies. 

Care&#8217;s focus is on acquisitions ranging in size from $5 to $250 million in the seniors housing industry. Care&#8217;s overall strategy is to identify strong and experienced managers or operators of seniors housing facilities who are looking to expand and diversify their operations by entering into strategic relationships with a capital partner. Care may also own a portion of the operations of seniors housing properties and partner with experienced managers to run the day-to-day operations at the properties while affiliates of the managers own the remaining percentage of the properties and operations. Care is funded by a combination of internally generated capital, cash contributed from Tiptree and property-specific recourse debt used to acquire properties that generate income and gain on sale of assets. 

Care&#8217;s seniors housing communities currently include senior apartments, independent and assisted living communities, a skilled nursing facility and memory care communities. Rent payments and services provided in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Care intends to continue to grow its portfolio primarily through the acquisition of seniors housing properties, utilizing investment structures such as Triple Net Lease Properties and Managed Properties. As Care acquires additional properties and expands its portfolio, it intends to further diversify its concentrations by tenant, asset class and geography within the seniors housing sector, including further investments in senior apartments, independent and assisted living communities, and memory care communities. 

Competition 

Care competes for investments in the seniors housing and care sector with other real estate investment companies and real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity firms and hedge funds, finance/investment companies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, health care and seniors housing operators and developers. Care competes for investments based on a number of factors including investment structures, underwriting criteria and reputation. Care&#8217;s ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital and new and existing laws and regulations. 

The operators/managers/lessees of Care&#8217;s properties compete on a local and regional basis with those of properties that provide comparable services. Operators/managers/lessees compete for residents based on a number of factors including quality of service, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences, staff and price. 

Regulation 

Tenants and operators of healthcare properties are typically subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and the Hazard Communication Act govern such matters as wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. Some of these laws and regulations impose joint and several liabilities on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. In addition, there are various federal, state and local fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations applicable to healthcare properties. 

Care&#8217;s properties may be affected by Care&#8217;s operators&#8217;, managers&#8217; and lessees&#8217; operations, the existing condition of land when acquired, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties. The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may make it difficult or impossible to sell or rent a property. 

In addition, the healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal, state and local licensing requirements, facility inspections, reimbursement policies, regulations concerning capital and other expenditures, certification requirements and other laws, regulations and rules. In addition, regulators require compliance by our tenants and third party operators with a variety of safety, health, staffing and other requirements relating to the design and conditions of the licensed facility and quality of care provided. The failure of any tenant, manager or operator to comply with such laws, requirements and regulations could affect a tenant&#8217;s, manager&#8217;s or operator&#8217;s ability to operate the facilities that Care owns. 

Private, federal and state payment programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , 3 employees were dedicated to Care (excluding the employees of Care&#8217;s Managed Properties). 

Asset Management 

TAMCO 

Tiptree&#8217;s asset management operations are conducted through TAMCO, an SEC-registered investment adviser that is primarily a holding company for Tiptree&#8217;s asset management subsidiaries, which include Telos and MCM. Telos primarily manages credit related assets. MCM currently manages portfolios of tax exempt securities for third parties and the Company. Tiptree seeks to grow its asset management operations through acquisitions and through investments in new products launched and managed by its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, TAMCO had approximately $1.9 billion &#32;of AUM for third parties. 

Competition 

TAMCO and its subsidiaries compete for business with other asset managers, including those affiliated with major commercial or investment banks and other financial institutions. Many of these organizations offer products and services that are similar to, or compete with, those TAMCO and its subsidiaries may offer, and many of these organizations have substantially more personnel and greater financial resources. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution channels that may make it more difficult for TAMCO and its subsidiaries to compete with them. Some competitors also have greater portfolio management resources, greater name recognition, have had managed client accounts for longer periods of time, have greater experience over a wider range of products or have other competitive advantages. The factors considered by clients in choosing TAMCO and its subsidiaries or a competitor include the past performance of the products managed, the background and experience of key personnel, the experience in managing a particular product, overall reputation, investment advisory fees and the structural features of the investment products offered. 

Regulation 

The asset management industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state securities laws as well as the rules of self-regulatory organizations. TAMCO is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and Telos and MCM (collectively with TAMCO, the &#8220;Advisers&#8221;) rely on TAMCO&#8217;s registration. The Advisers are also required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of the asset management business, including related sales and distribution activities, are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization rules. These laws, rules and regulations are primarily intended to protect the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. In addition, investment vehicles managed by the Advisers are subject to various securities laws and other laws. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , 10 employees were dedicated to TAMCO. 

Telos Asset Management 

Telos is an investment manager that establishes and manages investment products for pension funds, hedge funds and other asset management firms, banks, insurance companies and other types of institutional investors. Its core investment products are primarily in the form of CLOs and managed accounts investing in leveraged loans. 

The term &#8220;CLO&#8221; generally refers to a special purpose vehicle that owns a portfolio of senior secured loans and issues various tranches of debt and subordinated note securities to finance the purchase of those investments. The investment activities of a CLO are governed by extensive investment guidelines, generally contained within a CLO&#8217;s indenture and other governing documents, which limit, among other things, the CLO&#8217;s maximum exposure to any single industry or obligor and limit the ratings of the CLO&#8217;s assets. Most CLOs have a defined investment period during which they are allowed to make investments and reinvest capital as it becomes available. Telos, as investment advisor manager of CLOs, selects and actively manages the underlying assets to achieve target investment performance, while seeking to avoid losses. Historically, formation of a CLO to be managed by Telos has been funded by a combination of cash from Tiptree and warehouse revolving credit facilities which generate net interest income. At issuance of the new CLO, funding is provided by a combination of cash from Tiptree and from third party investors, creating a CLO that generates management fees to TAMCO and investment income to the Company. 

The investment advisory fees paid to Telos by the CLOs under management are its primary source of revenue and are generally paid on a quarterly basis. Investment advisory fees typically consist of senior and subordinated management fees based on the amount of assets and, in certain cases, include incentive fees based on the returns generated for certain investors. 

Telos is currently the manager of the following CLOs:

(1) Fee earning AUM as of the next distribution date after December 31, 2015, except for Telos 1, which is as of December 30, 2015. 

(2) 

CLOs are generally callable by equity holders (or the subordinated note holders of the CLO) once per quarter beginning after termination of a non-call period and subject to certain other restrictions. 

(3) 

&#8220;Termination of reinvestment period&#8221; refers to the date after which we can no longer use certain principal collections to purchase additional collateral and such collections are instead used to repay the outstanding amounts of certain debt securities issued by the CLO. 

(4) Represents the contractual maturity of the CLO. Generally, the actual maturity of the CLO is expected to occur in advance of contractual maturity. 

Telos also manages Telos 7, which, as of December 31, 2015, owned a $167.8 million &#32;pool of loans assembled in anticipation of launching a CLO, and Telos Credit Opportunities Fund, a $78.7 million &#32;leveraged loan fund seeded by Tiptree. 

Management fees are reported in the asset management segment. Tiptree owns various amounts of subordinated notes issued by Telos 1, Telos 5 and Telos 6 and management fee participation rights with an aggregate original purchase price of $47.2 million and a fair market value of $28.7 million as of December 31, 2015. CLO subordinated notes are often referred to as &#8220;equity&#8221; because they are entitled to recurring distributions which are generally equal to the remaining cash flow of the payments made by the securities owned by the CLO less contractual payments to debt holders and fund expenses. Distributions earned, realized gains/(losses), and changes in the fair value of subordinated notes owned by Tiptree are reported in our corporate and other segment.

Principal Investments 

The Company&#8217;s principal investments consist primarily of the positions in the subordinated notes of CLOs managed by Telos, common shares of RAIT, a portfolio of tax-exempt securities held by MFCA, investments in loans consisting of Telos 7, investments in NPLs, Telos credit opportunities and Tiptree&#8217;s interests in the Star Asia Entities, which are Tokyo-based real estate holding companies formed to invest predominately in Asian properties and real estate related debt instruments. The Company has been winding down its tax exempt securities portfolio. &#32; 

Through its subsidiary, Winsted Funding Trust 2015-1, Tiptree invests in pools of primarily nonperforming and reperforming residential mortgage loans purchased from private investors (rather than government agencies or directly from banks) at substantial discounts to unpaid principal balance (&#8220;UPB&#8221;) &#32; and at a discount to the appraised value of the properties securing the loans. Nonperforming loans are loans greater than 60 days delinquent or loans performing on a workout plan with a minimum of two contractual payments received in a three month period. Reperforming loans are loans less than 60 days delinquent. Tiptree seeks to either re-structure or modify the mortgages such that they become performing and then sell the loans at a profit. In cases where such modifications are not achieved Tiptree intends to foreclose on the underlying properties (which results in owned real estate (&#8220;REO&#8221;) and sell the properties at a profit. Tiptree has engaged Spurs Capital, LLC (&#8220;Spurs Capital&#8221;) to identify, evaluate and coordinate pools of NPLs for acquisition by Tiptree pursuant to an Acquisition Services Agreement and to manage Tiptree&#8217;s NPL portfolio including loan modifications and conversion to REO pursuant to an Asset Management Agreement. Tiptree has engaged Seneca Mortgage Servicing LLC (&#8220;Seneca&#8221;) to provide servicing of the loans and REO.
