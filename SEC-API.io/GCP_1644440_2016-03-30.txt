 Item 1. BUSINESS 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We are engaged in the production and sale of specialty construction chemicals, specialty building materials and packaging sealants and coatings through three global operating segments in which we have achieved leadership positions. Specialty Construction Chemicals manufactures and markets products to improve the performance of Portland cement, the most widely used construction material in the world, and materials based on Portland cement such as concrete admixtures and cement additives, as well as, concrete production management systems. Specialty Building Materials manufactures and markets building envelope products, residential building products and specialty construction products. Darex Packaging Technologies manufactures and markets sealants and coatings for use in beverage and food containers and other consumer and industrial applications. 

GCP Applied Technologies Inc. was incorporated on May 1, 2015 for the purpose of holding the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of W. R. Grace &#38; Co. On February 3, 2016, Grace shareholders of record received one common share of GCP for every one common share of Grace held as of the record date, January 27, 2016, and the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of Grace were transferred to GCP, thereby completing our legal separation from Grace ("the Separation"). On February 4, 2016, we began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GCP." 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , while we were still a part of Grace, we had net sales of $1.4 billion &#32;and $1.5 billion , income before income taxes of $125.2 million &#32;and $191.1 million &#32;and net income of $40.1 million &#32;and $134.3 million , respectively. Approximately 64% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;sales are generated outside the United States and we operate in over 40 &#32;countries. 

Strategy Overview 

Our objective is to deliver value to shareholders by growing our earnings, cash flow and returns on invested capital through the implementation of our business strategies. The Specialty Construction Chemicals, Specialty Building Materials and Darex Packaging Technologies segments are comprised of a portfolio of high - performance products. These products must satisfy well-defined performance requirements and specifications providing high-value to our customers, although they typically represent a low percentage of the total cost of customers&#8217; end-products. 

We implement our growth strategies using a number of key levers to accelerate our progress: 

Leverage Strong Segment Leadership Positions for Sales Growth &#8212; We utilize our global manufacturing and technical service footprint , &#32;our research and development and sales organizations , &#32;to increase geographic and customer penetration across our global footprint. We intend to make targeted investments to expand our capabilities in geographies and segments where trends and economic cycles present the best opportunities. 

Strengthen and Enhance Our Segment Positions with Product Innovation &#8212; We will seek to further advance our position as an industry innovator by investing in research development focused on commercializing differentiated products and services. To drive this innovation, we intend to employ our business model of introducing and supporting new technologies through our centralized research and development center in Cambridge, Massachusetts as well as our regional global applications labs. We may invest in additional regional application labs and field technical support resources as we expand our customer base and geographic penetration. 

Maintain Strong Customer Focus &#8212; A key aspect of our strategy is to continue to deliver product and technology solutions to our customers that help improve their product performance and productivity in their manufacturing operations. We believe that maintaining a close partnership with our customers allows us to effectively focus our innovation efforts and respond to their changing demands at a global, regional and local level.

SCC consists of two product groups: concrete admixtures and cement additives. 

Concrete admixtures 

The concrete admixtures product group includes concrete admixtures, admixtures for decorative concrete and concrete production management systems. 

Concrete admixtures allow concrete producers to use a limited selection of locally-sourced raw materials (cement and aggregates) to produce concrete to meet a wide variety of performance specifications. Our products are based on a set of core platform technologies formulated regionally into admixtures tailored to local end-use requirements. For example, our MIRA &#174; &#32;admixtures allow concrete to be produced with a lower amount of water, which improves the compressive strength and the long-term durability of the concrete. ADVA &#174; &#32;admixtures are used to make flowable "self-compacting concrete" which is popular in precast concrete manufacturing where the rapid filling of large molds is a major driver of economics. ECLIPSE &#174; &#32;admixtures are used to minimize the formation of shrinkage cracks in critical applications, such as bridge decks. STRUX &#174; &#32;polymeric fibers are designed to improve the ductility of concrete which is a naturally brittle material. In some cases, STRUX &#174; &#32;polymeric fibers may be used to replace steel reinforcement near the surface of concrete that will be exposed to corrosive de-icing salts. 

Admixtures for decorative concrete are used to create decorative/architectural concrete. PIERI &#174; &#32;surface retarders are used to obtain exposed aggregate finishes in precast and cast-in-place concrete, achieving the desired surface appearance. PIERI &#174; &#32;release agents allow for the efficient removal of mold forms with a resultant blemish-free concrete surface. 

Concrete production management systems provide sophisticated process monitoring and control while concrete is in transit to the jobsite. Our patented concrete production management system, VERIFI &#174; , measures, monitors and manages critical concrete properties and systematically adds water or admixtures to maintain optimum concrete flow properties. The result is increased product quality and consistency of concrete, fewer rejected loads, increased jobsite efficiency and minimized costly project delays. 

Cement additives 

Portland cement is the binding agent for concrete. National standards usually dictate the compressive strength and other properties that must be met by cement. Cement additives are used to reduce the energy required to mill cement to the desired fineness and to improve the handling characteristics of the powdered material. These products are also used to adjust the performance of Portland cement, permitting our customers to optimize production economics. Examples include HEA2 &#174; , which is used around the world to improve the energy efficiency of cement grinding operations and CBA &#174; , which is used to produce higher cement strength, providing a high level of process flexibility to the cement manufacturer. Increasingly, cement manufacturers seek to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing processes; our additives provide greater flexibility in raw materials, enabling customers to achieve improvements such as reductions in energy use and CO 2 &#32;emissions.

SBM consists of three product groups: building envelope, residential building products and specialty construction products. 

Building envelope products 

Building envelope products protect structures from water and help manage air and vapor transmission through building walls. The majority of sales in this product group are waterproofing products that protect commercial structures, residential structures and infrastructure. Our waterproofing products are used in both above-grade and below-grade applications. Above grade, our products protect the material to which they are applied and allow architects to design occupied spaces free from water infiltration, and below grade, our products enable the construction of structures in challenging sites, including portions below the existing water table. Examples of these products include our self-adhesive rubberized asphalt membrane, BITUTHENE &#174; &#32;and our innovative pre-applied sheet membrane, PREPRUFE &#174; . 

Our BITUTHENE &#174; &#32;product line is manufactured globally and has a long track record of providing waterproofing in the most challenging conditions. Designers and contractors have relied on BITUTHENE &#174; &#32;for over 40 years and continue to specify it by name. We pioneered the pre-applied waterproofing category with our Advanced Bond Technology&#8482; found in PREPRUFE &#174; . Our unique technology allows a waterproofing membrane to be installed on the ground or on walls before concrete is placed for a foundation. This technology also allows waterproofing of walls normally inaccessible during the construction of a building , &#32;such as foundations in densely populated cities. Major projects around the world have successfully implemented our PREPRUFE &#174; &#32;system and it continues to gain recognition for its waterproofing performance. 

Residential building products 

Residential building products consist of roofing underlayments, flashing and weather barriers. Roofing underlayments are placed below the outermost roof covering, such as shingles, to protect sloped roofs from water damage caused by wind-driven rain and ice dams. ICE &#38; WATER SHIELD &#174; roofing underlayments are known throughout the industry and are sold in North America through a network of distributors. The VYCOR &#174; &#32;flashing portfolio consists of high performance self-adhered flashing products that provide premium protection against water infiltration in critical areas such as windows and doors. VYCOR &#174; &#32;flashing reduces the risk of mold and rot development and contributes to energy efficiency by sealing air leakages from the building. 

Specialty construction products 

Specialty construction products include fire protection, chemical grouts and cementitious grouts and mortars. Passive fire protection products are marketed under the MONOKOTE &#174; &#32;brand. Chemical grouts are sold under the DE NEEF &#174; &#32;brand and are used to repair cracks in concrete, seal water leaks in commercial buildings and infrastructure in addition to soil stabilization. BETEC &#174; &#32;cementitious grouts and mortars are used in applications 

where specific strength and/or flow are required. Examples of these applications include assembly of concrete precast elements for wind turbines, filling under rails for railroads and providing a high-strength surface for heavy machinery in industrial settings.

Darex consists of two product groups: sealants and closures and coatings. 

Sealants and closures 

Our sealants and closures product group includes two product lines: can sealants and closures. 

Can sealants provide a hermetic seal between the lid and the body of the metal can used in beverage, food, aerosol and industrial packaging. We offer our customers a complete portfolio of both water-base and solvent-base technologies to address current industry trends of thinner gauge metals and high-speed production processes. 

Closures provide the seal for pry-off crowns, twist-off crowns and roll-on pilfer-proof (ROPP) and plastic caps. Our CELOX &#174; &#32;oxygen scavenging technology protects sensitive beverages from oxygen ingress into the packaging to extend product shelf life and prevent flavor deterioration, color changes and nutrient depletion. Our SINCERA &#174; &#32;lubricants are specifically designed for taste sensitive applications. 

Coatings 

Coatings protect both the interior and exterior surfaces of metal packaging containers and closures. Our coatings are engineered to prevent metal corrosion, ensure proper adhesion of sealing compounds and enhance graphic decorations on the exterior of containers and closures. We introduced our APPERTA &#174; &#32;coatings to address increasing industry demands for non-BPA technology. We specifically formulated our SISTIAGA &#174; &#32;coatings for technically demanding monobloc beverage and aerosol containers.

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our three operating segments maintain direct sales and technical teams made up of approximately 700 employees supporting customers in over 100 countries worldwide. Our global team sells products under annual and multi-year global, regional and local agreements and has developed deep segment and product application knowledge key to our customers' success. We believe our deep rooted understanding of our customers' needs, challenges and operations and our ability to service at high standards throughout the world, give all three segments a competitive advantage. The majority of our products require local, regional, country and international code approvals related to use, storage and performance. Our commercial organization supports and consults on committees and technical associations in order to ensure codes and product standards are consistently applied. 

Our SCC and SBM sales professionals work with leading architects, engineers and contractors across the globe seeking to ensure that our products are specified for use in thousands of projects annually. Our products are designed for use in some of the world's most demanding environments including the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the London Underground, Hong Kong&#8217;s Bank of China Tower, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and many other landmarks. As part of our "go to market" strategy, the SCC team provides technical services to over 10,000 concrete and cement production facilities worldwide. In many cases, we also provide product dispensing equipment to our customers as an integral part of the concrete and cement production process. 

Our Darex business employs a dedicated sales and technical service team to market our line of sealants and coatings in over 75 countries. Darex provides a high level of technical service at the customer facility to ensure proper use of our products, as well as ongoing consultation with our customers to drive productivity and value for the customer throughout the value chain. 

MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY CHAIN 

Our three operating segments share global supply chain processes, manufacturing facilities, as well as technical service and sales centers around the world, which provides cost efficiency. 

Specialty Construction Chemicals and Specialty Building Materials 

We utilize internal and third party manufacturing to produce our products to our specifications. Our low capital intensive plants along with third-party manufacturers provide us with flexibility in servicing our customers. Several of our plants ship internationally but most of our facilities are positioned to serve local market demand. We have the ability to respond quickly to changes in local demand by establishing or expanding manufacturing capacity with low capital investment. With both vendors and customers, we have numerous multi-year supply and purchasing agreements which help to minimize volume disruption. Construction demand is seasonal resulting in demand variations requiring effective management of our manufacturing and distribution assets. For many of our 

SCC customers, we install and maintain a chemical dispensing and storage system for our products at their production facilities. We periodically replenish the on-site systems to give our customers instant access to our SCC products in the amounts they require twenty-four hours a day. These dispensing and storage systems have accounted for approximately 32% of our annual capital spend. 

The raw materials we use in our products are obtained from a variety of suppliers, including basic chemical and petrochemical producers. Many of our raw materials are organic chemicals derived from olefins, including specialty films and fibers. We also make significant purchases of inorganic materials such as gypsum and specialty materials, including papers, rubber and asphalt. We have multiple raw material sources and balance our purchasing requirements between local and global sources seeking to maximize performance and profitability. Global supply and demand factors, changes in currency exchange rates and petroleum prices can significantly impact the price and availability of our key raw materials. 

Our global supply chain team is constantly monitoring the global market to identify cost and productivity opportunities. We seek to leverage our overall volumes for all regions. Since we manufacture a portion of our products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar and the euro may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for some raw materials. 

The construction business is cyclical, in response to economic conditions, as well as seasonal, driven by weather conditions. Demand for our products is primarily driven by global non-residential construction activity and U.S. residential construction activity. We seek to increase profitability and minimize the impact of cyclical downturns in regional economies by introducing technically advanced high-performance products and expanding geographically. 

Darex Packaging Technologies 

Our packaging products are manufactured by a network of globally integrated plants that are positioned to service our customers regionally. Our packaging products are manufactured in both large facilities to permit economies of scale and a network of smaller operations that enable customization to local conditions. 

The principal raw materials for Darex products include resins, solvents, latexes (including certain food-grade raw materials), polyolefins, pigments and rubber. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates. 

Prices for many of our raw materials, including specialty and commodity materials such as latex, rubbers, pigments, resins and solvents, have been volatile in recent years. In response to increases in raw material costs, we generally take actions to mitigate the effect of higher costs including increasing our product prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, increasing productivity and fixing purchase costs for certain raw materials. 

Since we manufacture a substantial portion of our packaging products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar and the euro may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for many of our raw materials. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 

Disclosure of financial information about industry segments and geographic areas for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) under Note 14 (Operating Segment Information) to the Combined Financial Statements, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Disclosure of risks attendant to our foreign operations is provided in this Report in Item 1A (Risk Factors). 

BACKLOG OF ORDERS 

While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales, nor are the changes, from time to time, significant. 

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We believe success in our industries is driven by technology and innovation. Growing our businesses and maintaining our margins depends on our ability to introduce new products based on innovative technology, as well as our ability to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection. Our research and development programs emphasize development of new products and processes, improvement of existing products and processes and application of existing products and processes to new industries and uses. The programs with the highest risk-adjusted impacts garner the necessary resources for success. 

Our world-class Global Technology Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts houses the product research activities of all three of our operating segments. The global marketing resources that we believe are essential to a successful product development process are also located with our research and development group in Cambridge. Overall, we have approximately 65 research and development employees based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Technologies developed by our Global Technology Center are customized for the regions and supported in the field by a network of Regional Technical Centers. This includes facilities in Sorocaba, Brazil; Singapore; Beijing, China; Atsugi, Japan; Epernon, France; L&#252;gde, Germany; Norderstedt, Germany; and Heist, Belgium. Across all three segments, there are over 300 research and development and technical service employees in our Regional Technical Centers. Globally we have close to 11% of our workforce focused on technology. We believe the collective technical expertise, industry knowledge and professionalism of this team is a significant differentiator for us. 

We file and patent applications internationally on a routine basis and obtain grants in numerous countries around the world in support of our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, equipment and improvements. We also benefit from technological and commercial advantages protected under trade secret laws, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products, technologies and internal quality control and testing methodologies. Entering 2016, we have over 800 active patents and patent applications in a number of countries around the world, including approximately 150 in the U.S. During the past five years, we have averaged approximately 5-10 U.S. patent issuances per year, with similar results in other countries in which we have filed counterpart patent applications. The average number of patents filed and granted could go up or down from year to year, depending on various factors, some of which may not be within our control. It is our intent to continue to file for patents to protect our proprietary innovations and investments in research. 

Research and development expenses were approximately $ 22.3 million &#32;in 2015 , $ 27.9 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $ 24.3 million &#32;in 2013 . These amounts include depreciation and amortization expenses related to research and development and expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount of research and development expenses relating to government -and customer- sponsored projects (rather than projects that we sponsor) was not material during these periods. 

ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS 

We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in remediation actions to address hazardous wastes or other materials as required by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws. 

We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. The following table sets forth our expenditures in the past three years and our estimated expenditures in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , for (i) environmental, health and safety (EH&#38;S) operating costs and waste disposal; (ii) capital expenditures for EH&#38;S related investments; and (iii) site remediation:
