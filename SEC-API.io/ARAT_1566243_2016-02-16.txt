 Item 1. Description of Business &#160; 

Arax Holdings Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 23, 2012 with a business plan to sell hot dogs from mobile hot dog stands throughout the major cities in Mexico. As of the filing of the 10K for last year, the Company stated that it was re-evaluating its business plan. 

&#160; 

It was further indicated as possible that a new business model could be related to a new business sector other than the food sector, and that any new business model could entail a capital restructuring of the Company in order to provide new capital and a broader base of shareholders. Such a capital restructuring of the Company could involve a merger or acquisition of assets through various techniques, including a possible reverse-merger. At October 31, 2015, and as of the date of this filing, Management believes that the best business model for our investors is to pursue business activity in the Life Sciences sector of the United States and possibly internationally. We will continue to assess these opportunities and structures as well as the various pre-requisite actions needed to finalize and implement any new business model. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a revision to a certain Consulting Agreement dated as of October 8, 2013, by and between Thru Pharma and Strategic Universal Advisors, LLC (&#8220;Strategic&#8221;), as amended effective January 17, 2014, on or about February 9, 2015, and most recently on October 20, 2015, with full effect as of April 1, 2015 (the &#8220;Consulting Agreement&#8221;), Thru Pharma and Strategic agreed that the intent of the Consulting Agreement ab initio was to provide Strategic with a 3% equity ownership of Thru Pharma n the event that a PUBCO M&#38;A transaction did not occur prior to the end of the Consulting Agreement. Thru Pharma and Strategic agreed and stipulated that 753,504 shares of Arax Holdings would equal 3% of Thru Pharma as the equity payment under the Consulting Agreement, with transfer subject to the further provisions stated below. As Thru Pharma was the sole beneficiary of the services provided by Strategic under the Consulting Agreement, no part of the value of the consideration for services provided under the Consulting Agreement has been recognized as an expense by the Company. 

&#160; 

In connection with earlier amendments to the Consulting Agreement, Strategic granted to Mr. Keough, a control person of the Company and Thru Pharma, an irrevocable proxy (the &#8220;Irrevocable Proxy&#8221;), to vote all of the common stock in the Company under certain conditions. That proxy no longer exists under the terms of the most recent amendment. 

&#160; 

As part of the currently amended Consulting Agreement, Thru Pharma agreed to transfer 753,504 Company shares to Strategic upon the closing of a merger or acquisition (an &#8220;M&#38;A Transaction&#8221;) of a public entity, resulting in Thru Pharma being the controlling owner of the entity that was the subject of the M&#38;A Transaction, and Thru Pharma would cause such entity to also issue to Strategic a stock warrant to purchase 600,000 (six hundred thousand) shares of common stock of the entity that was the subject of the M&#38;A Transaction. Such warrant will be of five-year duration, exercisable at $0.10 per share, and shall vest in four equal amounts of 150,000 shares with the first annual vesting to occur 60 (sixty) days following the completion of the PUBCO M&#38;A Transaction, as well as other routine terms. 

&#160;

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Consulting Agreement or elsewhere, in no event would Thru Pharma be directly and/or indirectly obligated to enter into or complete any particular M&#38;A Transaction, including, but not limited to, any M&#38;A Transaction with the Company. 

&#160; 

Effective July 1, 2015, Thru Pharma and Catalyst Funding, LLC, entered into an Original Issue Discount Revolving Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the &#8220;Catalyst Note&#8221;) and a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Catalyst SPA&#8221;). The transaction is secured by a grant of security interest to 100% of the Company stock held by or for Thru Pharma. The Catalyst Note and Catalyst SPA are intended to facilitate funding essential work relating to multi-year auditing of Thru Pharma financials. The total available funds are $200,000, and Thru Pharma has only drawn $75,000. A Commitment Fee of Company stock in the amount of 35,294 shares was authorized for issue to Catalyst as part of the transaction. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s status as a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as of the date of this report remains unchanged. 

&#160; 

Going Concern 

&#160; 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has not generated any revenues as of October 31, 2015. The Company has incurred losses since Inception (February 23, 2012) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $111,080 as of October 31, 2015 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. The Company currently has no cash balance, a working capital and stockholders&#8217; deficit of $75,232 and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. 

&#160; 

The Company is dependent on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it can be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management&#8217;s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.
