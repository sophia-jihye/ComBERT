Overview 

&#160;

We are a development healthcare company that is currently focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer. Together with our scientific and oncology consultants, we have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds, which together exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading through the body. Our leading products are variations upon our novel formulation and involve or employ pro-enzymes, which are inactive precursors of enzymes. As a result of positive early indications of the anti-cancer effects of our technology, we intend to submit our pro-enzyme treatment to the rigorous, formal non-clinical and clinical development and trial processes required to obtain the regulatory approval necessary to commercialize it and any product(s) derived and/or to be derived therefrom.

&#160;

In the near term, we intend to target patients with limited remaining therapeutic options for the treatment of solid tumors such as colorectal, ovarian or pancreatic tumors. In the future, we intend to develop our lead product to treat early stage cancer and pre-cancerous diseases and as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening.

&#160;

Key Research and Development Highlights: 

&#160; 

&#183; Potential cancer treatment : We are developing a once-daily pro-enzyme treatment as a therapeutic option in cancer treatment and prevention. &#160;

&#183; Multiple mechanisms of action on cancerous or carcinogenic cells : Our treatment exerts multiple effects on cancerous cells, which inhibits tumor growth and potentially stops the tumor from spreading through the body in contrast to cancer treatments currently available that lack sufficient efficacy to achieve a durable clinical response by preventing tumor recurrence or inhibiting new growths which spread through the body. As our research progresses, we intend to explain further the multiple mechanisms of action to identify opportunities to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Furthermore, we hope to uncover the molecular targets of the pro-enzymes to identify potential opportunities for developing new compounds. &#160;

&#183; Encouraging data from patient treatment : Scientific research undertaken over the last 15 years and clinical experience from treating patients in the United Kingdom (the &#8220;UK&#8221;) and Australia has provided evidence that our lead product, PRP, may be an effective treatment against cancer and warrants further development. &#160;

&#183; Animal Efficacy Studies : In November 2015, we completed animal efficacy studies in mice through our contract research partner, vivoPharm, demonstrating proof of concept in vivo . During the course of these studies, we discovered a new target therapeutic dose range using pro-enzymes for treating cancer. That month, we filed a patent application in support of this discovery as further described below. &#160;

&#183; Toxicology Study : In July 2016, we announced the commencement of the in-life phase of a formal 28 day toxicology study (including a toxicokinetic arm designed to determine the relationship between the level of exposure of PRP in the blood and its toxicity) according to Good Laboratory Practice (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) standard, as well as method validation of an infrared dye-labelling method for analyzing the metabolism and distribution of PRP in blood plasma. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Unique intellectual property : We are focusing on building a significant portfolio of intellectual property around the use of pro-enzymes in the treatment of cancer, identifying new formulations, alternative routes of administration and potential new therapeutic targets. The PRP drug product is an enhanced pro-enzyme formulation comprising amylase and pro-enzymes of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen in a specific ratio which synergistically enhances the anti-cancer effects of the pro-enzymes compared to when used as singular entities. Patent protection is currently being sought for this PRP drug product, which forms part of the subject matter of International (PCT) Patent Application No. PCT/AU2010/001403 filed on October 22, 2010 in the name of Propanc Pty Ltd. This international PCT application also includes the priority filings of Australian provisional patent application No. 2009905147 and No. 2010902655, filed on October 22, 2009 and June 17, 2010 respectively (as discussed under the section &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221;). The PRP-DCM drug product also forms part of the subject matter of International (PCT) Patent Application No. PCT/AU2010/001403. National phase applications are being filed in countries around the world based on the above priority applications. In addition, in November 2015, we filed a patent application in Australia in connection with the November 2015 animal efficacy studies. Subsequent applications were filed in Spain and two more in the United States relating to additional discoveries from further cell line studies evaluating the mechanism of action and new compositions of pro-enzymes, respectively. &#160;

&#183; Research and development expenses : During the last two completed fiscal years ending June 30, 2016 and 2015, we have spent $1,446,948 and $134,319, respectively, on research and development expenses. At this stage, the company bears the costs associated with research and development. &#160;

Company History 

&#160;

Propanc Health Group Corporation, formerly Propanc PTY Ltd., is a development stage enterprise incorporated in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on October 15, 2007. Based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia since inception, substantially all of the efforts of our Company have been the development of new cancer treatments targeting high-risk patients who need a long-term therapy that prevents the cancer from returning and spreading. The Company anticipates establishing global markets for its technologies.

&#160;

On November 23, 2010, Propanc Health Group Corporation was incorporated in the state of Delaware. In January 2011, to reorganize the Company, Propanc Health Group Corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY Ltd. on a one-for-one basis making it a wholly owned subsidiary.

&#160;

We were formed for the specific purpose of having stockholders of Propanc PTY Ltd. directly own an interest in a U.S. company. On January 29, 2011, we issued 64,700,525 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), in exchange for 64,700,525 shares of Propanc PTY Ltd. common stock.

&#160;

On July 22, 2016, we formed our subsidiary, Propanc (UK) Limited under the laws of England and Wales for the purpose of submitting an orphan drug application to the European Medicines Agency as a small and medium-sized enterprise.

&#160;

Propanc&#8217;s scientific roots date back almost 100 years to the work of Professor John Beard at the University of Edinburgh in the UK whose pioneering work on tumor cell biology and potential new approaches to treating cancer targeted specific pathways which kill off cancer cells, but leave healthy cells alone. In more recent times interest in the work of Professor Beard has re-emerged, driven by the insights into his work offered with modern day knowledge of tumor cell and molecular biology.

&#160;

Important Milestones for Propanc 

&#160;

&#183; From the late 1990s, work from other scientists and clinicians, including Dr. Josef Novak in the U.S., and a since retired oncologist from the Czech Republic, Dr. Frantisek Trnka, shed new light on the therapeutic potential of Professor Beard&#8217;s insights. Extensive laboratory work undertaken over a number of years by Novak and Trnka was reported in the journal Anticancer Research in 2005 in the paper entitled Pro-enzyme Therapy of Cancer. The conclusion of Novak and Trnka from this work was the discovery &#8220;that pro-enzyme therapy mandated first by John Beard nearly one hundred years ago, shows remarkable selective effects that result in growth inhibition of tumor cells with metastatic potential.&#8221; Today, these important scientific observations support our view that pro-enzymes are selective and effective in targeting malignant tumor cells and could become an effective tool in the fight against metastatic cancer. &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In 2007, Dr. Julian Kenyon, Medical Director of the Dove Clinic in the UK, and Dr. Douglas Mitchell further developed the therapeutic concepts of Beard and identified strategies that could improve upon the therapeutic potential of Beard&#8217;s original ground-breaking work. A suppository formulation was developed by Mandeville Medicines in Buckinghamshire, UK, at the request of, and in consultation with, Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell, in an effort to improve on results reported in the literature pertaining to the potential therapeutic use of pro-enzymes in cancer treatment. Patients were first treated with the suppository formulation in April 2007 at The Dove Clinic in the UK, and in July 2007 at the Opal Clinic in Australia. Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell, through The Dove Clinic and Opal Clinic respectively, treated cancer patients in the United Kingdom and Australia with a suppository formulation of pro-enzymes. The treatment was undertaken under special UK and Australian regulatory provisions. In the UK it was undertaken under the regulations of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the &#8220;MHRA&#8221;), designed for patients who have special clinical needs that cannot be met by licensed medicinal products, and in Australia under the Therapeutic Goods Administration (&#8220;TGA&#8221;) Special Access Scheme, a mechanism that provides for the import and/or supply of an unapproved therapeutic good for a single patient, on a case by case basis. In both jurisdictions, patients are permitted to receive treatment on an individual basis for compassionate use as long it is supplied by a recognized, licensed manufacturer who is able to meet certain guidelines for unapproved products, and individual case files are maintained for patients should the regulatory authorities require this information. No prior approval was required by either the MHRA or TGA prior to the commencement of treatment. No suppository formulation of the pro-enzymes was available and it was necessary for a novel suppository formulation to be manufactured specifically for these patients by a suitably licensed manufacturer. &#160;

&#183; Forty-six late stage cancer patients suffering from a range of malignancies in the UK and Australia received treatment with the pro-enzyme suppositories over periods of time ranging from one month to in excess of 17 months. Inspired by their observations in clinical practice, Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell resolved to develop pro-enzyme therapy for cancer patients worldwide. &#160;

&#183; In late 2007, Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Mitchell and Mr. James Nathanielsz, our chief executive officer, developed a strategy to commercialize the newly developed pro-enzyme formulation, now designated PRP. Propanc PTY Ltd. was established in Australia to refine, develop and commercialize novel, patented pro-enzyme therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. This remains our intention to date. &#160;

&#183; In 2008, a Scientific Advisory Board (the &#8220;Scientific Advisory Board&#8221;) comprising Professor John Smyth (Edinburgh University), Professor Klaus Kutz (Bonn University) and Professor Karrar Khan (De Montfort University) was established. Dr. Ralf Brandt, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of the preclinical Contract Research Organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;), vivoPharm Pty Ltd., was later appointed to the Board in 2011. Today, the expertise of the Scientific Advisory Board in oncology research and development will be relied upon as we initiate patient trials and advance our products down the requisite regulatory pathways to commercialize our pro-enzyme therapies. &#160;

&#183; In 2009, a retrospective review of the patient notes from the 46 patients treated in the UK and Australia with the pro-enzymes suppositories (as described above) was undertaken by Dr. Kenyon. This report was subject to analysis by Professor Klaus Kutz who, at the time of the review, was an independent consultant in clinical pharmacology and safety, specializing in oncology. Professor Kutz observed that no patients were reported as living for a period less than that predicted by the treating clinician and a number of terminally ill patients lived marginally longer than predicted, particularly those suffering from pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian and gastro-intestinal cancers. As a result of the observations made by Dr. Kenyon and Professor Kutz, we are targeting the development of pro-enzyme therapy for the treatment of colorectal and pancreatic cancers for clinical trials, and in the future targeting other cancer types as our product candidate progresses to commercialization. &#160;

&#183; In early 2008, a research collaborative partnership was established with Professor David Tosh at the Center for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Biology and Biochemistry at Bath University, to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the pro-enzyme formulation is acting, which resulted in us filing two provisional patents a year later. We undertook additional scientific research with Professor Tosh, Dr. Macarena P&#232;ran, Department of Health Sciences at Ja&#233;n University, and Dr. Juan Antonio Marchal, Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine Institute at Granada University. Important anti-cancer effects of the pro-enzymes were discovered, including triggering cell necrosis (cell death) and apoptosis (programmed cell death) and significantly, the induction of cell differentiation (i.e. inducing cancer cells to exhibit normal cell behavior). This led to us increasing our intellectual property base and patent new pharmaceutical compositions designed to enhance the effects of pro-enzymes. Subsequently, two provisional patents were combined into one Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Application, filed on October 22, 2010 (PCT Application), and then a year later, we completed a 30 month national phase filing deadline for an international patent and commenced entering the national phase in countries around the world. So far, we received grant status in South Africa and more recently in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) and European Patent Office (&#8220;EPO&#8221;) have made preliminary indications that key features of our technology are patentable and are presently under examination in these two jurisdictions, as well as numerous other countries and regions. We are presently working towards securing a patent in each region, covering as many aspects of our technology as possible, while also actively seeking protection throughout Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In late 2010, we made additional important discoveries and scientific observations, resulting in additional composition claims, which were included in the PCT Application, further protecting the company&#8217;s pro-enzyme formulation. Collaboration with vivoPharm Pty Ltd. (vivoPharm), located in Melbourne, Australia, with research facilities in Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States, identified a highly synergistic ratio of the pro-enzymes when combined together, resulting in increased anti-cancer effects in several tumor cell lines. By 2011, further work completed by vivoPharm confirmed the anti-metastatic effects of the newly combined ratio of the pro-enzymes in various cell line assays, and anti-angiogenic (inhibition of blood vessel formation) properties of the pro-enzyme treatment in mice. &#160;

&#183; In mid-2012, we began trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTCBB&#8221;) and are currently trading on OTCQB under OTC Markets. At the time, whilst located in Melbourne, Australia, we decided to access the US capital markets for raising the capital needed to finance the company&#8217;s pro-enzyme treatment for future clinical trials. Today, after deepening our scientific knowledge of the anti-cancer effects of pro-enzymes through our ongoing efforts with our research partners and strengthening our intellectual property portfolio by filing our patents in countries around the world, we believe we are ready to complete the formal animal studies necessary to undertake human trials in calendar year 2017. &#160;

&#183; In May 2013, it was observed that pro-enzymes enforce the re-entry of cancer cells back into normal cellular pathways and this may represent a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. These findings were published in Cellular Oncology , a peer reviewed journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology. &#160;

&#183; In 2014, after conducting a detailed strategic review of our scientific and preclinical research, our development team determined parenteral administration as the preferred route for the Company&#8217;s lead product, PRP. This approach is expected to maximize results in future patient trials, by ensuring maximum exposure of the drug to the tumor site. &#160;

&#183; Mid 2015, Dr. Joseph Chalil joined our Scientific Advisory Board as an independent expert to provide advice on the Company&#8217;s drug development programs, in particular, Propanc&#8217;s lead product, PRP. Dr. Chalil is a physician and executive at Boehringer Ingelheim, the world's largest privately held pharmaceutical company. &#160;

&#183; In July 2015, a joint research collaboration agreement was established with Adaptive Biotechnologies in Seattle, Washington, a leader in immune-sequencing, which will assist in determining a patient&#8217;s immune response post treatment with PRP. By studying the effects of the immune response post treatment, we plan to more accurately predict patient populations most likely to respond to PRP, as well as explore ways to further enhance the patient&#8217;s immune response during the treatment process. &#160;

&#183; Between July 2015 and February 2016, several scientific research findings were announced demonstrating significant anti-tumor efficacy in several animal models, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers at higher doses when administering pro-enzymes by intravenous injection, dramatic suppression of cancer stems cells in cell culture by altering several key pathways involved with invasion and metastasis, and identification of a synergistic response in a broad range of cancer types including kidney, melanoma, brain, prostate, liver, uterine and lung cancers. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In 2016, we added additional members from our partner universities and hospital to our Scientific Advisory Board, including Dr. Macarena Per&#225;n, who is currently Reader in Anatomy at the University of Ja&#233;n in Spain, Professor Juan Antonio Marchal Corrales, Professor of Anatomy and Embryology at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Granada, and Dr. Maria Garcia, Head of Translational Research at the University Hospital of Granada. &#160;

&#183; In 2016, after completion of a 14 day dose range finding study in rats, a scientific advice meeting was held with the MHRA to discuss the quality development of PRP, the design of a non-clinical 28 day GLP safety toxicology study, and the overall design and response criteria for a proposed Phase I, first-in-man study for PRP. &#160;

The Problem 

&#160;

In the early phases of tumor progression, cancer cells multiply near the site where their predecessors first began uncontrolled proliferation. The result, usually over a long period of time, is a primary tumor mass. Tumors often need to reach a large size before they make themselves apparent to the individual concerned, or the clinician screening for them.

&#160;

Eventually, tumors of substantial size may begin to compromise the functioning of organs in which they have arisen and begin to evoke symptoms. In many cases, the effects on normal tissue function come from the physical pressure exerted by the expanding tumor masses. For example, large tumors in the colon may obstruct digestion products through the lumen, or in the lungs, airways may be compromised.

&#160;

As dangerous and threatening as these primary tumors are, they are ultimately responsible for only about 10% of deaths. A far greater threat often arises for the patient, even after a primary tumor has been identified and removed. This threat involves cancerous growths that are discovered at sites far removed from the locations in their bodies where their primary tumors first appeared. These cancerous growths, called metastases, are responsible for approximately 90% of patient deaths from cancer. Metastases are formed by cancer cells that have left the primary tumor mass and traveled by the body&#8217;s blood and lymphatic vessels (a vein-like vessel carrying lymph, or white blood cells, from the tissues) to seek new sites and form new colonies. For example, breast cancers often spawn metastatic colonies in many tissues throughout the body including the brain, liver, bones, and lungs.

&#160;

For primary tumors which have not yet metastasized, current treatments for cancer can be effective in initially reducing tumor burden. However, for many forms of cancer, current treatments lack sufficient efficacy to achieve a long lasting clinical response. Therefore, a vast majority of patients who succumb to cancer are killed by tumors that have metastasized. According to the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s SEER Cancer Statistics Review (2001 &#8211; 2007), of the patients diagnosed with late stage metastatic breast cancer, only 23% are expected to live longer than five years. This is compared to a 98% five-year survival rate for an early stage breast cancer patient when the cancer is confined to the primary site.

&#160;

The invasion-metastasis cascade 

&#160;

The great majority of life threatening cancers occur in epithelial tissues, yielding carcinomas. Epithelial cells generally have a multi-sided, uniform shape. They have well defined contact points with neighboring cells and a strong attachment to the underlying connective tissue, or stroma, which creates a framework for solid tumors in the body. Separating the two is the specialized type of extracellular matrix, known as the basement membrane.

&#160;

By definition, carcinomas which originate on the epithelial side of the basement membrane and are considered to be benign , as long as the cells forming them remain on the same side. However, many carcinomas acquire the ability to penetrate the basement membrane, and individual cancer cells or groups of cancer cells begin to invade the stroma. This mass of cells is now reclassified as malignant . Often, many pathologists and surgeons reserve the label &#8220;cancer&#8221; for those epithelial tumors that have acquired this invasive ability.

&#160;

Thereafter, carcinoma cells may invade into lymphatic or blood microvessels. The latter may then transport these cancer cells to distant sites in the body where they may be trapped and subsequently form new metastases.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

It is important to note, that even before cells penetrate the basement membrane, they often stimulate angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) on the stromal side of the membrane, by expressing angiogenic proteins through the porous barrier. Not only does this enhance the ability of malignant cells to circulate into the blood, but also provides an important feedback loop for the cancer cell to maintain its invasiveness.

&#160;

Understanding the mechanism by which benign cells change to a malignant state is therefore pivotal to developing anti-cancer treatments that have sufficient efficacy to achieve a long lasting clinical response.

&#160;

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition and associated loss of E-cadherin expression enable carcinoma cells to become invasive. 

&#160;

Epithelial cells can undergo a transformation to a different cell type, called mesenchymal cells, through a process called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (&#8220;EMT&#8221;). Mesenchymal cells have an elongated spindle shape, lack orderly contacts with neighboring cells and can survive without contact with a surface or connective tissue. The EMT process is a series of events that normally occur during the development of tissues and organs prior to birth, and also apply to normal wound healing processes. However, the same EMT process can also be applied to epithelial cancer cells, or carcinomas. When epithelial carcinoma cells residing in a solid tumor undergo the EMT process, the resulting mesenchymal cancer cells can invade through local barriers and metastasize to other parts of the body.

&#160;

In addition to becoming invasive and motile after undergoing the EMT process, the resulting mesenchymal cells have significantly increased resistance to current cancer treatments. For example, in Cancer Research in 2005, it was reported that lung cancer cells expressing mesenchymal biomarkers appeared to be resistant to Tarceva and other targeted anti-cancer agents when transplanted into mice.

&#160;

At the center of this critical process for transforming benign cells into carcinomas, is the protein Epithelial Cadherin (&#8220;E-Cadherin&#8221;). In normal cells, E-cadherin is located in the membrane and involved in maintaining cell to cell contact, which is critical to normal function and structure of epithelial tissues. The individual E-Cadherin molecules are attached to the actin (scaffolding, or cytoskeleton structure) within the cell, anchored by undefined-catenin, a protein which helps form the junction between epithelial cells. As well as forming an anchor between epithelial cells, undefined-catenin is also involved in gene transcription, a process by which DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) is converted into RNA (ribose nucleic acid) within the nucleus of a cell for the purpose of producing new proteins normally associated with routine cell function.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the case of tumors, when cells become invasive, E-Cadherin expression decreases substantially, and undefined-catenin becomes free within the cell, which may then migrate to the nucleus and induce expression of the EMT program. Furthermore, once cells undergo an EMT, they begin to produce their own cytokines (cell signaling molecules), such as Transforming Growth Factor undefined, (&#8220;TGF-undefined&#8221;). This protein plays a critical multi-functional role in promoting angiogenesis, immunosuppression (suppressing the immune system from recognizing and attacking cancer cells), and maintaining their mesenchymal cell structure for prolonged periods via a feedback mechanism. Studies also suggest that TGF-undefined works with undefined-catenin to cause epithelial cancer cells to undergo an EMT.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A study in the British Journal of Cancer , 2011, demonstrated that in cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) cell lines, treatment of TGF-undefined increased cell migration, invasion and mesenchymal changes. Furthermore, expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was measured from resected (cut out) specimens from extra-hepatic (outside the liver) cholangiocarcinoma patients. Patients with low E-cadherin expression had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with high E-cadherin expression. They concluded the cadherin switch via TGF-undefined induced EMT in extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma leads to cancer progression.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Conversely, in studies of several types of carcinoma cells that had lost E-cadherin expression, re-expression of this protein strongly suppressed the invasiveness and motility of these cancer cells.

&#160;

Together, these observations indicate that E-Cadherin levels is a key determinant of the biological behavior of epithelial cancer cells and that the cell to cell contact constructed by E-cadherin molecules impede invasiveness and hence metastasis.

&#160;

Our Solution 

&#160;

Our solution is to develop and commercialize a long-term therapy to prevent tumor recurrence and metastases, the main cause of patient death from cancer. We believe this problem can be addressed by developing a pro-enzyme formulation specifically targeting malignant carcinoma cells to create a long lasting clinical benefit to the patient.

&#160;

Propanc&#8217;s Theory Pro-enzymes Regulate Cell Proliferation 

&#160;

More than 100 years ago, Professor Beard, a comparative embryologist, made an observation that the pancreas develops in most vertebrates at the time when the placenta begins to slow its rate of growth. He hypothesized that enzymes produced by the developing pancreatic gland curtail trophoblastic invasion (a rare condition in which abnormal cells grow inside the uterus from tissue that forms after conception) and suggested that pancreatic extracts should have a similar inhibitory effect on invasive tumors.

&#160;

Subsequently in the late 1990s, after following Professor Beard&#8217;s recommendations, Drs. Novak and Trnka hypothesized that administration of pro-enzymes, rather than the enzymes, was of crucial importance to the clinical effectiveness of the treatment approach first developed by Professor Beard, and that the precursor nature of the active enzymes may offer protection against numerous serpins (proteins which can inhibit pro-enzymes) in the blood.

&#160;

As knowledge of tumor cell and molecular cell biology has increased over the years, our scientists and research partners have made important scientific discoveries identifying that pro-enzymes suppress the EMT program and induce cell differentiation, i.e., return cancerous cells towards normal cell behavior, or a benign state.

&#160;

After more than 100 years, the initial observations made by Professor Beard may have a potential common link between embryogenesis and cancer, by which cells are able to become motile and invasive, via the EMT program, where the administration of pro-enzymes may regulate cell proliferation as a means to controlling carcinomas.

&#160;

Our Product Candidates 

&#160;

We are using our intellectual property and expertise to develop a pro-enzyme therapy for the treatment and prevention of the development of carcinomas from solid tumors. Initially, our products will be used in the treatment of pancreatic and colorectal cancers. In the future, we intend to expand our products scope in anti-cancer treatment to include other common solid tumors such as ovarian, gastrointestinal and prostate cancers.

&#160;

PRP 

&#160;

Our lead product, PRP, is a novel, patented, formulation consisting of two pro-enzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, plus the enzyme amylase (1, 4-undefined-D-glucan glucanohydrolase). In limited human testing as described earlier, supplemented by laboratory research at the Universities of Bath and Granada on the mechanism of action of the pro-enzyme mixture, evidence suggests PRP may be effective against a range of solid tumors.

&#160;

Selectivity 

&#160;

Research published by Novak and Trnka in Anticancer Research (2005) suggests that the pro-enzymes in our product, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, exhibit specificity for tumor cells and not normal cells. Once activated, they in turn activate Protease Activated Receptors Type 2 (&#8220;PAR2&#8221;), which are located on the cell membrane and involved with cancer cell proliferation. Activation of PAR2 results in a cascade of intracellular activities, including activation of a major component of the cell which controls its structure and architecture, the actin cytoskeleton. In a cancer cell, pro-enzymes have the effect of converting globular actin into filamentous actin, which causes the cell structure to collapse and induce cell death. This reduces tumor volume and is often seen in clinical practice.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the enzyme amylase contributes to the anti-tumor activity by splitting the carbohydrate element of glycoproteins on the surface of the tumor cell; this action is facilitated by the activated proteases around the cell.

&#160;

Anti-Cancer Effects and Mechanism of Action 

&#160;

PRP consists of pro-enzymes which are known to influence a number of pathways critical for cancer cells to invade, grow and metastasize. Research published by our research partners in the journal of Cellular Oncology , 2013, shows the clinical benefits of PRP appear to result from enhanced differentiation of tumor cells, which inhibits proliferation and consequently reduces their ability to invade and metastasize.

&#160;

Specifically, we showed that pro-enzymes:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; induce a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, triggering apoptosis and cell necrosis; &#160;

&#160; &#183; enhance expression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and undefined-catenin; &#160;

&#160; &#183; decrease expression of EMT transcription factors responsible for coding specific gene sequences from DNA, associated with TGF-undefined cell signaling pathways; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; induce malignant cells to differentiate to benign forms. &#160;

Once activated, pro-enzymes influence the micro-immune environment around the cell, altering a number of pathways critical for supporting cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis. This includes interacting with proteinases and cell signaling pathways in the extracellular matrix, whilst also interacting directly with cell surface proteins that effect the internal pathways of the cancer cell, triggering re-expression of epithelial markers, reducing important EMT markers, and inducing a series of cellular activities which alters the cancer cell&#8217;s morphology (structure) from a malignant to a benign state.

PRP Activates E-Cadherin and undefined-Catenin Expression, Inhibiting Cell Growth in a Dose Dependent Manner 

&#160;

Initial experiments were performed to determine the effects of PRP on cell growth. Increasing doses of the pro-enzymes in PRP, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, were administered at increasing concentrations on three cancer-derived cell lines, including colorectal (&#8220;Caco-2&#8221;), pancreatic (&#8220;Panc1&#8221;) and esophageal (&#8220;OE33&#8221;) carcinomas.

&#160;

Overall the cell numbers of these three cell lines slightly decreased at concentrations of &#8804;22 &#215; 10 3 ng per mL for both trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, and &#8804;5.15 &#215; 10 3 ng per mL for amylase. However, at &#8804;28 &#215; 10 3 ng per mL for both trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, and &#8804;6.15 &#215; 10 3 ng per mL for amylase, the cell numbers dropped sharply to below 60% and significantly decreased further at higher concentrations, especially for Caco-2 and OE33 carcinoma cell lines. These results suggest that PRP affects cellular growth in a dose dependent manner.

PRP Increases the Expression of Epithelial Markers in Carcinomas 

&#160;

Upon treatment with PRP, changes in expression of the epithelial markers undefined-catenin and E-cadherin were assessed in Caco-2, Panc1 and OE33 cells. Subsequent flow cytometry analysis (flow cytometry is a laser-based technology that quantitate properties of single cells, one cell at a time) revealed that expression of E-cadherin in Caco-2 cells increased to 76.6% &#177; 3.0 when cells were treated with PRP, as compared to a control using untreated cells (15.9% &#177; 4.2).

&#160;

Changes in the expression of undefined-catenin in Caco-2 cells were also observed with an increase from 14.0% &#177; 3.5 in control cells to 78.3% &#177; 0.3 after PRP treatment. E-cadherin expression increased to 42.3% &#177;6.1 and undefined-catenin to 47.1% &#177; 3.3 when Panc1 cells were treated with PRP, while in control cells the respective expression levels were 9.8% &#177; 2.9 and 34.7% &#177;7.4. Finally, PRP treated OE33 cells also showed an increment of both epithelial markers compared to untreated control cells, i.e., E-cadherin increased up to 52.4% &#177;6.8, whereas control cell expression was 8.4% &#177; 2.1, undefined-catenin increased up to 30.2% &#177;4.2, and untreated control cells showed 8.0% &#177;0.7 expression. In all cases differences between untreated and PRP treated cells were statistically significant (p&#60;0.05).

PRP has proven anti-tumor efficacy in Melanoma (B16-F10) Tumor Bearing Mice. 

&#160;

The anti-tumor activity of PRP was assessed in a B16-F10 melanoma model. The tumors were grafted under the skin in C57BL/6 female mice. The tumor-bearing mice were dosed with PRP twice daily, vehicle or control (doxorubicin (Adriblastine&#8482;)) dosed once at 12 mg/kg i.v ( i.e. approximately four-times the clinical dosage based on mg/kg conversion to a 60 kg human) for 28 consecutive days (n = 10 for each group). Treatment began 7 days post-implant.

&#160;

During the course of the experiment, animals were sacrificed if any of the following occurred: signs of suffering (cachexia, weakening, difficulty moving or eating), compound toxicity (hunching, convulsions, diarrhea), tumor growing to 10% of body weight, tumor ulcerating and remaining open, position of tumor interfering with movement/feeding, 15% body weight loss for 3 consecutive days or 20% body weight loss for 1 day. The mice were sacrificed when the tumor volume reached a maximum volume of 2,000 mm.

&#160;

Treatment with PRP was well tolerated following intra-peritoneal (&#8220; i.p. &#8221;) injection into mice. Observations were specifically made to observe any drug-related toxicity (including hunching, convulsions, and diarrhea). There were no adverse events attributable to PRP, nor injection site reactions. Following 21 days treatment (28 days post-implantation), relative tumor volumes (defined as tumor volumes measured x number of days post treatment, divided by the tumor volume measured at day 0 , post treatment) were significantly smaller in the i.p. and adriblastine groups compared to the untreated control.

&#160;

This experiment shows our product, PRP has anti-tumor efficacy in mice, but without the severe, or even serious side effects normally associated with current treatment standards such as chemotherapy.

&#160;

PRP-DCM 

&#160;

To date, we have been focused on developing a novel combination of anti-cancer agents working in combination with pro-enzymes which enhance PRP&#8217;s anti-cancer effects. The enhanced pro-enzymes-based formulations combine PRP with at least one of two types of identified compounds considered on the basis of PRP&#8217;s mechanism of action to synergistically enhance the anti-cancer effects of PRP.

&#160;

Our recent work has focused on maximizing the potential of PRP as a drug suitable for long-term maintenance by enhancing the effects of our current pro-enzyme formulation by screening additional active ingredients to enhance the anti-cancer activity of PRP.

&#160;

Propanc&#8217;s scientists believe the additional ingredients identified in the course of this research to augment anti-cancer activity of PRP may also be suited as a stand-alone, adjunct therapy for standard treatment approaches, such as chemotherapy.

&#160;

Anti-Cancer effects and mechanism of action 

&#160;

Cells obtain the energy they require from aerobic or anaerobic respiration (with, or without oxygen, respectively). It has been suggested that tumor cells rely on anaerobic respiration due to impairment of the mitochondria (an organelle found in most cells, in which the biochemical processes of respiration and energy production occur). We have identified compounds which have pronounced effects on the anaerobic cells within a tumor, which would complement PRP and standard treatment approaches:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a metabolite which inhibits glucose metabolism in cancer cells, as reported in the British Journal of Cancer , 2002; 

&#160; &#183; Capsiate, a non-pungent component from sweet peppers, induces apoptosis by increasing the production of oxygen in cancer cells through forced up-regulation of cell mitochondria, published in the European Journal for Nutrition , 2003; 

&#160; &#183; Methyl-seleno-cysteine, which at low doses increases the oxidative stress on cancer cells by inhibiting a specific enzyme known to be up-regulated in tumor cells, published in Biochemical Pharmacology , 2008. &#160;

Preclinical Development 

&#160;

In November 2010, we established a collaborative research partnership with Dr. Paul Clayton, an expert in cancer prevention and nutrition and former advisor to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (UK), identifying specific anti-cancer agents in combination with one another, and with PRP, enhancing their ability to target cancerous cells with minimal side effects to healthy cells.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of the work undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Paul Clayton, an international PCT application was filed late 2010, detailing enhanced pro-enzyme patent formulations and combination therapies comprising trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Dr. Clayton was awarded a success fee in the form of shares of our common stock representing 1% of the shares then currently issued and outstanding in recognition of his contribution to this research. The patent application is jointly owned by us and the University of Bath, with an exclusive right and license to commercialize any joint intellectual property being held by Propanc (see under License Agreements and Intellectual Property for further details).

&#160;

Effects on Cell Growth Inhibition Alone and in Combination 

&#160;

The interaction that occurs between agents can be described as synergistic, additive or antagonistic. The work we have conducted to enhance the anti-cancer effects of PRP focused on the positive therapeutic outcome of drug interactions, specifically synergism. The major benefits of additive and synergistic drug interactions are increased efficacy and significantly diminished toxic side effects. This can be achieved by reducing the dose of a drug that elicits damaging side effects, through a combination with another drug. Alternatively, a drug with insufficient efficacy could produce super-additive (synergistic) effects in a well-designed combination.

&#160;

IC50 determination assays (the concentration of drug to cause 50% reduction in proliferation of cancer cells) were performed for 2-deoxyglucose, capsiate, methyl-seleno-cysteine and the mixture of these three components (i.e. DCM) in a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT-15. IC50 values were obtained for 2-Deoxyglucose, capsiate and DCM. Methyl-seleno-cysteine treatment of the cells resulted in a maximum growth inhibition of 14.8% at the maximum tested concentration and, therefore, an IC50 value was not obtained.

&#160;

Following the IC50 determination assays, a scientific method was employed to study the interaction between 2-deoxyglucose, capsiate and methyl-seleno-cysteine. We found:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; capsiate, 2-deoxyglucose and DCM are inhibitors of the growth of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT-15 in vitro ; and 

&#160; &#183; methylselenocysteine and 2-Deoxyglucose synergise to inhibit the growth of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT-15. &#160;

We have also made several other similar observations with other compounds that act to inhibit the growth of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT-15. Further work is needed to assess the optimal combination of ingredients before undertaking formal preclinical development of a potential new combination therapy in animals. We will determine a final combination to be developed as an adjunct therapy to PRP.

&#160; 

Preclinical development 

&#160;

The anti-angiogenic efficacy of PRP in combination with DCM was investigated using vivoPharm's AngioChamber&#8482; assay. The AngioChamber&#8482; assay utilizes the normal physiological process of wound healing, to promote fibrous capsule formation around an implanted chamber in mice. The inclusion of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (&#8220;bFGF&#8221;) in the chamber supports the fibrous capsule formation while inducing blood vessel development. Thus, this system is used to assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments by measuring fibrous capsule formation (wet weight of capsule at termination).

&#160;

Fifty female FvB mice each received a subcutaneously implanted AngioChamber&#8482;, with or without bFGF. Ten mice were randomly selected and implanted with Chambers without bFGF. Forty mice which were implanted with Chambers containing bFGF were randomized by body weight into four treatment groups of 10 mice on Day 0 of the study. A reference compound, Sorafenib (60 mg/kg, per oral ) was also introduced into the study.

&#160;

In this Study both treatments resulted in significant inhibition of bFGF-induced angiogenesis compared with the Induction Control, as indicated by the capsule wet weights on the termination day of the study. Both the reference compound, Sorafenib, and the combination of PRP-DCM, significantly reduced angiogenesis.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As is frequently seen in cancer research, animal cancer models using PRP and DCM in combination have in some instances shown very encouraging results, with less clear cut results in other animal models. We are working to understand which models are most appropriate and how to further optimize the DCM formulation as a possible adjunct therapy for use either in combination with PRP, or other standard treatment approaches.

&#160; 

The PRP Formulation 

&#160;

Oral pancreatic enzymes have been administered previously in a variety of circumstances and are in current clinical use in conditions where the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient enzymes for the digestion of food. A number of oral pancreatic enzyme products are presently approved in the U.S. for use in patients who do not produce enough pancreatic enzymes. Approved pancreatic enzyme products include Pancreaze&#8482; from Johnson &#38; Johnson, CREON&#174; from Abbott Laboratories, and ULTRASE&#174; from Axcan Pharma US.

&#160;

PRP is a combination of two pro-enzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, specifically formulated within a specific ratio designed to synergistically enhance their anti-cancer effects and in combination with other therapies identified based on the mechanism of action. Patent protection is currently being sought for PRP and other potential combinations, which forms part of the subject matter of International (PCT) Patent Application No. PCT/AU2010/001403 filed on October 22, 2010 in the name of Propanc PTY Ltd.

&#160;

Oral enzymes have also been investigated previously for the treatment of cancer and, while generating encouraging results, their widespread use has been hampered by the very large quantities that have been considered necessary for effective treatment &#8211; 130 or more tablets per day. The high dose used with oral delivery is considered necessary due to the oral enzymes being broken down in the stomach and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine and very little actually being absorbed into the general circulation. By administering a pro-enzyme parenterally, and using a specific pro-enzyme formulation, the normal breakdown of the enzymes when taken orally is avoided and the drug can potentially be absorbed into the general circulation intact. It is also suggested that pro-enzymes are resistant to inactivation by numerous protein digesting enzymes, like serpins, which are circulating in the blood. Together with our scientific consultants, we believe that the development of a parenteral pro-enzyme formulation will lead to improved efficacy in the treatment of cancer compared with current oral enzyme preparations, and will substantially reduce the dose in comparison to that used previously for oral enzyme therapy for the treatment of cancer.

&#160;

Our Research Programs 

&#160;

POP1 

&#160;

In order to maximize our proprietary knowledge on the use of pro-enzymes in the treatment of cancer, we are currently undertaking research to identify the mechanism at the molecular level by which PRP is acting to cause cancer cell death. A research program has been established with our collaborators at the University of Granada to investigate the changes in genetic and protein expression that occur in cancer cells as a consequence of being exposed to PRP. The objective of this work is to understand PRP&#8217;s impact on molecular level changes in gene expression of the cancer cell post treatment. This will enable us to identify new, patentable drugs, which we can develop such as synthetic recombinant proteins designed to improve the quality, safety and performance of pro-enzymes used in our current formulations.

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Target Indications 

&#160;

The management of cancer differs widely, with a multitude of factors impacting the choice of treatment strategy. Some of those factors include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the type of tumor, usually defined by the tissue in the body from which it originated; 

&#160; &#183; the extent to which it has spread beyond its original location; 

&#160; &#183; the availability of treatments, driven by multiple factors including cost, drugs approved, local availability of suitable facilities, etc.; 

&#160; &#183; regional and geographic differences; 

&#160; &#183; whether the primary tumor is amenable to surgery, either as a potentially curative procedure, or as a palliative one; and 

&#160; &#183; the balance between potential risks and potential benefits from the various treatments and, probably most importantly, the patient&#8217;s wishes. &#160;

For many patients with solid cancers, such as breast, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer, surgery is frequently the first treatment option, often followed by first line chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. While hopefully such procedures are curative, in many instances the tumor returns, and second line treatment strategies are chosen in an effort to achieve a degree of control over the tumor. In most instances, the benefit is temporary, and eventually the point is reached where the patient&#8217;s tumor either fails to adequately respond to treatment, or the treatment has unacceptable toxicity which severely limits its usefulness.

&#160;

Should the proposed Phase I, II and III clinical trials confirm the efficacy of our product candidates, along with the excellent safety and tolerability profile suggested by pre-clinical studies conducted, to date, our product will have utility in a number of clinical situations including:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; in the early stage management of solid tumors, most likely as part of a multi-pronged treatment strategy in combination with existing therapeutic interventions; 

&#160; &#183; as a product that can be administered long term for patients following standard treatment approaches, such as surgery, or chemotherapy, in order to prevent or delay recurrence; and 

&#160; &#183; as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening. &#160;

In the near term, we plan to target patients with solid tumors, most likely colorectal and pancreatic tumors, for whom other treatment options have been exhausted. This is a common approach by which most new drugs for cancer are initially tested. Once efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in this patient population, exploration of the potential utility of the drug in earlier stage disease can be undertaken, together with investigation of the drug&#8217;s utility in other types of cancer.

&#160; 

Development Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to undertake early stage non-clinical and clinical development of our drug products through to a significant value inflection point, where the commercial attractiveness of a drug in development, together with a greater likelihood of achieving market authorization, may attract potential interest from licensees seeking to acquire new products. Such value inflection points in the context of cancer drugs are typically at the point where formal, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated either &#8216;efficacy&#8217; or &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; &#8211; typically meaning that there is controlled clinical trial evidence that the drug is effective in the proposed target patient population, has an acceptable safety profile, and is suitable for further development. From a &#8216;big picture&#8217; perspective, it is our intention to progress the development of our technology through to completion of Phase I clinical trials and then to seek a licensee for further development beyond that point.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As part of that commercial strategy, we will:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; continue research and development to build our existing intellectual property portfolio, and to seek new, patentable discoveries; 

&#160; &#183; seek to ensure all product development is undertaken in a manner that makes its products approvable in the major pharmaceutical markets, including the U.S., Europe, the UK and Japan; 

&#160; &#183; aggressively pursue the protection of our technology through all means possible, including patents in all major jurisdictions, and potentially trade secrets; and 

&#160; &#183; make strategic acquisitions to acquire new companies that have products or services that complement our future goals. &#160;

Development Plan and Milestones 

&#160; 

PRP 

&#160;

We plan to progress PRP down a conventional non-clinical and early stage clinical development pathway either in Central, or Eastern Europe for:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the manufacture of PRP for non-clinical development; 

&#160; &#183; non-clinical safety toxicology studies; 

&#160; &#183; regulatory approval to conduct a Phase I study in the relevant country, and submit it to the applicable regulatory authority for approval; and 

&#160; &#183; Phase I single escalating and multiple escalating dose studies to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PRP injection in healthy male subjects. &#160;

We anticipate reaching the Phase IIa proof of concept milestone in approximately three years, subject to regulatory approval in Europe and the U.S., and the results from our research and development and licensing activities.

&#160;

Our overhead is likely to increase from its current level as our lead product candidate, PRP, progresses down the development pathway. This increase will be driven by the need to increase our internal resources in order to effectively manage our research and development activities.

&#160;

Anticipated timelines 

&#160;

In November 2015, we completed animal efficacy models on PRP. We held a scientific advice meeting with a regulatory agency to discuss our non-clinical and clinical development pathway for PRP in early 2016.

&#160;

In the period from August 2016 to September 2017, we intend to complete the manufacturing, production of drug substance and product for preclinical development activities (including formal safety toxicology studies) and clinical trials. We anticipate the cost to be approximately $1,600,000 and $730,000, respectively.

&#160;

Commencing in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017, we intend to initiate a Phase I study in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors and the anticipated costs will be approximately $900,000.

&#160; 

Non-Clinical Development 

&#160; 

Cell line studies have been performed optimizing the ratio of the two pro-enzymes in our product, PRP. These studies demonstrate synergistic activity over the individual components. Maximum tolerated and feasible dose and pilot animal efficacy studies were undertaken showing no adverse clinical signs at higher doses and substantial tumor growth inhibition in pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Additional pharmacokinetic analysis is underway and toxicology studies will be completed in the near future.

&#160;

Bio-analytical assays for PRP will be developed prior to commencing the dose-range finding studies. In addition, the potential for E-cadherin to be used as a biomarker for PRP activity will be explored.

&#160;

We are planning to develop PRP as a parenteral formulation. Consequently, dose selection for GLP safety toxicology studies will be determined. Twenty-eight day GLP safety studies may also be necessary for PRP.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Clinical Development 

&#160;

It is proposed to perform the first-in-human studies in healthy male subjects as opposed to advanced cancer patients, given the favorable safety profile of PRP which appears less toxic than standard treatments. The studies will assess the safety and tolerability of PRP given either as single or repeated once daily subcutaneous injections compared to placebo under the same conditions. They will be mono-center, double-blind, randomized, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies. It is planned to escalate the dose until a maximum tolerated single dose, and then repeated dose, of PRP is reached. Eight male subjects, followed by twelve male subjects, will be evaluated for the single and repeated dose studies, respectively.

&#160;

After the safety and tolerability studies are completed, a multi-center, open Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PRP administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be conducted. Initially, twenty-three patients will be recruited for the first stage. If two or more responders are identified, thirty-three additional patients will be recruited. The primary objective will be to evaluate the overall survival in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma having received once daily subcutaneous injections of PRP.

&#160; 

POP1 

&#160;

As outlined previously, a research program has been established with our collaborators at the University of Granada to investigate the changes in genetic and protein expression that occur in cancer cells as a consequence of being exposed to our pro-enzyme formulation. The objective of this work is to understand at the molecular level the targets of our pro-enzyme formulation, thereby providing the opportunity for new, patentable drugs which can be developed further. We plan to commence a targeted drug discovery program utilizing the identified molecular target to search for novel anticancer agents.

&#160; 

Financial Objectives 

&#160;

Multiple factors, many of which are outside of Propanc&#8217;s control, can impact the ability of Propanc to achieve its target objectives within the planned time and budgetary constraints. Subject to these caveats, it is Propanc&#8217;s objective to achieve the following R&#38;D milestones within the proposed budget:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; PRP completed Phase I clinical trial; and 

&#160; &#183; Development candidate identified from the POP1 program. &#160; 

Corporate Strategy 

&#160;

We operate as a &#8216;virtual&#8217; company contracting services, skills and expertise as required to achieve our scientific and corporate objectives. As the business grows and gains more personnel, outsourcing will continue to be the preferred model, where fixed and variable costs are carefully managed on a project-by-project basis. This means our research and development activities will be carried out by third parties. So far, we have engaged our research partners from the Universities of Bath and Granada. Additional third parties with specific expertise in research, compound screening and manufacturing (including raw material suppliers) will be contracted as required. Initial discussions have been held with several third parties and will be contracted as we progress into the next stages of the development process.

&#160;

Our initial focus will be to organize, coordinate and finance the various parts of the drug development pipeline. New personnel will be carefully introduced into the company over a period of time as the company&#8217;s research and development activities expand. They will have specific expertise in product development, manufacture and formulation, regulatory affairs, toxicology, clinical operations and business development (including intellectual property management, licensing and other corporate activities).

&#160;

In the first instance, additional clinical management and development expertise is likely to be required for our lead product. Therefore, we anticipate an increase in employees in order to effectively manage our contractors as the projects progress down the development pathway.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

This outsourcing strategy is common in the biotechnology sector, and is an efficient way to obtain access to the necessary skills required to progress a project, in particular as the required skills change as the project progresses from discovery, through manufacturing and non-clinical development and into clinical trials. We anticipate that we will continue to use this model, thereby retaining the flexibility to contract in the appropriate resource as and when required.

&#160;

We intend to seek and identify potential licensing partners for our product candidates as they progress through the various development stages, reaching certain milestones and value inflection points. If a suitable licensee is identified, a potential licensing deal could consist of payments for certain milestones, plus royalties from future sales if the product is able to receive approval from the relevant regulatory authorities where future product sales are targeted. We intend to seek and identify potential licensees based on the initial efficacy data from Phase I clinical trials within the next 18 to 24 months. To accomplish this objective, we have commenced discussions with potential partners in our current preclinical phase of development. If there is sufficient interest in our product during its current phase of development, a potential licensing deal may be identified sooner.

&#160;

As part of our overall expansion strategy, we are investigating potential intellectual property acquisition opportunities to expand our product portfolio. While the Company&#8217;s initial focus is on the development of PRP as the lead product candidate, potential product candidates may also be considered for future preclinical and clinical development. These potential opportunities have arisen from other research and development organizations, which either own existing intellectual property or are currently developing new intellectual property, which may be of interest to us. These opportunities are possible new cancer treatments that are potentially less toxic than existing treatment approaches and are able to fill an existing gap in the treatment process, such as a systemic de-bulking method which could reduce the size and threat of metastases to a more manageable level for late stage cancer patients. We believe these potential treatment approaches will be complementary to existing treatment regimens and our existing product candidate, PRP. No formal approaches have been made at this stage and it is unknown whether we will engage in this discussion in the near future. However, we remain hopeful that as PRP progresses further down the development pathway, future opportunities may arise to use the expertise of our management and scientific personnel for future prospective research and development projects.

&#160; 

Current Operations 

&#160;

We are at a pre-revenue stage. We do not know when, if ever, we will be able to commercialize our products and begin generating revenue. We are focusing our efforts on organizing, coordinating and financing the various aspects of the drug research and development program outlined earlier in this document. In order to commercialize our products, we must complete preclinical development, and Phase I, II and III clinical trials in Europe, the U.S., Australia, or elsewhere, and satisfy the applicable regulatory authority that PRP is safe and effective. If the results from the Phase I and II trials are convincing, we will seek conditional approval from the regulatory authorities sooner. Therefore, we estimate that this will take approximately four years if we seek conditional approval, or up to seven years if we determine that Phase III trials are needed. As described previously, when we advance our development projects sufficiently down the development pathway and achieve a major increase in value, such as obtaining interim efficacy data from Phase I clinical trials, we will seek a suitable licensing partner to complete the remaining development activities, obtain regulatory approval and market the product.

&#160; 

Current Therapies/Drugs Available 

&#160;

We are developing a therapeutic solution for the treatment of patients with advanced stages of cancer targeting solid tumors, which is cancer that originates in organs or tissues other than bone marrow or the lymph system. Common cancer types classified as solid tumors include lung, colorectal, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancers. In each of these indications, there is a large market opportunity to capitalize on the limitations of current therapies.

&#160;

Current therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer offer, at most, a few months of extra life or tumor stabilization. Some experts believe that drugs that kill most tumor cells do not affect cancer stem cells, which can regenerate the tumor (e.g. chemotherapy). Studies are revealing the genetic changes in cells that cause cancer and spur its growth. This research is providing scientific researchers with many potential targets for drugs. Tumor cells, however, can develop resistance to drugs.

&#160; 

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Limitations of Current Therapies 

&#160;

PRP was developed because of the limitation of current cancer therapies. While surgery is often safe and effective for early stage cancer, many standard therapies for late stage cancer urgently need improvement; current treatments generally provide modest benefits, and frequently cause significant adverse effects. Our focus is to provide oncologists and their patients with therapies for metastatic cancer which are more effective than current therapies, and which have a substantially reduced side effect profile.

&#160;

While progress has been made within the oncology sector in developing new treatments, the overall cancer death rate has only improved by 7% over the last 30 years. Most of these new treatments have some limitations, such as:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; significant toxic effects; 

&#160; &#183; expense; and 

&#160; &#183; limited survival benefits. &#160;

We believe that our treatment will provide a competitive advantage over the following treatments:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Chemotherapeutics : Side effects from chemotherapy can include pain, diarrhea, constipation, mouth sores, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, as well as blood-related side effects, which may include a low cell count of infection fighting white blood cells (neutropenia), low red blood cell count (anemia), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Our goal is to demonstrate that our treatment will be more effective than chemotherapeutic and hormonal therapies with fewer side effects . &#160;

&#160; &#183; Targeted therapies : The most common type is multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (molecules which inhibit a specific class of enzymes called kinases). Common side effects include fatigue, rash, hand&#8211;foot reaction, diarrhea, hypertension and dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Furthermore, tyrosine kinases inhibited by these drugs appear to develop resistance to inhibitors. While the clinical findings with PRP are early and subject to confirmation in future clinical trials, no evidence has yet been observed of the development of resistance by the cancer to PRP. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Monoclonal antibodies : Development of monoclonal antibodies is often difficult due to safety concerns. Side effects that are most common include skin and gastro-intestinal toxicities. For example, several serious side effects from Avastin, an anti-angiogenic cancer drug, include gastrointestinal perforation and dehiscence (e.g. rupture of the bowel), severe hypertension (often requiring emergency treatment) and nephrotic syndrome (protein leakage into the urine). Antibody therapy can be applied to various cancer types, but can also be limited to certain genetic sub populations in many instances . &#160;

&#160; &#183; Immunotherapy : There is a long history of attempts to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines to stimulate the body&#8217;s own immune system to attack cancer cells. These products, while they generally do not have the poor safety profile of standard therapeutic approaches, have rarely been particularly effective. While there are a number of therapeutic cancer vaccines currently in development, most are in the early stages of clinical development. To date, only one therapeutic cancer vaccine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. &#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160;

We previously sponsored a collaborative research project at Bath University to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the potential clinical approach of our proprietary pro-enzyme formulation. As a result of this undertaking, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Bath University, dated November 12, 2009 (the &#8220;Commercialization Agreement&#8221;), where, initially, Propanc held an exclusive license with Bath University, and where we and the university co-own the intellectual property relating to our pro-enzyme formulations. The Commercialization Agreement provides for Bath University to assign the Patents (as defined therein) to Propanc in certain specified circumstances, such as successful completion of a Phase I clinical trial and commencement of a Phase IIa (Proof of Concept) clinical trial.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On June 14, 2012, Propanc and Bath University agreed to an earlier assignment of the patents pursuant to an Assignment and Amendment Deed, on the proviso that Bath University retains certain rights arising from the Commercialization Agreement, as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Bath University reserves for itself (and its employees and students and permitted academic sub-licensees regarding Research Use) the non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty free right to use the Patents for Research Use (as defined therein); 

&#160; &#183; The publication rights of Bath University specified in the contract relating to the Original Research (as defined therein) made between the parties with an effective date of July 18, 2008 shall continue in force; 

&#160; &#183; Propanc shall pay to Bath University a royalty being two percent of any and all net revenues; 

&#160; &#183; Propanc shall use all reasonable endeavors to develop and commercially exploit the Patents for the mutual benefit of Bath University and Propanc to the maximum extent throughout the Territory in the Field (as defined therein) and in each Additional Field (as defined therein) and to obtain, maintain and/or renew any licenses or authorizations that are necessary to enable such development and commercial exploitation. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Propanc shall comply with all relevant regulatory requirements in respect of its sponsoring and/or performing clinical trials in man involving the administration of a product or materials within a claim of the Patents; and 

&#160; &#183; Propanc shall take out with a reputable insurance company and maintain liability insurance cover prior to the first human trials. &#160;

We have been working together with Bath University to patent and commercialize these discoveries, while continuing to learn the properties of pro-enzymes with the long-term aim of screening new compounds for development. We are currently engaged in discussions with several technology companies who are progressing new developments in the oncology field as potential additions to our product line. Initially targeting the oncology sector, our focus is to identify and develop novel treatments that are highly effective targeted therapies, with few side effects as a result of toxicity to healthy cells.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have filed an international patent application directed to enhance pro-enzyme formulations and combination therapies comprising trypsinogen and chymotrypsin, and/or a number of other specific anti-cancer agents. The international patent application has been based on previous provisional patent applications filed by us capturing ongoing research and development in this area.

&#160;

The international patent application was filed on October 22, 2010, which claims priority for Australian provisional patent application nos. 2009905147 (filed October 22, 2010) and 2010902655 (filed June 17, 2010).

&#160;

The details of such patent are as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Title: A Pharmaceutical Composition For Treating Cancer Comprising Trypsinogen And/Or Chymotrypsinogen And An Active Agent Selected From A Selenium Compound, A Vanilloid Compound, And A Cytoplasmic Glycolysis Reduction Agent. 

&#160; &#183; Date filed: October 22, 2010. 

&#160; &#183; Jurisdiction: The Patent Cooperation Treaty (the &#8220;PCT&#8221;) is an international agreement for filing patent applications having effect in up to 117 countries. Under the PCT, an inventor can file a single international patent application in one language with one patent office in order to simultaneously seek protection for an invention in up to 117 countries. &#160;

We completed the 30-month national phase filing deadline for this international PCT application and commenced entering the national phase in individual countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, China, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Europe, Russia, India and South Korea. The patent is now granted in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Further, provisional patents are also currently being prepared and expected to be filed to capture and protect additional patentable subject matter that is identified, namely further enhanced formulations, combination treatments, use of recombinant products, modes of action and molecular targets.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

More recently, an Australian provisional patent application (#2015904678) was filed on November 12, 2015, relating to pro-enzyme compositions.

&#160;

On January 29, 2016, a Spanish provisional patent application (#201630112) was filed citing a method to treat cancer by eradicating cancer stem cells while sparing normal stem cells.

&#160;

In February 2016, the Company filed a third patent regarding the use of its lead product, PRP, as a method to treat cancer by targeting cancer stem cell eradication, while sparing normal stem cells.

&#160;

In April 2016, the Company announced the filing of two more patent applications in the United States regarding new compositions of its lead product, PRP, for treating cancer. The inventions summarize difference combinations of the two pro-enzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, which synergistically enhance their anti-cancer effects, compared to when used in a one to one ratio, or as singular agents. &#160;

&#160;

Our intellectual property portfolio also includes an extensive amount of confidential information, know-how and expertise in relation to the development and formulation of our pro-enzyme based combination therapies.

&#160;

The basis of our intellectual property protection will be built around the following elements:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Method of use : Understanding the mechanism of action of the PRP pro-enzyme formulations, enabling the identification of new molecular targets, potential new therapeutic compounds and identification of new formulations that are adapted to enhance activity. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Formulation : We have developed an enhanced formulation containing the pro-enzyme trypsinogen in combination with at least one of two types of identified compounds considered effective for providing synergistic enhancement of the pro-enzyme based formulations. A patentability assessment, based on an international prior art search, has indicated that strong potential exists for successfully obtaining patent claims covering the formulation. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Composition of Matter : Synthetic recombinant proteins designed to improve the quality, safety and performance of pro-enzymes used in the proposed formulations form part of the research and development program. &#160;

Regulatory Issues 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160;

Government oversight of the pharmaceutical industry is usually classified into pre-approval and post-approval categories. Most of the therapeutically significant innovative products marketed today are the subject of New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDA&#8221;). Preapproval activities, based on these detailed applications, are used to assure the product is safe and effective before marketing. In the United States, The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CDER&#8221;), is the FDA organization responsible for over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including most biological therapeutics, and generic drugs.

&#160;

Before approval, the FDA may inspect and audit the development facilities, planned production facilities, clinical trials, institutional review boards and laboratory facilities in which the product was tested in animals. After the product is approved and marketed, the FDA uses different mechanisms for assuring that firms adhere to the terms and conditions of approval described in the application and that the product is manufactured in a consistent and controlled manner. This is done by periodic unannounced inspections of production and quality control facilities by FDA&#8217;s field investigators and analysts.

&#160;

Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Public Health Service Act 

&#160;

Prescription drug and biologic products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labelling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining FDA approval and achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. FDA approval is required before any new drug or biologic, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. All applications for FDA approval must contain, among other things, information relating to safety and efficacy, stability, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labelling and quality control.

&#160; 

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

New Drug Applications (NDAs) 

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s NDA approval process generally involves:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160; &#183; Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 

&#160; &#183; Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product for each intended use; 

&#160; &#183; Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s &#8220;current good manufacturing practice&#8221; (&#8220;CGMP&#8221;) regulations; and 

&#160; &#183; Submission to and approval by the FDA of a NDA. &#160;

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and Propanc cannot guarantee that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of toxicity and immunogenicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) covering each medical center proposing to conduct clinical trials must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive &#8220;good clinical practice&#8221; (&#8220;GCP&#8221;) regulations, which include requirements that all research subjects provide informed consent and that all clinical studies be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators.

&#160;

For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Phase I: Initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety and dose tolerance; 

&#160; &#183; Phase II: Generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase III clinical trials; 

&#160; &#183; Phase III: Commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase II evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, replicate evidence of safety and effectiveness needs to be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials of a product candidate for a specific indication. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide adequate basis for product labelling; and &#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Phase IV: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a NDA on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product&#8217;s safety, purity and potency after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. &#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Concurrent with clinical studies, sponsors usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with CGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Moreover, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with the aforementioned manufacturing information, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA. NDA&#8217;s must also contain extensive manufacturing information. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;), the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review is applied to products that offer at most, only minor improvement over existing marketed therapies. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe, although a review can take significantly longer. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A Priority Review takes the FDA six months to review a NDA. It is likely that our product candidates will be granted Standard Reviews. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.

&#160;

The FDA may deny approval of a NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or additional pivotal Phase III clinical trials. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than Propanc. Once issued, product approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (&#8220;REMS&#8221;), and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labelling or manufacturing processes or facilities, approval of a new or supplemental NDA may be required, which may involve conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

&#160;

Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

After approval, products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records, submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.

&#160;

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Propanc, and any manufacturers of our products, are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before Propanc can use them to manufacture products. Propanc and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.

&#160;

With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

&#160;

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. A NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing a NDA.

&#160;

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

&#160; 

European Union 

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, Propanc will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not Propanc obtains FDA approval for a product, Propanc must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before Propanc can commence clinical trials or market our product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may differ than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

&#160;

Under European Union regulatory systems, Propanc must submit and obtain authorization for a clinical trial application in each member state in which Propanc intends to conduct a clinical trial. After Propanc has completed clinical trials, Propanc must obtain marketing authorization before it can market its product. Propanc must submit applications for marketing authorizations for oncology products under a centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The European Medicines Agency (the &#8220;EMA&#8221;) is the agency responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines that are to be assessed via the centralized procedure.

&#160;

Australia 

&#160;

In Australia, the relevant regulatory body responsible for the pharmaceutical industry is the Therapeutics Goods Administration (the &#8220;TGA&#8221;). Prescription medicines are regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Under the Therapeutic Goods Act, the Therapeutic Goods Administration evaluates new products for quality, safety and efficacy before being approved for market authorization, according to similar standards employed by the FDA and EMA in the United States and European Union, respectively. However, receiving market authorization in one or two regions does not guarantee approval in another.

&#160; 

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160;

Although none of our product candidates have been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels.

&#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160;

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our technology platforms, product candidates, know-how, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

&#160;

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 28, 2016, we have one full-time employee and one part-time employee. Over time, we may be required to hire employees or engage independent contractors to execute various projects that are necessary to grow and develop our business. These decisions will be made by our officers and directors, if and when appropriate.
