We provide our clients with best-of-breed service capabilities offered as a complete end-to-end solution or on an &#224; la carte basis. Marketed as PFSweb&#8217;s End2End eCommerce &#174; solution the services we offer are organized into the following categories:

&#160; 

Our solutions support direct-to-consumer (&#8220;DTC&#8221;), business-to-business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;), and retail sales channels. The majority of our clients are the merchants of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure on their behalf. For these clients, we do not own the inventory or the resulting accounts receivable, but provide ecommerce solutions and other services for these client-owned assets. 

For some of our clients, we are the merchant of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure. Depending on the terms under these arrangements, we record either product revenue or service fee revenue, may own the accounts receivable and inventory and we may be compensated for all or a portion of our services through the resulting profit margin. In some of these client relationships, we purchase the inventory as the product is delivered to our facility. In other of these client relationships, the client retains ownership of inventory in our facility and we purchase the inventory immediately prior to each individual customer sales transaction. In all of these cases, we seek inventory financing from our clients in the form of extended terms, working capital programs or marketing funds to help offset the working capital requirements that follow accounts receivable and inventory ownership. 

&#160;

We are headquartered in Allen, Texas where our executive and administrative offices and our primary technology operations and facilities are located, and certain professional services including digital agency and technolog y services are performed. We operate state-of-the-art call centers from our U.S. facility located in Dallas, Texas and from our international facilities located in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada and Li&#232;ge, Belgium. We lease or manage warehouse facilities o f approximately 1. 7 million square feet, many containing highly automated and state of the art material handling and communications equipment in Memphis, Tennessee, Southaven, Mississippi, Richmond Hill , Ontario, Canada and Li&#232;ge, Belgium, allowing us to p rovide global distribution solutions. Additionally, we engage in business development activities and provide additional digital agency services and/or technology services from our offices in Minneapolis, New York City, Seattle, London, Munich, Sofia and B angalore. 

PFSWEB&#8217;S END2END ECOMMERCE &#174; SOLUTIONS 

PFSweb serves as the &#8220;brand behind the brand&#8221; for companies seeking to increase efficiencies, enter new markets or launch optimized sales channels. As an eCommerce development firm, digital agency and business process outsourcer, we offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for brand manufacturers, online retailers, and distributors across a wide range of industry segments. We provide our clients with seamless and transparent solutions to support their business strategies, allowing them to focus on their core competencies. Leveraging PFSweb&#8217;s technology, expertise and proven methodologies, we enable clients to develop and deploy new products and implement new business strategies or address new distribution channels rapidly and efficiently through our optimized solutions. Our clients engage us both as a consulting partner to assist them in the design of a business solution as well as a virtual and physical infrastructure partner to provide the mission critical operations required to build and manage their business solution. Together, we not only help our clients define new ways of doing business, but also provide them the technology, physical infrastructure and professional resources necessary to quickly implement their business model. We allow our clients to quickly and dramatically change how they &#8220;go-to-market.&#8221; 

Each client has a unique business model and unique strategic objectives that often require highly customized solutions. PFSweb supports clients in a wide array of industries, including fashion apparel and accessories, fragrance and beauty products, consumer packaged goods, home furnishings and housewares, collectibles and toys and technology products. These clients turn to PFSweb for help in addressing a variety of business needs that include strategic consulting, eCommerce creative design and development, customer satisfaction and retention, time-definite logistics, vendor managed inventory and integration, supply chain compression, cost model realignments, transportation management and international expansion, among others. We also act as a constructive agent of change, providing clients the ability to alter their current distribution model, establish direct relationships with end-customers, and reduce the overall time and costs associated with existing distribution channel strategies. Our clients are seeking solutions that will provide them with dynamic supply chain and multi-channel marketing efficiencies, while ultimately delivering a world-class customer service experience. 

Our value proposition is to become a seamless, well integrated extension of our clients&#8217; enterprises by delivering superior solutions that drive optimal customer experiences. On behalf of the brands we serve, we strive to increase and enhance sales and market growth, bolster customer satisfaction and customer retention, and drive costs out of the business through operations and technology related efficiencies. As both a virtual and a physical infrastructure for our clients&#8217; businesses, we embrace their brand values and strategic objectives. By utilizing our services, our clients are able to: 

Quickly Capitalize on Market Opportunities. Our solutions empower clients to rapidly implement their supply chain and eCommerce strategies and take advantage of opportunities without lengthy integration and implementation efforts. We have readily available advanced technology and physical infrastructure that is flexible in its design, which facilitates quick integration and implementation. The PFSweb solution is designed to allow our clients to deliver consistent quality service as transaction volumes grow and also to handle daily and seasonal peak periods. Through our international locations, our clients can sell their products broadly throughout the world. 

Improve the Customer Experience. We enable our clients to provide their customers with a high-touch, positive buying experience thereby maintaining and promoting brand loyalty. Through our use of advanced technology, we can respond directly to customer inquiries by e-mail, voice or data communication and assist them with online ordering and product information. We believe we offer our clients a &#8220;world-class&#8221; level of service, including Web-enabled customer care service centers, detailed Customer Relationship Management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) reporting and exceptional order accuracy. We have significant experience in the development of eCommerce storefronts that allows us to recommend features and functions easily navigated and understood by our clients&#8217; customers. Our technology platform is designed to ensure high levels of reliability and fast response times for our clients&#8217; customers. Because of our technology, our clients benefit from being able to offer the latest in customer communication and response conveniences to their customers. 

Minimize Investment and Improve Operating Efficiencies. One of the most significant benefits outsourcing provides is the ability to transform fixed costs into variable costs. By eliminating the need to invest in a fixed capital infrastructure, our clients&#8217; costs 

&#160;

typically become more directly correlated with v olume increases or declines. Further, as volume increases drive the demand for greater infrastructure or capacity, we are able to quickly deploy additional resources. We provide services to multiple clients, which enables us to offer our clients economies of scale, and resulting cost efficiency, that they may not have been able to obtain on their own. Additionally, because of the large number of daily transactions we process, we have been able to justify investments in levels of automation, security surveil lance, quality control processes and transportation carrier interfaces that are typically outside the scale of investment that our clients might be able to cost justify on their own. These additional capabilities can provide our clients the benefits of enh anced operating performance and efficiency, reduced inventory shrinkage, and expanded customer service options. 

Access a Sophisticated Technology Ecosystem. We provide our clients with access to a Technology Ecosystem featuring best-of-breed eCommerce technologies together in a single, integrated, PCI certified offering. Powered by leading enterprise-class software solutions, our platform is seamlessly integrated into PFSweb's back-end operations to provide an end-to-end eCommerce solution. Built to accelerate the implementation process, the Technology Ecosystem allows for flexible integrations with other technology providers and client systems. 

Our Technology Ecosystem also extends beyond the digital world and into physical commerce channels. Brands and retailers today require flexible technology to control customer shopping experiences regardless of where they shop. Deploying ship from store, in-store pick up, or mobile point of sale capabilities are just a few examples of how PFSweb can enable brands to create a dynamic and unique omni-channel shopping experience. 

We believe our highest value proposition is achieved when our clients engage our full suite of services from all of the categories included in PFSweb&#8217;s End2End eCommerce &#174; solutions. However, we provide our clients with the opportunity to customize their solution by selecting only certain services from our offering in &#224; la carte fashion if they prefer. We believe this flexibility and willingness to create a customized solution for each client differentiates us from our competition. 

Strategic Commerce Consulting Services

Our strategic commerce consulting practice leverages our commerce channel management capabilities along with extensive consumer package goods (&#8220;CPG&#8221;), retail, and B2B vertical expertise to assist our clients in identifying new opportunities for revenue/margin growth, new customer/segment acquisition, market expansion, and cost savings. We also monitor emerging technologies and trends, with an eye to measuring business impact and alignment with our clients&#8217; end goals. With a focus on industry trends, we seek to optimize clients&#8217; commerce investments while anticipating strategic opportunities and threats.

Our clients seek help navigating an increasingly complex digital landscape, with lowering barriers to market for new players and an array of options for companies looking to innovate. We work closely with client stakeholders to develop strategic and prioritization frameworks that drive change while providing the ability to pivot as threats or opportunities are identified. In particular, our consultants focus on three key areas that enable clients to remain competitive while taking a leadership position: commerce ecosystem management (including omni-channel alignment), digital opportunity analysis, and a &#8220;continuous beta&#8221; operational model to roll out new capabilities and tactics in a measurable yet timely fashion.

Commerce Strategy. From identifying new markets and methods to drive higher revenue to competitive and market analysis, we help clients formulate strategies and tactics that work. In our strategy work, we look to leverage existing assets, personnel, and processes wherever possible while identifying where investment is needed. We also offer roadmaps and initiative &#8220;backlogs&#8221; prioritized for impact, with guidance on taking a phased approach. 

Digital Opportunity Audits . Our consultants help clients identify where new digital platforms, tools, and technologies can provide competitive advantage or bridge gaps in their current operations and capabilities. Audits can take into account the competitive landscape, industry trends, digital best practices across verticals, and cost models, providing helpful benchmarks and flagging areas of opportunity. Audits may be conducted periodically to track changes and emerging technologies and measure effectiveness. 

Organizational/Operational Readiness. Many PFSweb clients require some organizational readiness consulting to ensure they can utilize effectively the platforms and tools we provide. Providing readiness consulting is crucial to driving client satisfaction and confidence when adopting commerce platforms, particularly when business users are given new capabilities and may need to adapt existing business processes. We also provide organizational design consulting, which is often implemented in a phased approach as the client&#8217;s commerce channel grows; this may include recommendations regarding which functions to outsource and which to maintain in house. 

Omni-Channel Consulting . Retail clients are concerned with increased consumer expectations for a holistic, seamless experience regardless of where or when they shop, in store or online. We offer an array of services that help retailers meet consumer 

&#160;

expectations across the commerce lifecycle, f rom customer acquisition through the transaction, order fulfillment, customer service, and loyalty. In particular, we implement tools and processes to support &#8220;endless aisle&#8221; inventory access, ship to store and ship from store capabilities, buy online and return in-store, and similar delivery scenarios. Likewise, we consult with retailers on leveraging digital tools within the store environment, whether enabling sales associates to prevent walk outs or consumers to enhance their product experience. 

Platform Evaluation/Selection. Our strategists take the lead in helping clients evaluate and select the right commerce platforms, leveraging our expertise implementing all market-leading solutions. We walk clients through a process matching their requirements to platform capabilities, measure their operational ability to utilize the platforms under consideration, and provide total cost of ownership (TCO) models comparing initial and ongoing costs for everything from software licensing models to ongoing maintenance and upgrades. 

Agency Services 

LiveArea, the PFSweb Agency, is a full-service digital retail agency. We help world-leading brands engage customers and optimize eCommerce practices. Combining best practices, creativity, and a customer-centric approach, we create world-class digital experiences and deliver tangible results. 

Our strategic approach addresses the entire customer journey. From brand strategy and flagship experiences to the day-to day mechanics of marketing services, we help brands stand apart from competitors, connect with customers and drive revenue. Our end-to-end, omni-channel expertise allows us to have a holistic marketing strategy, from awareness and attraction to conversion and optimization. 

Digital Strategy

We build digital strategies to target the intersection of our client&#8217;s goals, brand and customers. Informed by in-depth and ongoing collaboration with the client, data-based insight and practiced expertise, we craft actionable plans that deliver results. We specialize in adapting to the changing market, emerging technologies, and evolving customer behavior.

Creative 

We conceive, design, and write with a deliberate focus on balancing creativity and usability. We believe a beautiful or fun or inspiring vision is only as good as the experience's ability to continually engage customers and drive conversion. Our brand-inspired, user-centered approach creates positive connections that turn customers into brand ambassadors.

User Experience

By examining how customers actually interact with the brand and digital properties, we refine and improve on-site practices to increase satisfaction and conversion.

We strategically combine tactics for efficiency and effectiveness and can coordinate with offline programs, to help intelligently drive results across all shopping channels.

Affiliate Marketing

Our approach to affiliates focuses on building relationships with appropriate online influencers to help improve brand awareness and efficiently increase sales quickly and efficiently.

&#160;

Product Merchandising 

We focus on dynamic merchandising to create engaging and personalized shopping experiences. Through behavior-based promotion setup, on-site search optimization, and Website A/B testing, we convert shoppers into buyers.

Email Marketing

Our data focused approach to email marketing helps increase our clients&#8217; ROI. We plan, design, and test email across custom segments to ensure our clients&#8217; customers get messages they find interesting and motivating.

Digital Analytics

We employ powerful reporting techniques and expert analysis to provide key insights and actionable recommendations that can make our clients&#8217; business more intelligent, efficient, and successful.

Learning Lab

Technology Services 

PFSweb's Technology Services builds world-class eCommerce websites that are designed to maximize revenue opportunities. Built by a seasoned group of professionals, we combine strategy and technology to create innovative user experiences. From high-fashion apparel to consumer packaged goods, our portfolio consists of brands that accept only the highest quality shopping websites.

We use a proven methodology to deliver quality implementations to meet some of the strictest brand requirements in the industry. Our project teams are comprised of industry-leading professionals that bring eCommerce and web development best practices to our clients&#8217; custom solutions. Once live, our team applies the same level of excellence to ongoing development, site maintenance, and solutions support.

Direct-to-Consumer eCommerce (&#8220;DTC&#8221;). Established in 2008, PFSweb&#8217;s End2End eCommerce &#174; solution for the DTC online channel features Demandware Commerce Cloud. As a Demandware Strategic Solution and End-to-End Partner, we are one of the premier Demandware development organizations. We have become one of the largest international Demandware development teams in the world and maintain a talented team of Demandware certified developers who create world-class user experiences for some of the world's leading brands. We have fully integrated Demandware with the rest of our world-class technology platform, including other best-of-breed technology partners, to create a PFSweb reference application that provides our clients with a very high-function DTC online store out-of-the-box. We are able to use the PFSweb reference application as a starting point to quickly create a completely customized online store for our DTC clients. Designed specifically for DTC brands, our comprehensive offering redefines end-to-end eCommerce by enabling retailers and branded consumer goods manufacturers with the ability to employ a total outsourcing solution customized to their particular eCommerce strategy, without the loss of site or brand control associated with earlier end-to-end outsourcing solutions. 

Through the 2014 acquisition of REV Solutions, Inc., an eCommerce systems integrator, we enhanced our Demandware practice and broadened the portfolio of technology services with the addition of Oracle Commerce. As an Oracle Gold Partner, we launch commerce initiatives for major brands. Oracle Commerce (which now includes ATG and Endeca) is a leading platform consisting of commerce applications to provide seamless customer experiences across multiple touch points. We continue to innovate with Oracle Commerce to drive sales, reduce cycle times, decrease costs, and improve service levels for our clients. In 2015, acquisitions of Moda Superbe Limited (&#8220;Moda&#8221;), a London based systems integrator, added additional development expertise on the Magento commerce platform and CrossView, Inc., (&#8220;CrossView&#8221;) added experienced development and support on IBM Websphere and hybris ecommerce platforms.

&#160;

eCommerce Development. With expertise on the five major e-commerce platforms , our staff is ready to build custom eCommerc e solutions for our clients. We employ a proven development methodology, led by a highly-qualified team of solutions architects, web developers, project managers, and Quality Assurance (&#8220;QA&#8221;) testers. When paired with our Strategic Commerce Consulting Serv ices and our Agency Services, we can provide an entire suite of services that spans strategy, creative, project management, web development, and quality assurance. 

Platform Support . Our work doesn't stop when we launch an eCommerce site. Our Platform Support team provides real-time management and monitoring to ensure our clients&#8217; sites are always operating at peak performance. We provide Level 1/2/3 technical, business, and solutions support for optimal issue management. 

Quality Assurance. Whether it's a new site build or ongoing development, our team of QA experts employ a full-service test suite that includes quality assurance scripting and testing, regression, load testing, and automation. 

Training. We provide on-site, personalized platform training from experienced subject-matter experts. Our training team empowers our clients&#8217; business and merchandising staff with the knowledge they need to operate and optimize their eCommerce sites. Core training includes platform essentials, advanced merchandising, front-end design, and developer training. 

Omni-Channel Operations 

Our Omni-Channel Operations services provide the operational activities required and expected of the world's leading brands. We have DTC and B2B experience in customizing solutions to meet the unique nuances of our clients&#8217; internal finance, customer care, and supply chain operations. With approximately 1.7 million square feet of leased or managed distribution space and approximately 1,000 call center seats across two continents, we have the global infrastructure to meet the operational needs of our eCommerce and traditional B2B clients.

As the operational backbone of the online and B2B shopping experience, we focus on three core actions: to deliver, to communicate, and to fulfill the promise behind each brand we support.

Order Fulfillment 

We design advanced pick-pack-ship operations that streamline our clients&#8217; supply chain process and offer a flexible fulfillment distribution model. Our fulfillment team understands the value of the delivery experience by specializing in creating branded solutions with gift wrap and other branded services. Our distribution centers are located in the Memphis area, Toronto, and Belgium to provide centrally located fulfillment throughout North America and Europe.

Advanced Distribution Facilities and Infrastructure. An integral part of our solution is the warehousing and distribution of our clients&#8217; inventory. We receive inventory in our distribution centers, verify shipment accuracy, unpack and audit packages (a process that includes spot-checking a percentage of the inventory to validate piece counts and check for damages that may have occurred during shipping, loading and unloading). Upon request, we inspect for other damages or defects, which may include checking fabric, stitching and zippers for soft goods, or &#8216;testing&#8217; power-up capabilities for electronic items as well as product specifications. We generally stock for sale within one business day of unloading. We pick, pack and ship customer orders and can provide customized packaging, customized monogramming, personalized laser engraving, capabilities of high volume shrink packaging, inserts and promotional literature for distribution with customer orders. For many clients, we provide gift-wrapping services including line level gifting, customized gift-wrapping paper, ribbon, gift-box and gift-messaging. 

Our distribution facilities contain computerized sortation equipment, flexible mobile pick-to-light carts, powered material handling equipment, scanning and bar-coding systems and automated conveyors and in-line scales. Our distribution facilities include several advanced technology enhancements, such as radio frequency technology in product receiving processing to ensure accuracy, as well as an automated package routing and a pick-to-light paperless order fulfillment system. Our advanced distribution systems provide us with the capability to warehouse an extensive number of stock keeping units (SKUs), ranging from large high-end electronics to small cosmetic compacts. Our facilities are flexibly configured to process B2B and DTC orders from the same central location. 

In addition to our advanced distribution systems, our pick-to-light carts, stationary pick-to-light areas and conveyor system controls provide real time productivity reporting, thereby providing our management team with the tools to implement productivity standards. This combination of computer-controlled equipment provides the seamless integration of our pick-to-light systems and mass sortation capabilities. This unique combination of technologies ensures high order accuracy for each and every customer order. 

&#160;

We are able to take advantage of a variety of shipping and delivery options, which range from next day service to zone skipping, to optimize transportation costs. Our facilities and systems are e quipped with multi-carrier functionality, allowing us to integrate with all leading package carriers and provide a comprehensive freight and transportation management offering. 

We offer reverse logistics management services, including issuing return authorizations, return carrier shipping labels, receipt of product, crediting customer accounts and disposition of returned product. We also leverage strategic partnerships to provide our clients with access to distributed returns centers that collect, consolidate, report on and forward to our central facilities returned product allowing us to accelerate credits to our clients&#8217; customers, reduce freight costs for our client, improve customer service and reduce complexity and cost in our facilities from handling inbound returns.

Our domestic facilities provide trained security professionals from our security headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee and Southaven, Mississippi. Continual validation and the use of current and retired law enforcement professionals ensures that we employ the latest in security processes and procedures to further enhance our surveillance and detection capabilities. 

Facility Operations and Management. Our facilities management service offering includes distribution facility design and optimization, business process reengineering and ongoing staffing and management. Along with our multi-brand operations in Mississippi and Tennessee, we also manage a dedicated client-owned/leased facility on behalf of one client: a DTC facility in Memphis, Tennessee for a major retailer. Our expertise in supply chain management, logistics and customer-centric fulfillment operations extends through our management of client-owned/leased facilities, resulting in cost reductions, process improvements and technology-driven efficiencies. 

Kitting and Assembly Services. Our expanded kitting and assembly services enable our clients to reduce the time and costs associated with managing multiple suppliers, warehousing hubs, and light manufacturing partners. As a single source provider, we provide the advantage of convenience, accountability and speed. Our kitting and assembly services include light assembly, specialized kitting and supplier-consigned inventory hub either in our distribution facilities or co-located elsewhere. We also offer customized light manufacturing and supplier relationship management (&#8220;SRM&#8221;). 

We work with clients to re-sequence certain supply chain activities to aid in an inventory postponement strategy. We can provide kitting and assembly services and build-to-stock thousands of units daily to stock in a Just-in-Time (&#8220;JIT&#8221;) environment. This service, for example, can entail the procurement of packaging materials including retail boxes, foam inserts and anti-static bags. These raw material components may be shipped to us from domestic or overseas manufacturers, and we will build the finished SKUs to stock for the client. Also included is the custom configuration of high-end printers and servers. This strategy allows manufacturers to make a smaller investment in base unit inventory while meeting changing customer demand for highly customizable products. 

Our standard capabilities include: build-to-order, build-to-stock, expedited orders, passive and active electrostatic discharge (&#8220;ESD&#8221;) controls, product labeling, serial number generation, marking and/or capture, lot number generation, asset tagging, bill of materials (&#8220;BOM&#8221;) or computer automated design (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) engineering change processing, SKU-level pricing and billing, manufacturing and metrics reporting, first article approval processes, and comprehensive quality controls. 

Kitting and inventory hub services enable clients to collapse supply chains into the minimal steps necessary to prepare product for distribution to any channel, including wholesale, mass merchant retail, or direct to consumer. Clients no longer have to employ multiple providers or require suppliers to consign multiple inventory caches for each channel. We offer our clients the opportunity to consolidate operations from a channel standpoint, as well as from a geographic perspective. Our integrated, global information systems and international locations support business needs worldwide. 

Product Management and Inspection Services. We also operate a coupon management system and product management program. Coupons are managed and activated by a unique serial number, thus significantly reducing fraudulent activity. Our capabilities also extend into salvage operations, allowing our clients to reclaim valuable raw materials and components from discontinued or obsolete inventory. 

We operate a test and repair center where we visually inspect items for cosmetic defects. These items are put through rigorous testing that includes: functionality, durability, accessory inspection and packaging. Items that pass the testing are repackaged and resold with a noted exception of &#8220;open-box&#8221; merchandise. Items that fail the inspection are disassembled and working spare parts are saved for future use in repairs. 

&#160;

Customer Care 

Our internal call center operations are focused on providing essential services such as order entry, returns authorization, and order tracking. These operations also include our iCommerce Agent (&#8220;iCA&#8221;), a customizable web-based application featuring powerful customer service tools for accessing all required customer information. Our unique multi-lingual capabilities are possible through our strategically placed locations in Dallas, Belgium and Toronto.

Customer Relationship Management. Through our web enabled CRM platform, iCA, our unique technology leverages the client&#8217;s website investment by wrapping CRM capabilities around the existing website. Through iCA, agents provide customer service functions, such as placing orders, checking order status, facilitating returns, gathering &#8220;voice of the customer&#8221; information, initiating upsell and cross sell, and managing escalations. iCA is fully integrated into the client&#8217;s website front end and our data analytics platform and order processing system, allowing full visibility into customer history and customer trends. Through each of our customer touch-points, information can be analyzed and processed for current or future use in business evaluation, product effectiveness and positioning, and supply chain planning. Through this fully integrated system, we are able to provide a complete customer care solution in a PFSweb customer care center or on a license basis to our clients&#8217; owned or outsourced customer care centers. 

Customer Assistance. An important feature of evolving commerce is the ability for the customer to speak with a live customer service representative. Our experience has been that many consumers tell us they visited the web location for information, but not all of those consumers chose to place their order online. Our customer care services utilize features that integrate voice, e-mail, standard mail, fax, data and Internet chat communications to respond to and handle customer inquiries. Our customer care representatives answer various questions, acting as virtual representatives of our clients&#8217; organization, regarding order status, shipping, billing, returns and product information and availability as well as a variety of other questions. Our web-enabled customer care technology identifies each customer contact automatically and routes it to the appropriate customer care representative who is individually trained in the clients&#8217; business and products. 

Our web-enabled customer care centers are flexibly designed so that our customer care representatives can handle either several different clients and products in a shared agent environment, thereby creating economy of scale benefits for our clients, or through a highly customized dedicated agent support model that provides the ultimate customer experience and brand reinforcement. 

Quality Monitoring. Quality is essential in our client solutions. As representatives of our clients, our customer care representatives must adhere to the unique quality standards of each client. We continually monitor the quality of our customer care representatives against each client quality standard and use the results to provide agent-level feedback to continually improve the customer care experience. Clients may participate in the quality process by remotely listening to calls, assisting in the grading of recorded calls, and providing ongoing direction to improve quality standards. 

Customer Self-Help. With the need for efficiency and cost optimization for many of our clients, we have integrated interactive voice response (&#8220;IVR&#8221;) as another option for customer contacts. IVR creates an &#8220;electronic workforce&#8221; with virtual agents that can assist customers with vital information at any time of the day or night. IVR allows for our clients&#8217; customers to deal interactively with our system to handle basic customer inquiries, such as account balance, order status, shipment status, catalog requests, product and price inquiries, and routine order entry for established customers. The inclusion of IVR in our service offering allows us to offer a cost effective way to handle high volume, low complexity calls. 

Financial Services 

Protecting our clients&#8217; brand with secure payment processing and fraud management services is critical to a successful operation. We also provide flexible global payment options as well as gift cards, B2B invoicing, and VAT services.

Our financial services are divided into two major areas: 1) billing, credit, collection and cash application services for B2B clients and 2) fraud review, chargeback management and processing and settlement of credit card services for DTC clients. 

Business-to-Business Financial Management. For B2B clients, we offer full-service accounts receivable management and collection capabilities, including the ability to generate customized computer-generated invoices in our clients&#8217; names. We assist clients in reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding, while minimizing costs associated with maintaining an in-house collections staff. We offer electronic credit services in the format of EDI and XML communications direct from our clients to their vendors, suppliers and retailers. 

Direct-to-Consumer Financial Management. For DTC clients, we offer secure credit card processing related services for orders made via a client web site or through our customer contact center. We offer manual credit card order review as an additional level of 

&#160;

fraud protection. We also calculate sales taxes, goods and services taxes or value added taxes, if applicable, for numerous taxing authorities and on a variety of products. Using third-party leading-edge fraud protection services and risk management systems, we can offer high levels of security and reduce the level of risk for client transactions. 

Technology Ecosystem Services 

Order Management Interfaces. Our order management system (OMS), based on the Oracle JD Edwards ERP suite, is a scalable solution built for DTC and business to business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) order processing. We also offer a distributed order management solution utilizing the Shopatron Retailer software that is tightly integrated with our internal OMS. This solution provides retailers with a complete technology solution for integrating both online and offline channels. &#160; Our order management technology solutions provide interfaces that allow for real-time information retrieval, including information on inventory, sales orders, shipments, delivery, purchase orders, warehouse receipts, customer history, accounts receivable and credit lines. These solutions are seamlessly integrated with our web-enabled customer contact centers, allowing for the processing of orders through shopping cart, phone, fax, mail, email, web chat, and other order receipt methods. As the information backbone for our total supply chain solution, order management services can be used on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with our other business infrastructure offerings, including customer contact, financial or distribution services. In addition, for the B2B market, our technology platform provides a variety of order receipt methods that facilitate commerce within various stages of the supply chain. Our systems provide the ability for both our clients and their customers to track the status of orders at any time. Our services are transparent to our clients&#8217; customers and are seamlessly integrated with our clients&#8217; internal system platforms and web sites. By synchronizing these activities, we can capture and provide critical customer information, including: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Statistical measurements critical to creating a quality customer experience, containing real-time order status, order exceptions, back order tracking, allocation of product based on timing of online purchase and business rules, the ratio of customer inquiries to purchases, average order sizes and order response time; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

B2B supply chain management information critical to evaluating inventory positioning, for the purpose of improving inventory turns, and assessing product flow-through and end-user demand; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Reverse logistics information, including customer response and reason for the return or rotation of product and desired customer action; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Detailed marketing information about what was sold and to whom it was sold, by location and preference; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Web traffic reporting showing the number of visits (&#8220;hits&#8221;) received, areas visited, and products and information requested. 

Product Content Management. PFSweb's iCommerce PCM solution provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, integrating, mastering, and syndicating product content efficiently across an entire organization. Leveraging enterprise-class product information management (PIM) software powered by Riversand Technologies, we provide a solution that enables brands to maximize the selling value of their product content across all commerce channels. 

Technology Collaboration. We have created a suite of technology services that enable buyers and suppliers to fully automate their business transactions within their supply chain using the order management interfaces. Our collaboration technologies operate in an open systems environment and feature the use of industry-standard XML and SOA web services, enabling customized eCommerce solutions with minimal changes to a client&#8217;s systems or our Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) systems. The result is a faster implementation process. We also support information exchange methods such as AS2, SFTP, EDI, MQ Series, ALE, and REST/SOAP over HTTPS. 

Information Management. We have the ability to communicate with and transfer information to and from our clients through a wide variety of technology services, including real-time web service enabled data interfaces, file transfer methods and electronic data interchange. Our systems are designed to capture, store and electronically forward to our clients critical information regarding customer inquiries and orders, product shipments, inventory status (for example, levels of inventory on hand, on backorder, on purchase order and inventory due dates to our warehouse), product returns and other information. Our systems are capable of providing our clients with customer inventory and order information for use in analyzing sales and marketing trends and introducing new products. We also offer customized reports and data analyses based upon specific client needs to assist them in their budgeting and business decision process. We are managing this information while securing data and complying with various privacy regulations. 

&#160;

SELLER SERV ICES FINANCIAL MODELS 

Service Fee Model 

We refer to the standard PFS seller services financial model as the &#8220;Service Fee&#8221; model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various business outsourcing services in support of their business operations. We provide ecommerce website services, inventory and order management, customer service, payment processing, and operations reports such as product sales, sales tax, and inventory management reports. In this model, we provide infrastructure and services and the clients are responsible for all financial operations and reporting related to the sales transactions. 

The Service Fee model is designed to generate margins for our clients consistent with other retailers in our clients&#8217; product category and provide bottom line financial results for our clients similar to other retailers in their space. We report service fee revenues from clients in this model in our traditional PFSweb service fee segment. 

Agent (Flash) Financial Model 

As an additional service, we offer an &#8220;Agent&#8221;, or &#8220;Flash&#8221; model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a &#8220;flash&#8221; sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The &#8220;flash&#8221; ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. 

Retail Financial Model 

In addition to the Service Fee and the Agent models, we also offer a &#8220;Retail&#8221; model. Under the Retail model, a PFSweb subsidiary purchases inventory from the client. In the Retail model, we place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product upon delivery to our facility. 

Because we are the product owner as well as the merchant of record, we work closely with the client to plan sales and promotional activities. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile as well as potential reimbursement for uncollectible customer accounts receivable balances. Since we purchase and own the inventory and accounts receivable, this business model may require significant working capital requirements for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record either: 1) gross revenue - product revenue or 2) net revenue - product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.

The costs of all standard PFSweb services normally billed on a transaction basis under the Service Fee model, as well as certain credit risks, may be covered by the selling margin under the Retail model arrangement. The bottom line financial results for our client should be similar to the financial benefits from the retail channel, although unlike the traditional retail channel, our clients generally control the presentation and branding of the web site and own all the customer data from the eCommerce activities. 

In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach, although we have one client still operating under the gross revenue approach. We use our Retail model to enable our Supplies Distributors subsidiary to serve as a global distributor of printer supplies for Ricoh Infoprint Solutions Company (&#8220;IPS&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ricoh Company Ltd. (&#8220;Ricoh&#8221;). In this model, the product revenues are reported in our Business and Retail Connect segment. 

&#160;

INDUSTRY INFORMATION AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Industry Overview 

Business activities in the public and private sectors continue to operate in an environment of rapid technological advancement, increasing competition and continuous pressure to improve operating and supply chain efficiency while decreasing costs. We currently see the following trends within the industry: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Manufacturers strive to restructure their supply chains to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in both B2B and DTC markets, and to create a variable-cost supply chain able to support the multiple, unique needs of each of their initiatives, including traditional and electronic commerce. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Companies in a variety of industries seek outsourcing as a method to address one or more business functions that are not within their core business competencies, to reduce operating costs or to improve the speed or cost of implementation. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Retailers, both traditional and e-commerce only, partner with end to end providers to provide a turnkey solution to support their e-commerce channels. Providers with a global presence provide additional value to companies pursuing an international expansion strategy.

Supply Chain Management Trend 

As companies maintain focus on improving their businesses and balance sheet financial ratios, significant efforts and investments continue to be made identifying ways to maximize supply chain efficiency and extend supply chain processes. Working capital financing, vendor managed inventory, supply chain visibility software solutions, distribution channel skipping, direct to consumer eCommerce sales initiatives, and complex upstream supply chain collaborative technology are products that manufacturers seek to help them achieve greater supply chain efficiency. 

A key business challenge facing many manufacturers and retailers as they evaluate their supply chain efficiency is in determining how the trend toward increased DTC business activity will impact their traditional B2B and DTC commerce business models. Order management and small package fulfillment and distribution capabilities are becoming increasingly important processes as this trend evolves. We believe manufacturers will look to outsource their non-core competency functions to support this modified business model. We believe companies will continue to strategically plan for the impact that eCommerce and other new technology advancements will have on their traditional commerce business models and their existing technology and infrastructure capabilities. Additionally, B2B opportunities exist as companies look to leverage the technology and enhanced customer experience that currently exists within eCommerce channels.

Manufacturers, as buyers of materials, are also imposing new business practices and policies on their supplier partners to shift the normal supply chain costs and risks associated with inventory ownership away from their own balance sheets. Through techniques like Vendor Managed Inventory or Consigned Inventory Programs (&#8220;CIP&#8221;), manufacturers are asking their suppliers, as a part of the supplier selection process, to provide capabilities where the manufacturer need not own, or even possess, inventory prior to the exact moment that unit of inventory is required as a raw material component or for shipping to a customer. To be successful for all parties, business models such as these often require a sophisticated collection of technological capabilities that allow for complete integration and collaboration of the information technology environments of both the buyer and supplier. For example, for an inventory unit to arrive at the precise required moment in the manufacturing facility, it is necessary for the Manufacturing Resource Planning systems of the manufacturer to integrate with the CRM systems of the supplier. When hundreds of supplier partners are involved, this process can become quite complex and technologically challenging. Buyers and suppliers are seeking solutions that utilize XML based protocols and traditional EDI standards to ensure an open systems platform that promote easier technology integration in these collaborative solutions. 

Outsourcing Trend 

In response to growing competitive pressures and technological innovations, we believe many companies, both large and small, are focusing their critical resources on the core competencies of their business and utilizing eCommerce service providers to accelerate their business plans in a cost-effective manner and perform non-core business functions. Outsourcing can provide many key benefits, including the ability to: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Enter new business markets or geographic areas rapidly; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Increase flexibility to meet changing business conditions and demand for products and services; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Enhance customer satisfaction and gain competitive advantage; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Reduce capital and personnel investments and convert fixed investments to variable costs; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Improve operating performance and efficiency; and &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Capitalize on skills, expertise and technology infrastructure that would otherwise be unavailable or expensive given the scale of the business. 

Typically, many outsourcing service providers are focused on a single function, such as information technology, call center management, credit card processing, warehousing or package delivery. This focus creates several challenges for companies looking to outsource more than one of these functions, including the need to manage multiple outsourcing service providers, to share information with service providers and to integrate that information into their internal systems. Additionally, the delivery of these multiple services must be transparent to the customer and enable the client to maintain brand recognition and customer loyalty. Furthermore, traditional commerce outsourcers are frequently providers of domestic-only services versus international solutions. As a result, companies requiring global solutions must establish additional relationships with other outsourcing parties. 

Another vital point for major brand name companies seeking to outsource is the protection of their brand. When looking for an outsourcing partner to provide infrastructure solutions, brand name companies must find a company that can provide the same quality performance and superior experience their customers expect from their brands. Working with an outsourcing partner requires finding a partner that can maintain the consistency of their brand image, which is one of the most valuable intangible assets that recognized brand name companies possess. 

Competition 

We face competition from many different sources depending upon the type and range of services requested by a potential client. Many other companies offer one or more of the same services we provide on an individual basis. Our competitors include vertical outsourcers, which are companies that offer a single function solution. We compete with transportation logistics providers, known in the industry as 3PL&#8217;s and 4PL&#8217;s (third or fourth party logistics providers), who offer product management functions as an ancillary service to their primary transportation services. We also compete against other Global Commerce Service Providers, who perform various services similar to our solution offerings. Additionally, we see competition from digital agencies providing creative, commerce strategy and system integration services.

In many instances, we compete with the in-house operations of our potential clients themselves. Occasionally, the operations departments of potential clients believe they can perform the same services we do, at similar quality levels and costs, while others are reluctant to outsource business functions that involve direct customer contact. We cannot be certain we will be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors in the future. 

Although many of our competitors offer one or more of our services, we believe our primary competitive advantage is our ability to offer a full array of customized services marketed as PFSweb&#8217;s End2End eCommerce &#174; solutions, thereby eliminating any need for our clients to coordinate these services from many different providers. We believe we can differentiate ourselves by offering our clients a very broad range of eCommerce and business process services that address, in many cases, the entire value chain, from demand to delivery. 

We also compete on the basis of many other important additional factors, including: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

experience supporting a specific product vertically;

&#160;

&#9679; 

operating performance and reliability; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

ease of implementation and integration; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

experience of the people required to successfully and efficiently design and implement solutions; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

experience operating similar solutions dynamically; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

leading edge technology capabilities; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

global reach; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

price. 

We believe we can compete favorably with respect to many of these factors. However, the market for our services is competitive and continually evolving, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. 

&#160;

COMPANY INFORMATION 

Clients and Marketing 

Our target clients include traditional retailers, online retailers and leading technology and consumer goods brands looking to quickly and efficiently implement or enhance business initiatives, adapt their go-to-market strategies, or introduce new products, programs or geographies, without the burden of modifying or expanding their technology, customer care, supply chain and logistics infrastructure. Our solutions are applicable to a multitude of industries and company types and we have provided solutions for such companies as: 

Procter &#38; Gamble (consumer packaged goods), L&#8217;Or&#233;al (health &#38; beauty), LEGO Brand Retail (toys), T.J. Maxx (apparel and home fashion), Columbia Sportswear (active outdoor apparel), Diageo (premium beverages), Roots Canada Ltd. (apparel), BCBGMAXAZRIA (high fashion), Ricoh (printer supplies), Xerox (printers and printer supplies) and Pandora (jewelry) among many others. During 2015, one service fee client relationship, the United States Mint, represented more than 10% of our consolidated total net revenues.

We target potential clients through an extensive integrated marketing program comprised of a variety of direct marketing techniques, email marketing initiatives, trade event participation, search engine marketing, public relations, social media and a sophisticated outbound tele-sales lead generation model. We have also developed global business development methodology which allows us to effectively showcase our various eCommerce service solutions and products. We also pursue strategic marketing alliances with consulting firms, software manufacturers and other logistics providers to increase market awareness and generate referrals and customer leads. 

Because of the highly complex nature of the solutions we provide, our clients demand significant competence and experience from a variety of different business disciplines during the sales cycle. As such, we often utilize a member of our executive team to lead the design and proposal development of each potential new client we choose to pursue. The executive is supported by a select group of highly experienced individuals from our professional services group with specific industry knowledge of, or experience with, the solutions development process. We employ a team of highly trained implementation managers whose responsibilities include the oversight and supervision of client projects and maintaining high levels of client satisfaction during the transition process between the various stages of the sales cycle and steady state operations. 

Technology 

We maintain advanced management information systems and have automated key business functions using online, real-time or batch systems. These systems enable us to provide information concerning sales, inventory status, customer payments and other operations essential for us and our clients to efficiently manage electronic commerce and supply chain business programs. Our systems are designed to scale rapidly to handle the transaction processing demands of our clients and our growth. 

&#160;

Many internal infrastructures are not sufficient to support the explosive growth in e-business, e-marketplaces, supply chain compression, distribution channel realignment and the corresponding demand for real-time information necessary for strategic decision-making and product fulfillment. To address this need, we have created PFSweb&#8217;s End2End eCommerce &#174; platform to enable companies with little or no eCommerce infrastructure to speed their time to market and minimize resource investment and risk, and to allow all compani es involved to improve the efficiency of their supply chain. 

Using the various components of our collaboration technology suite, we can assist our clients in easily integrating their web sites or ERP systems to our systems for real-time web service enabled transaction processing without regard for their hardware platform or operating system. This high-level of systems integration allows our clients to automatically process orders, customer data and other eCommerce information. We also can track information sent to us by the client as it moves through our systems in the same manner a carrier would track a package throughout the delivery process. Our systems enable us to track, at a detailed level, information received, transmission timing, any errors or special processing required and information sent back to the client. 

We have invested in advanced telecommunications, computer telephony, electronic mail and messaging, automated fax technology, IVR technology, barcode scanning, wireless technology, fiber optic network communications and automated inventory management systems. We have also developed and utilize telecommunications technology that provides for automatic customer call recognition and customer profile recall for inbound customer service representatives. 

The primary responsibility of our systems development team of IT professionals is directed at implementing custom solutions for new clients and maintaining existing client relationships. Our development team can also produce proprietary systems infrastructure to expand our capabilities in circumstances where we cannot purchase standard solutions from commercial providers. We also utilize temporary and/or contract resources when needed for additional capacity. 

Our information technology operations and infrastructure are built on the premise of reliability and scalability. We maintain diesel generators and un-interruptible power supply equipment to provide constant availability to computer rooms, call centers and warehouses. Multiple internet service providers and redundant web servers provide for a high degree of availability to web sites that interface with our systems. Capacity planning and upgrading is performed regularly to allow for quick implementation of new clients and avoid time-consuming infrastructure upgrades that could slow growth rates. In the event of a disastrous situation, we also have a disaster recovery plan that provides geographically separated and comparably equipped data centers that are able to recover stored data in a reasonable and effective manner. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 2,100 employees, of which approximately 1,450 were located in the United States. We have never suffered an interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In the U.S., Canada and India, we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and while our European subsidiaries are not a party to a collective-bargaining agreement, they are required to comply with certain rules agreed upon by their employee Works Councils. 

Our success in recruiting, hiring and training large numbers of skilled employees and obtaining large numbers of hourly employees and temporary staff during peak periods for distribution and call center operations is critical to our ability to provide high quality distribution and support services. Call center representatives and distribution personnel receive feedback on their performance on a regular basis and, as appropriate, are recognized for superior performance or given additional training. Generally, our clients provide specific product training for our customer service representatives and, in certain instances, on-site client personnel to provide specific technical support. To maintain good employee relations and to minimize employee turnover, we strive to offer competitive pay, hire primarily full-time employees who are eligible to receive a full range of employee benefits, and provide employees with clear, visible career paths. 

Internet Access to Reports 

We maintain an Internet website, www.pfsweb.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K (and amendments, if any, to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are made available, free of charge, through the investor relations section of this website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on this website is not incorporated in this report. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of our customers&#8217; personally identifiable information and other non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Furthermore, the growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens and greater penalties on online companies. Moreover, there is a trend toward regulations requiring companies to provide consumers with greater information regarding, and greater control over, how their personal data is used, and requiring notification when unauthorized access to such data occurs. For example, many states currently require us to notify each of our customers who are affected by any data security breach in which an unauthorized person, such as a computer hacker, obtains such customer&#8217;s name and one or more of the customer&#8217;s social security number, driver&#8217;s license number, credit or debit card number or other similar personal information. In addition, several jurisdictions, including foreign countries, have adopted privacy-related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email promotions, commonly known as &#8220;spam,&#8221; and that impose significant monetary and other penalties for violations. One such law, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and the recent anti-spam legislation passed in Canada impose complex, burdensome and often ambiguous requirements in connection with our sending commercial email to our customers and potential customers. 

In an effort to comply with these laws, Internet service providers may increasingly block legitimate marketing emails. These consumer protection laws may become more stringent in the future and could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business. Also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. In Europe, a n ew data protection regulation will likely come into effect in 2018 and will supersede Directive 95/46/EC, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. The new regulation will enhance the security and privacy obligations of entities that process data of residents of members of the European Economic Area and substantially increase penalties for violations. In addition, the European Court of Justice has invalidated a decision of the European Commission that permitted our European affiliates and our European customers to transfer personal data to us and other entities in the United States that are certified under the EU-US safe harbor framework. This decision, a failure of the European Union and the United States to implement a new safe-harbor framework, and new regulations and laws in other countries that restrict the export of personal data may require us to increase our IT infrastructure, maintenance and support costs.
