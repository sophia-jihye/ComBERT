 ITEM 1 &#8212; BUSINESS &#160; 

ORGANIZATION 

The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (&#8220;THG&#8221;) is a holding company organized as a Delaware corporation in 1995. We trace our roots to as early as 1852, when the Hanover Fire Insurance Company was founded. Our primary business operations are property and casualty insurance products and services. We market our domestic products and services through independent agents and brokers in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and conduct business internationally through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Chaucer Holdings Limited (&#8220;Chaucer&#8221;), which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd&#8217;s (&#8220;Lloyd&#8217;s&#8221;) and is domiciled in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of THG; The Hanover Insurance Company (&#8220;Hanover Insurance&#8221;) and Citizens Insurance Company of America (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), which are our principal U.S. domiciled property and casualty subsidiaries; Chaucer; and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Our results of operations also include the results of our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former life insurance and accident and health businesses. 

INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING SEGMENTS 

We conduct our business operations through four operating segments. These segments are Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Chaucer and Other. We report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. 

Information with respect to each of our segments is included in &#8220;Results of Operations - Segments&#8221; in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 4 &#8211; &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 

Information with respect to geographic concentrations is included in the &#8220;Description of Business by Segment&#8221; in Part 1 &#8211; Item 1 and in Note 1 4 &#8211; &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. &#160; 

Following is a discussion of our operating segments. 

GENERAL 

In our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments, we underwrite commercial and personal property and casualty insurance through Hanover Insurance, Citizens and other THG subsidiaries, through an independent agent and broker network concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest and Southeast U.S. We also continue to actively grow our Commercial Lines&#8217; presence in the Western region of the U.S., particularly in California, which now is our third largest state for Commercial Lines as measured by net premiums written. Our Chaucer segment is a specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through Lloyd&#8217;s and writes business globally. Included in our Other segment are Opus Investment Management, Inc. (&#8220;Opus&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of THG, which provides investment management services to our insurance and non-insurance companies, as well as to unaffiliated institutions, pension funds and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; and a discontinued voluntary pools business. 

Our business strategy focuses on providing our agents and customers stability, financial strength, and competitive insurance products while prudently growing and diversifying our product and geographical business mix. We conduct our U.S. business with an emphasis on agency relationships and active agency management, disciplined underwriting, pricing, quality claim handling, and customer service. Our Lloyd&#8217;s business is focused on disciplined and specialized underwriting in selected markets. Annually, we write over $5 billion in gross premiums, including approximately $4 billion domestically. Based on net U.S. premiums written, we rank among the top 25 property and casualty insurers in the United States. 

&#160;

RISKS 

The industry&#8217;s profitability and cash flow can be, and historically has been, significantly affected by numerous factors, including price; competition; volatile and unpredictable developments such as extreme weather conditions, catastrophes and other disasters; legal and regulatory developments affecting pricing, underwriting, policy coverage and other aspects of doing business, as well as insurer and insureds&#8217; liability; extra-contractual liability; size of jury awards; acts of terrorism; fluctuations in interest and currency rates or the value of investments; and other general economic conditions and trends, such as inflationary pressure or unemployment, that may affect the adequacy of reserves or the demand for insurance products. Our investment portfolio and its future returns may be further impacted by the capital markets and current economic conditions, which could affect our liquidity, the amount of realized losses and impairments that will be recognized, credit default levels, our ability to hold such investments until recovery and other factors. Additionally, the economic conditions in geographic locations where we conduct business, especially those locations where our business is concentrated, may affect the growth and profitability of our business. The regulatory environments in those locations, including any pricing, underwriting or product controls, shared market mechanisms or mandatory pooling arrangements, and other conditions, such as our agency relationships, affect the growth and profitability of our business. Our loss and loss adjustment expense (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) reserves are based on estimates, principally involving case assessments and actuarial projections, at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known, predictions of future events, estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity and judicial theories of liability, costs of repairs and replacement, legislative activity and other factors. We regularly reassess our estimate of loss reserves and LAE, both for current and past years, and resulting changes have and will affect our reported profitability and financial position. 

Reference is also made to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part 1 &#8211; Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Our Commercial Lines product suite provides agents and customers with products designed for small, middle and specialized markets. 

Commercial Lines coverages include: 

Commercial multiple peril coverage insures businesses against third party general liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold. It also insures business property for damage, such as that caused by fire, wind, hail, water damage (which may include flood), theft and vandalism. 

Commercial automobile coverage insures businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured&#8217;s vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and property. Commercial automobile policies are often written in conjunction with other commercial policies. 

Workers&#8217; compensation coverage insures employers against employee medical and indemnity claims resulting from injuries related to work. Workers&#8217; compensation policies are often written in conjunction with other commercial policies. 

&#160;

Other commercial lines is comprised of: 

&#183; 

inland marine coverage insures businesses against physical losses to property, such as contractor&#8217;s equipment, builders&#8217; risk and goods in transit, and also covers jewelers block, fine art and other valuables; 

&#183; 

AIX program business provides coverage to under-served markets where there are specialty coverage or risk management needs, including commercial multiple peril, workers&#8217; compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and other commercial coverages; 

&#183; 

management and professional liability coverage provides protection for directors and officers of companies that may be sued in connection with their performance, and errors and omissions protection to companies and individuals against negligence or bad faith, as well as protection for employment practices liability and fidelity and crime; 

&#183; 

surety provides businesses with contract surety coverage in the event of performance or non-payment claims, and commercial surety coverage related to fiduciary or regulatory obligations; 

&#183; 

specialty property provides insurance to small and medium-sized chemical, paint, solvent and other manufacturing and distribution companies; and &#160; 

&#183; 

other commercial lines coverages include monoline general liability, umbrella, healthcare and miscellaneous commercial property. Our healthcare coverage includes product liability, medical professional liability and general liability coverages provided to selected portions of the healthcare industry including eldercare providers, durable medical equipment suppliers, podiatrists and behavioral health specialists. 

Our strategy in Commercial Lines focuses on building deep relationships with partner agents through differentiated product offerings, industry segmentation, and franchise value through limited distribution. We continue to make enhancements to our products and technology platforms that are intended to drive more total account placements in our small commercial and middle market business, while delivering enhanced margins in our specialty businesses. This aligns with our focus of delivering the capabilities that will help broaden the depth and breadth of our partnerships with a limited number of agents. 

Our small commercial, middle market and specialty businesses each constitute approximately one-third of our total Commercial Lines business. Small commercial offerings, which generally include premiums of $50,000 or less, deliver value through product expertise, local presence, and ease of doing business. Middle market accounts require greater claim and underwriting expertise, as well as a focus on industry segments where we can deliver differentiation in the market and value to agents and customers. Small and middle market accounts comprise approximately $1.5 billion of the Commercial Lines segment. Our specialty lines of business generally include inland marine, &#160; program business, management and professional liability, surety and specialty property. 

In our small commercial and middle market businesses, we offer coverages and capabilities in several key industries including technology, schools, and human services organizations, such as non-profit youth and community service organizations. We also provide segmentation to our core middle market commercial products, including real estate, hospitality, manufacturing, contractors and wholesale distributors. 

Part of our strategy is to expand our specialty lines offerings in order to provide our agents and policyholders with a broader product portfolio and to increase our market penetration. As part of our strategy, we have over time acquired various specialized businesses aimed at further diversifying and growing our specialty lines. We used these acquisitions as platforms to expand our product offerings and grow through our existing agency and broker distribution network. 

We believe our small commercial capabilities, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty business provides us with a more diversified portfolio of products and enables us to deliver significant value to our agents and policyholders. We believe these efforts will enable us to continue to improve the overall mix of our business and ultimately our underwriting profitability. 

&#160;

Personal Lines 

Our Personal Lines segment generated $ 1.5 billion, or 30. 1 %, of consolidated operating revenues and $1.4 billion, or 31. 3 %, of net premiums written, for the year ended December 31, 201 5 . &#160;

Personal Lines coverages include: 

Personal automobile coverage insures individuals against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured&#8217;s vehicle, and property damage to other vehicles and other property. 

Homeowners coverage insures individuals for losses to their residences and personal property, such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water damage (excluding flood), theft and vandalism, and against third party liability claims. 

Other personal lines are comprised of personal inland marine (jewelry, art, etc.), umbrella, fire, personal watercraft, earthquake and other miscellaneous coverages. 

Our strategy in Personal Lines is to build account&#8211;oriented business through our partner agencies, with a focus on greater geographic diversification. The market for our Personal Lines business continues to be very competitive, with continued pressure on independent agents from direct writers, as well as from the increased usage of real time comparative rating tools and increasingly sophisticated rating and pricing tools. We maintain a focus on partnering with high quality, value added agencies that stress the importance of consultative selling and account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages). We are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability, build a distinctive position in the market, and provide us with profitable growth opportunities. We continue to refine our products and to work closely with these high potential agents to increase the percentage of business they place with us and to ensure that it is consistent with our preferred mix of business. Additionally, we remain focused on further diversifying our state mix beyond the largest historical core states of Michigan, Massachusetts and New York. We expect these efforts to decrease our risk concentrations and our dependency on these three states, as well as to contribute to improved profitability over time. 

Chaucer 

Our Chaucer segment generated $1.1 billion, or 2 2.0 %, of consolidated operating revenues and $ 889.3 &#160; m illion, or 19.3 %, of n et premiums written, for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Chaucer segment is comprised of international business written through Lloyd&#8217;s, and includes: 

Marine and aviation includes worldwide direct, facultative and treaty business. The marine account provides cover for hull, liability, war, terrorism, aviation war, cargo, political risk, specie, fine art and ports and terminals. The aviation account insures airline hull and liability, general aviation, refuellers, aviation products, and satellite. 

Property includes treaty business, as well as direct and facultative coverage for commercial and industrial risks against physical damage and business interruption. The treaty account covers cedants on a global basis, predominantly on an &#8220;excess of loss&#8221; basis for both per risk and catastrophe coverage, with a limited amount of proportional treaty and reinsurance assumed business. 

&#160;

Energy encompasses exploration and production, construction, downstream, operational power and renewables, insuring against physical damage, business interruption, control of well, seepage and pollution and liabilities. Energy also includes a nuclear account, which provides coverage across the nuclear fuel cycle from raw uranium and nuclear fuel to the shipment and storage of waste, with the majority of the exposure relating to power generation at nuclear power stations. In addition to providing coverage for physical damage to civil nuclear power stations, nuclear also provides limited liability coverage. 

U. K. motor provided primary insurance coverage to U.K. motor policyholders. Effective June 30, 2015, the U.K. motor business was transferred to an unaffiliated U.K.-based insurance provider. The net premiums written include the transfer of $137.4 million of unearned premium reserves previously written by the U.K. motor business. See &#8220;Disposal of U.K. Motor Business&#8221; in Note 2 &#8211; &#8220;Dispositions of Businesses&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Previously, Chaucer wrote personal automobile, commercial and fleet polices, as well as specialist classes, including motorcycles, motor trade, and classic and specialist vehicles. 

Casualty and other provides liability coverage internationally, including our expanded U.S. casualty business, for professional and commercial risks on a direct and treaty basis, credit and bond, crime and professional liability coverage for financial institutions, medical malpractice and excess workers&#8217; compensation. Other lines also encompass liabilities arising from previous participations on risks insured by third party Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates, which provided liability coverage to financial institutions. 

Chaucer is a specialist insurance underwriting group that participates in the Lloyd&#8217;s market through the provision of capital to support the underwriting activities of syndicates at Lloyd&#8217;s and the ownership of Chaucer Syndicates Limited (&#8220;CSL&#8221;), a managing agent. CSL manages two syndicates currently underwriting at Lloyd&#8217;s, for which we provide capital to support their underwriting activities. 

Chaucer provides capital to Syndicate 1084, which underwrites a range of property, marine, aviation, casualty and energy products for commercial clients worldwide; and Syndicate 1176, which primarily provides protection against physical damage and limited liability exposures from power generation at nuclear power stations. The energy line of business includes $20.0 million of net premiums written from Syndicate 1176. 

Our econom ic interests in Syndicates 1084 and 1176 were 100% and 57%, respectively, &#160; in &#160; both the 2015 and 2014 underwriting years. 

Chaucer has broad underwriting expertise to support its diversified underwriting portfolio that, we believe, provides many benefits, including capital diversification, volatility management and long-term protection of our underwriting capabilities. We actively manage our portfolio, transferring underwriting capital to increase premium volumes during periods of increased rates, while remaining selective or reducing our capital and premium volumes in those lines where rates are under pressure. 

Overall, we believe that the strength and depth of our underwriting teams, together with the broad diversity of our underwriting portfolio and our membership in the Lloyd&#8217;s market, underpin our ability to manage both the scale and composition of our business. Moreover, these strengths, combined with our continued active management of our portfolio and the underwriting opportunities available, provide a sound basis for the profitable development of the Chaucer business. 

Other 

The Other segment consists of: Opus, which provides investment advisory services to affiliates and also manages approximately $ 1.4 billion of assets for unaffiliated institutions such as insurance companies, retirement plans and foundations; earnings on holding company assets; and our discontinued voluntary pools business. 

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

We serve a variety of standard, specialty and targeted industry markets. Consistent with our objective to diversify our underwriting risks on a geographic and line of business basis, we currently have a split of approximately one-third each of domestic standard Commercial Lines, international and domestic specialty lines, and domestic standard Personal Lines. Our Commercial and Personal Lines segments, comprising our principal domestic U.S. subsidiaries, distribute our products primarily through an independent agent network. Our Chaucer segment, comprising our international business, distributes primarily through insurance brokers in the Lloyd&#8217;s market. 

&#160;

Commercial and Personal Lines 

Our Commercial and Personal Lines agency distribution strategy and field structure are designed to maintain a strong focus on local markets and the flexibility to respond to specific market conditions. During 2015, we wrote 20 % of our Commercial and Personal Lines business in Michigan and 10 % in Massachusetts. Our structure is a key factor in the establishment and maintenance of productive, long-term relationships with mid-sized, well-established independent agencies. We maintain 40 local offices across 29 states. The majority of processing support for these locations is provided from Worcester, Massachusetts; Howell, Michigan; Salem, Virginia; and Windsor, Connecticut. 

Independent agents account for substantially all of the sales of our Commercial and Personal Lines property and casualty products. Agencies are appointed based on profitability, track record, financial stability, professionalism, and business strategy. Once appointed, we monitor their performance and, subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may take actions as necessary to change these business relationships, such as discontinuing the authority of the agent to underwrite certain products or revising commissions or bonus opportunities. We compensate agents primarily through base commissions and bonus plans that are tied to an agency&#8217;s written premium, growth and profitability. 

We are licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in all fifty states in the U.S., as well as in the District of Columbia. We actively market Commercial Lines policies throughout the U.S. in 37 states and Personal Lines policies in 17 sta tes. &#160;

We manage our Commercial Lines portfolio, which includes our core and specialty businesses, with a focus on growth from the most profitable industry segments within our underwriting expertise. Our core business is generally comprised of several coordinated commercial lines of business, including small and middle market accounts, which include targeted industry segments. Such business is split between small accounts, generally having less than $50,000 in premium, and middle market accounts, those with premium over $50,000, with most middle market accounts having less than $250,000 of premium. Additionally, we have multiple specialty lines of business, which include inland marine, program business, management and professional liability, surety and specialty property. The Commercial Lines segment seeks to maintain strong agency relationships as a strategy to secure and retain our agents&#8217; best business. We monitor quality of business written through ongoing quality review efforts, accountability for which is shared at the local, regional and corporate levels. 

We manage Personal Lines business with a focus on acquiring and retaining quality accounts. Currently, approximately 80% of our policies in force are account business. Approximately 56% of our Personal Lines net premium written is generated in the combined states of Michigan and Massachusetts. In Michigan, based upon direct premiums written for 2015, we underwrite approximately 6% of the state&#8217;s total market. 

Approximately 66% of our Michigan Personal Lines business is in the personal automobile line and 33% is in the homeowners line. Michigan business represents approximately 4 5 % of our total personal automobile net premiums written and 40% our total homeowners net premiums written. In Michigan, we are a principal market for many of our appointed agencies , with approximately $1.7 million of total direct premiums written per agency in 201 5 . 

Approximately 70% of our Massachusetts Personal Lines business is in the personal automobile line and 27% is in the homeowners line. Massachusetts business represents approximately 15% of our total personal automobile net premiums written and approximately 10% of our total homeowners net premiums written. &#160; 

We sponsor local and national agent advisory councils to gain the benefit of our agents&#8217; insight and enhance our relationships. These councils provide feedback, input on the development of products and services, guidance on marketing efforts, support for our strategies, and assist us in enhancing our local market presence. 

Chaucer 

Chaucer underwrites open market business primarily from Lloyd&#8217;s brokers and underwriting agencies. We primarily compensate brokers and underwriting agencies through commission payments. &#160; Prior to the transfer of the U.K. motor business, Chaucer also used retail brokers and comparative website aggregators. 

In the Lloyd&#8217;s open market, brokers approach Chaucer with individual insurance and reinsurance risk opportunities for underwriter consideration. Brokers also gain access to Chaucer&#8217;s products through selected underwriting agencies (also referred to as coverholders), to which Chaucer has granted limited authority to make underwriting decisions on individual risks. In general, risks written through underwriting agencies are smaller in terms of both exposure and premium. Risks are placed in Lloyd&#8217;s through a subscription placement process whereby generally several syndicates take a share of a contract rather than one insurer taking 100% on a direct basis. This facilitates the spreading of large and complex risks across a number of insurers, while limiting the underwriting risk of each insurer. 

We have an international network of offices to improve our access to high quality risks worldwide. This is expected to improve the diversification of our underwriting and our ability to manage our portfolio. We have offices in Denmark and Singapore to capitalize upon specific class of business opportunities in these regions. In 2015, our Singapore office developed an underwriting presence in China and Labuan, Malaysia to improve access to business opportunities in the Asia region, and o ur underwriting representation for Latin American business relocated to Miami, Florida from Buenos Aires, Argentina. We also have an office in Oslo, Norway, to provide access to the Norwegian and regional North Sea energy sector.

PRICING AND COMPETITION 

The property and casualty industry is a very competitive market. Our competitors include national, international, regional and local companies that sell insurance through various distribution channels, including independent agencies, captive agency forces, brokers and direct to consumers through the internet or otherwise. They also include mutual insurance companies, reciprocals and exchanges. In the Commercial and Personal Lines segments, we market through independent agents and brokers and compete for business on the basis of product, price, agency and customer service, local relationships, ratings, and effective claims handling, among other things. We believe that our emphasis on maintaining strong agency relationships and a local presence in our markets, coupled with investments in products, operating efficiency, technology and effective claims handling, enable us to compete effectively. Our broad product offerings in Commercial Lines and total account strategy in Personal Lines are instrumental to our strategy to capitalize on these relationships and improve profitability. 

We seek to achieve targeted combined ratios in each of our product lines. Targets vary by product and geography and change with market conditions. The targeted combined ratios reflect competitive market conditions, investment yield expectations, our loss payout patterns, and target returns on equity. This strategy is intended to enable us to achieve measured growth and consistent profitability. 

For all major product lines, we employ pricing teams which produce exposure and experience-based rating models to support underwriting and pricing decisions. In addition, in the Commercial and Personal Lines segments, we seek to utilize our understanding of local markets to achieve superior underwriting results. We rely on market information provided by our local agents and on the knowledge of staff in the local branch offices. Since we maintain a strong regional focus and a significant market share in a number of states, we can better apply our knowledge and experience in making underwriting and rate setting decisions. Also, we seek to gather objective and verifiable information at a policy level during the underwriting process, including prior loss experience, past driving records and, where permitted, credit histories. 

The Commercial and Personal Lines segments are not dependent on a single customer or even a few customers, for which the loss of any one or more would have an adverse effect upon the insurance operations for these segments. 

We market Chaucer product offerings through insurance brokers in the Lloyd&#8217;s specialty market, which provides access to business from clients and coverholders. We are able to attract business through our recognized capability to serve as the lead underwriter in most classes we write, particularly in classes where such lead ability is sought by clients and recognized by following underwriters. This requires significant underwriting and claims handling expertise in very specialized lines of business. Our competitors include large international insurance companies and other Lloyd&#8217;s managing underwriters. Broker relationships that are ten percent or more of total Chaucer 2015 gross premiums written are with Aon Benfield (15%), Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies (14%) and Willis Group (10%) . &#160; 

&#160;

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT 

Claims management includes the receipt of initial loss notifications, generation of appropriate responses to claim reports, loss appraisals, identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required, retention of legal representation where appropriate, establishment of case reserves, approval of loss payments and notification to reinsurers. Part of our strategy focuses on efficient, timely, and fair claim settlements to meet customer service expectations and maintain valuable independent agent relationships. Additionally, effective claims management is important to our business as claim payments and related loss adjustment expenses are our single largest expenditures. 

Commercial and Personal Lines 

We utilize experienced claims adjusters, appraisers, medical specialists, managers and attorneys to manage our claims. Our U.S. property and casualty operations have field claims adjusters located throughout the states and regions in which we do business. Claims field staff members work closely with the independent agents who bound the policies under which coverage is claimed. Claims office adjusting staff is supported by general adjusters for large property and large casualty losses, by automobile and heavy equipment damage appraisers for automobile material damage losses, and by medical specialists whose principal concentration is on workers&#8217; compensation and automobile injury cases. Additionally, the claims offices are supported by staff attorneys, both in the home office and in regional locations, who specialize in litigation defense and claim settlements. We have a catastrophe response team to assist policyholders impacted by severe weather events. This team mobilizes quickly to impacted regions, often in advance for a large tracked storm, to support our local claims adjusters and facilitate a timely response to resulting claims. We also maintain a special unit that investigates suspected insurance fraud and abuse. We utilize claims processing technology which allows most of the smaller and more routine Personal Lines claims to be processed at centralized locations. 

Chaucer 

The Chaucer claims team is responsible for establishing case reserves, loss and LAE cost management, exposure mitigation and litigation management. Chaucer engages third party administrators to handle claims in certain cases and authorizes selected agencies to manage claims under risks which they have bound on Chaucer&#8217;s behalf. 

For claims where Chaucer is the lead syndicate, our appointed claims adjusters establish the case reserves and may appoint attorneys, loss adjusters or other third party experts. For claims where Chaucer is not the lead syndicate, the Lloyd&#8217;s syndicate leading the risk establishes case reserves in conjunction with professional third party adjusters, and then advises all other syndicates participating on the risk of the loss reserve requirements. In such cases, the Chaucer claims team reviews material claims and developments. Prior to the sale of its U.K. motor business on June 30, 2015, Chaucer also engaged automobile body and repair shops who assisted in managing claims. 

CATASTROPHES 

We are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes, which historically have had a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Coverage for such events is a core part of our business and we expect to experience catastrophe losses in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and position. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fire, explosions, and terrorism. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. 

Commercial and Personal Lines 

We endeavor to manage our catastrophe risks through underwriting procedures, including the use of deductibles and specific exclusions for floods and earthquakes, subject to regulatory restrictions and competitive pressures, and through geographic exposure management and reinsurance. The catastrophe reinsurance program is structured to protect us on a per-occurrence basis. We monitor geographic location and coverage concentrations in order to manage corporate exposure to catastrophic events. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, commercial multiple peril and homeowners property coverages have, in the past, generated the majority of catastrophe-related claims. 

Chaucer 

In d ividual commercial and industrial risks within our property, marine and aviation and energy lines include protection against natural or man-made catastrophes worldwide. We accept these risks on direct, facultative, and proportional and excess of loss treaty bases. We seek to manage such risks through limiting the proportion of any individual risk or class of risk we assume and managing geographic concentration, and through the purchase of reinsurance. 

We purchase reinsurance to limit our exposure to individual risks and catastrophic events. This includes facultative reinsurance, to limit the exposure on a specified risk; specific excess and proportional treaty, to limit exposure to individual contracts or risks within specified classes of business; and catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance, to limit exposure to any one event that might affect more than one individual contract. 

&#160;

The level of reinsurance that Chaucer purchases is dependent on a number of factors, including our underwriting risk appetite for catastrophe risk, the specific risks inherent in each line or class of business risk written and the pricing, coverage and terms and conditions available from the reinsurance market. 

TERRORISM 

As a result of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks worldwide, the insurance industry maintains a high level of focus with respect to the potential for losses caused by terrorist acts. These losses may encompass people, property and business operations covered under workers&#8217; compensation, commercial multiple peril and other Commercial Lines policies. In certain cases, we are not able to exclude coverage for these losses, either because of regulatory requirements or competitive pressures. We continually evaluate the potential effect of these low frequency, but potentially high severity events in our overall pricing and underwriting plans, especially for policies written in major metropolitan areas. 

Private sector catastrophe reinsurance is limited and generally unavailable for losses attributed to acts of terrorism, particularly those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and/or radiological events. As a result, the industry&#8217;s primary reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks in the U.S. is provided through a Federal program that provides compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Additionally, certain terrorism-related risks embedded in our Commercial and Personal Lines are covered under the existing Catastrophe, Property per Risk and Casualty Excess of Loss corporate reinsurance treaties (see &#8220;Reinsurance&#8221; for additional information). 

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the &#8220;U.S. Program&#8221;). Coverage under the U.S. Program applies to workers&#8217; compensation, commercial multiple peril and certain other Commercial Lines policies for U.S. direct written policies. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (&#8220;TRIPRA&#8221;) extended the U.S. Program through December 31, 2020. All commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the U.S. participate in the program. Under the program, a participating issuer, in exchange for making terrorism insurance available, may be entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for a portion of its aggregate losses. The U.S. Program does not cover losses in surety, Personal Lines or certain other lines of business. Losses caused by terrorist acts are not excluded from homeowners or personal automobile policies. 

As required by the current U.S. Program, we offer policyholders in specific lines of commercial insurance the option to elect terrorism coverage. In order for a loss to be covered under the U.S. Program, the loss must meet aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an act of terrorism as certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney General. Losses from acts which do not qualify or are not so certified will not receive the benefit of the U.S. Program and in fact, may be deemed covered losses whether or not terrorism coverage was purchased. The current U.S. Program requires insurance carriers to retain 16% of any claims from a certified terrorist event in excess of the federally mandated deductible in 2016 subject to an annual industry-wide cap of $100 billion . This retention will increase, by 1% each calendar year until it reaches 20% in 2020. The federally mandated deductible represents 20% of direct earned premium for the covered lines of business of the prior year. In 2015, our deductible was $35 6 million, which represents 17.3% o f year-end 2014 statutory policyholder surplus of our U.S. domestic insurers, and is estimated to be $381 million in 2016, representing 17. 4 % of 2015 year-end statutory policyholder surplus. 

Given the unpredictability of terrorism losses, future losses from acts of terrorism could be material to our operating results, financial position, and/or liquidity. We attempt to manage our exposures on an individual line of business basis and in the aggregate by one-half square mile grids. 

Chaucer&#8217;s direct written U.S. policies are also covered under the provisions of TRIPRA. Generally, terrorism coverage is excluded from the commercial property classes and coverages that Chaucer writes, including in its world-wide nuclear energy business, although a limited portion of Chaucer&#8217;s property and political risk business outside of the U.S. provides terrorism coverage. We manage this exposure through policy limits, monitoring of risk aggregation and reinsurance. For Chaucer&#8217;s nuclear energy business, most of our liability coverage includes losses resulting from acts of terrorism, although Chaucer normally ensures that the net liability involved does not exceed 50% of the full exposure, whether property, liability or combined. 

REGULATION 

Commercial and Personal Lines 

Our U.S. property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the various states in which they transact business and are supervised by the individual state insurance departments. Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, including premium rates, mandatory covered risks, limitations on the ability to non-renew or reject business, prohibited exclusions, licensing and appointment of agents, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investments and capital, policy forms and coverages, advertising, and other conduct, including restrictions on the use of credit information and other factors in underwriting, as well as other underwriting and claims practices. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. 

&#160;

Such laws, rules and regulations are usually overseen and enforced by the various state insurance departments, as well as through private rights of action and increasingly, by state attorneys general. Such regulations or enforcement actions are often responsive to current consumer and political sensitivities such as automobile and homeowners insurance rates and coverage forms, or which may arise after a major event. Such rules and regulations may result in rate suppression, limit our ability to manage our exposure to unprofitable or volatile risks, or lead to fines, premium refunds or other adverse consequences. The federal government also may regulate aspects of our businesses such as the use of insurance (credit) scores in underwriting and the protection of confidential information. 

In addition, as a condition to writing business in certain states, insurers are required to participate in various pools or risk sharing mechanisms or to accept certain classes of risk, regardless of whether such risks meet its underwriting requirements for voluntary business. Some states also limit or impose restrictions on the ability of an insurer to withdraw from certain classes of business. For example, Massachusetts, New York, and California each impose material restrictions on a company&#8217;s ability to materially reduce its exposures or to withdraw from certain lines of business in their respective states. The state insurance departments can impose significant charges on an insurer in connection with a market withdrawal or refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal of policies or that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may significantly restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. 

Over the past several years, other state-sponsored insurers, reinsurers or involuntary pools have increased, particularly in those states which have Atlantic or Gulf Coast storm exposures. As a result, the potential assessment exposure of insurers doing business in such states and the attendant collection risks have increased. Such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure to hurricane-related losses. 

The insurance laws of many states subject property and casualty insurers doing business in those states to statutory property and casualty guaranty fund assessments. The purpose of a guaranty fund is to protect policyholders by requiring that solvent property and casualty insurers pay insurance claims of insolvent insurers. These guaranty associations generally pay these claims by assessing solvent insurers proportionately based on the insurer&#8217;s share of voluntary premiums written in the state. While most guaranty associations provide for recovery of assessments through subsequent rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits, there is no assurance that insurers will ultimately recover these assessments, which could be material, particularly following a large catastrophe or in markets which become disrupted. 

We are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations conducted by state insurance departments. We are also required to file annual and other reports with state insurance departments relating to the financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries and other matters. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) and the Federal Insurance Office are each actively engaged in reviewing and considering proposed insurer risk-based capital standards, risk analysis, solvency assessments and other regulatory initiatives. 

Chaucer 

Chaucer is regulated by both the Prudential Regulation Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) and the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), who together have responsibility for the U.K. financial services industry, including insurers, insurance intermediaries and Lloyd&#8217;s. The PRA is responsible for the prudential supervision of, among other financial institutions, Lloyd&#8217;s insurers, with a particular focus on financial stability. The FCA focuses on conduct of business issues, with a particular focus on consumer protection and market integrity. In addition, Chaucer is supervised by the Council of Lloyd&#8217;s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd&#8217;s operations. 

The PRA, FCA and Council of Lloyd&#8217;s have common objectives in ensuring the appropriate regulation of the Lloyd&#8217;s market and, to minimize duplication, the PRA and FCA have arrangements with Lloyd&#8217;s for co-operation on supervision and enforcement. Lloyd&#8217;s, which is regulated by both the PRA and FCA, has responsibility under the Lloyd&#8217;s Act 1982 (&#8220;the Lloyd&#8217;s Act&#8221;) for the implementation of certain PRA and FCA prescribed rules relating to the operation of the Lloyd&#8217;s market. Lloyd&#8217;s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. The PRA and FCA directly monitor compliance of Lloyd&#8217;s managing agents with the systems and controls that Lloyd&#8217;s prescribes. 

The Council of Lloyd&#8217;s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd&#8217;s underwriting. For example, it may change the basis of allocation for syndicate expenses or the capital requirements for syndicate participations. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member, such as Chaucer, in a given underwriting year. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd&#8217;s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates. 

&#160;

We participate in the Lloyd&#8217;s market through our ownership of CSL, a managing agent with responsibility for the management of Syndicates 1084 and 1176, for which we provide capital to support their underwriting activities. Our membership in Lloyd&#8217;s requires us to comply with its bylaws and regulations, the Lloyd&#8217;s Act and the applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000. These include the requirement to provide capital (referred to as &#8220;Funds at Lloyd&#8217;s&#8221;) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount agreed with by Lloyd&#8217;s under the capital setting regime of the PRA. The completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise enables each corporate member to calculate the capital required. These requirements allow Lloyd&#8217;s to evaluate whether each corporate member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. 

If a corporate member of Lloyd&#8217;s is unable to meet its policyholder obligations, such obligations may be payable by the Lloyd&#8217;s Central Fund, which acts similar to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd&#8217;s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on all current Lloyd&#8217;s members. The Council of Lloyd&#8217;s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member&#8217;s underwriting capacity as a Central Fund contribution. 

Solvency II 

In 2009, the European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) adopted a directive covering capital requirements, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurance organizations. The directive, known as Solvency II, imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all E.U. member states that comprise three &#8220;pillars&#8221;. First, there are quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet of an insurance organization. Second, Solvency II requires insurance organizations to undertake a qualitative regulatory review, including governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and the supervisory review process. Third, to enhance market discipline, insurance organizations must report their financial conditions to regulators. W e believe that we are in compliance with the new regulatory regime , &#160; which commenced January 1, 2016 . 

Other 

In addition to the U.K. and E.U. regulations, Chaucer is subject to regulation in the U.S through the Lloyd&#8217;s market. The Lloyd&#8217;s market has licenses to engage in insurance business in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands and operates as an eligible excess and surplus lines insurer in all other states and territories. Lloyd&#8217;s is also an accredited reinsurer in all states and territories. Lloyd&#8217;s maintains various trust funds in the state of New York to protect its U.S. business and is subject to regulation by the New York Insurance Department, which acts as the domiciliary department for Lloyd&#8217;s U.S. trust funds. There are also deposit trust funds in other U.S. states to support Lloyd&#8217;s excess and surplus lines insurance and reinsurance business. 

See also Note 1 8 &#8212; &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 

INVOLUNTARY RESIDUAL MARKETS 

As a condition of our license to write business in various domestic states and international jurisdictions, we are required to participate in mandatory property and casualty residual market mechanisms which provide insurance coverages where such coverage may not otherwise be available at rates deemed reasonable. Such mechanisms provide coverage primarily for personal and commercial property, personal and commercial automobile, and workers&#8217; compensation, and include assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and involuntary pools, joint underwriting associations, fair access to insurance requirements (&#8220;FAIR&#8221;) plans, and commercial automobile insurance plans. 

For example, since most states compel the purchase of a minimal level of automobile liability insurance, states have developed shared market mechanisms to provide the required coverages and in many cases, optional coverages, to those drivers who, because of their driving records or other factors, cannot find insurers who will insure them voluntarily. Also, FAIR plans and other similar property insurance shared market mechanisms increase the availability of property insurance in circumstances where homeowners are unable to obtain insurance at rates deemed reasonable, such as in coastal areas or in areas subject to other hazards. Licensed insurers writing business in such states are often required to pay assessments to cover reserve deficiencies generated by such plans. 

With respect to FAIR plans and other similar property insurance shared market mechanisms that have significant exposures, it is difficult to accurately estimate our potential financial exposure for future events. Assessments following a large coastal event, particularly affecting Massachusetts, Florida, Louisiana or New York, could be material to our results of operations. Our participation in such shared markets or pooling mechanisms is generally proportional to our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific pooling mechanism in the applicable state or other jurisdiction. For example, we are subject to mandatory participation in the Michigan Assigned Claims (&#8220;MAC&#8221;) facility. MAC is an assigned claim plan covering people injured in uninsured motor vehicle accidents. Our participation in the MAC facility is based on our share of personal and commercial automobile direct written premium in the state and resulted in underwriting losses of $ 12.1 million in 2015, $ 11.7 million in 2014 and $15.0 million in 2013. Additionally, Chaucer&#8217;s U.K. motor line was subject to similar mandatory assessments from the U.K. Motor Insurance Bureau (&#8220;MIB&#8221;) and these assessments were $2.0 million in 2015, $4.0 million in 2014 and $4.3 million in 2013. There were no other mandatory residual market mechanisms that were significant to our 2015, 2014 or 2013 results of operations.

RESERVE FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES 

Reference is made to &#8220;Results of Operations - Segments &#8211; Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses&#8221; of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K. 

The following table reconciles reserves determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by U.S. insurance statutory authorities (&#8220;U.S. Statutory&#8221;) and the U.K. financial services regulatory authorities (&#8220;U.K. Statutory&#8221;) for our domestic and Chaucer operations, respectively, to reserves determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). The primary difference between the U.S. Statutory reserves and our U.S. GAAP reserves is the requirement, on a U.S. GAAP basis, to present reinsurance recoverables as an asset, whereas U.S. Statutory guidance provides that reserves are reflected net of the corresponding reinsurance recoverables. There are no significant differences between U.K. Statutory reserves and our U.S. GAAP reserves. We do not use discounting techniques in establishing U.S. GAAP reserves for losses and LAE, nor have we participated in any loss portfolio transfers or other similar transactions.

ANALYSIS OF LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT 

The following table sets forth the development of our U.S. GAAP reserves (net of reinsurance recoverables) for unpaid losses and LAE from 2005 through 2015. This table includes our Chaucer segment U.S. GAAP reserves beginning December 31, 2011.

(1) 

Sets forth the estimated net liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date at the end of each of the indicated years; represents the estimated amount of net losses and LAE for claims arising in the current and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) reserves. 

(2) 

Cumulative loss and LAE payments made in succeeding years for losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date. Chaucer claims payments denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates during the year of payment and are not revalued at the current year foreign exchange rates. Because claims paid in prior years are not revalued at the current year&#8217;s foreign exchange rates, the difference between the cumulative claims paid at the end of any given year and the immediately previous year represents the claims paid during the year. 

(3) 

Re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience for each succeeding year; increased or decreased as payments are made and more information becomes known about the severity of remaining unpaid claims. Chaucer unpaid losses and LAE denominated in foreign currencies are re-estimated using the foreign exchange rates in effect as of each respective re-estimation date. For example, 2013 reserves re-estimated one year later are re-estimated using the December 31, 2014 rates and two years later are re-estimated using December 31, 2015 rates. The resulting cumulative foreign exchange translation effect is shown as an adjustment to the cumulative net redundancy (deficiency) based on the rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. 

(4) 

Cumulative redundancy or deficiency at December 31, 2015 of the net and gross reserve amounts shown in the corresponding column. A redundancy in reserves means the reserves established in prior years exceeded actual losses and LAE or were re-evaluated at less than the original reserved amount. A deficiency in reserves means the reserves established in prior years were less than actual losses and LAE or were re-evaluated at more than the original reserved amount. 

REINSURANCE 

Reinsurance Program Overview 

We maintain ceded reinsurance programs designed to protect against large or unusual loss and LAE activity. We utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements, which are intended to control our individual policy and aggregate exposure to large property and casualty losses, stabilize earnings and protect capital resources. These programs include facultative reinsurance (to limit exposure on a specified policy); specific excess and proportional treaty reinsurance (to limit exposure on individual policies or risks within specified classes of business); and catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance (to limit exposure to any one event that might impact more than one individual contract). Catastrophe reinsurance protects us, as the ceding insurer, from significant losses arising from a single event including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fire, explosions and terrorism. We determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured, exposure analyses prepared by consultants, our risk appetite and on market conditions, including the availability and pricing of reinsurance. 

We cede to reinsurers a portion of our risk based upon insurance policies subject to such reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered, limit and retention, arbitration and occurrence. We believe our reinsurers are financially sound, based upon our ongoing review of their financial statements, financial strength ratings assigned to them by rating agencies, their reputations in the reinsurance marketplace, our collections history, advice from third parties, and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors. 

Although we exclude coverage of nuclear, chemical or biological events from the Personal Lines and Commercial Lines policies we write in the U.S., we are statutorily required to provide this coverage in our workers&#8217; compensation policies. We have workers&#8217; compensation reinsurance coverage under our casualty reinsurance treaty of approximately $ 80 million for terrorism losses , limited to approximately $10 million for losses that result from nuclear, chemical or biolog ical events. All other U.S.-based exposure or treaties exclude such coverage. Further, under TRIPRA, our retention of U.S. domestic losses in 2016 from such events, if deemed certified terrorist events, is limited to 16% of losses in excess of an approxima te $38 1 million deductible, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. Such events could be material to our financial position or results of operations. See &#8220;Terrorism&#8221; for additional information. 

Reference is made to Note 1 6 &#8212; &#8220;Reinsurance&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Reference is also made to &#8220;Involuntary Residual Markets&#8221;. 

Commercial and Personal Lines 

Our 2016 reinsurance program for our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments is substantially consistent with our 2015 program design. The following discussion summarizes both our 2015 and 2016 reinsurance programs for our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments (excluding coverage available under the U.S. federal terrorism program which is described under &#8220;Terrorism&#8221;), but does not purport to be a complete description of the program or the various restrictions or limitations which may apply: 

&#183; 

Our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments were primarily protected by a property catastrophe occurrence treaty, a property per risk excess of loss treaty, as well as a casualty excess of loss treaty, with retentions of $200 million, $2 million, and $2 million, respectively. We have lower retentions in place for certain lines, as discussed below. 

&#183; 

The property catastrophe occurrence treaty provides coverage, on an occurrence basis, up to $1.1 billion countrywide, less a $200 million retention, with no co-participation, for all defined perils. As of July 1, 2015, the program was completely placed on a multi-year basis. 

&#183; 

The property per risk excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per risk basis, up to $100 million, less a $2 million retention, with no co-participations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The casualty excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per occurrence basis for each loss, up to $75 million less a $2 million retention, with no co-participation. Umbrella and excess liability lines share coverage with casualty lines within the $2 million to $10 million layers, subject to a maximum umbrella limit of $5 million. There is also separate umbrella and excess liability only coverage that provides protection in both 2015 and 2016 for the $5 million to $25 million layer. The 2015 casualty program provides coverage for management liability, professional liability and healthcare lines in a $1 million to $2 million layer, whereas the 2016 casualty program will provide coverage for management liability and healthcare lines in a $1 million to $2 million layer, with co-participation of 50% for management liability. 

&#183; 

For 2015 and 2016, Commercial Lines segments are further protected by excess of loss treaty agreements for specific lines of business. For example, the surety and fidelity bond excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per principal basis, up to $40 million, less a $5 million retention, with co-participations ranging from 5% to 15% for individual layers placed within the treaty. 

&#183; 

In addition to certain layers of coverage from our Commercial and Personal Lines segment reinsurance program as described above, the Commercial Lines AIX Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;AIX&#8221;) program business also includes surplus share, quota share, excess of loss, facultative and other forms of reinsurance that cover the writings from AIX specialty and proprietary programs. There are approximately 48 different AIX programs, and the reinsurance structure is customized to fit the exposure profile for each program. 

Our intention is to renew the surety and fidelity bond treaty, the property per risk excess of loss treaty and the property catastrophe treaty in July 2016 with the same or similar terms and conditions, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current levels of reinsurance, pricing and terms and conditions. Our 2016 casualty excess of loss treaty is effective January 1, 2016 for a twelve month period. 

Chaucer 

Chaucer&#8217;s 2016 reinsurance program is substantially consistent with the 2015 program design. The 2015 and 2016 Chaucer reinsurance programs contain a combination of reinsurance treaties that either provide coverage across several lines or are specific to individual lines of business or classes of business within certain lines. Generally, for each line or class of Chaucer&#8217;s business, there are a variety of proportional, excess of loss (mainly occurrence basis), facultative and other treaty forms, which work in conjunction to manage against severity, and to a certain extent, frequency. Chaucer&#8217;s 2016 net retentions are generally consistent with the 2015 and 2014 levels. 

The Chaucer programs described below are substantially in place as of February 1, 2016 and we expect to implement throughout the year any remaining parts of the program as described; however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in placing reinsurance for each line as planned. The following discussion summarizes both our 2015 and 2016 reinsurance programs for the Chaucer segment, but does not purport to be a complete description of the program or the various restrictions or limitations which may apply. The limit figures below are presented net of treaty co-participation. 

We purchase proportional and non-proportional reinsurance, which is intended to provide sufficient underwriting capacity to effectively conduct business in the Lloyd&#8217;s market and to protect against frequency and severity of losses. 

For the property lines reinsurance coverage in 2015 and 2016: 

&#183; 

The direct property catastrophe occurrence reinsurance for selected international territories provides coverage up to approximately $38 million and $44 million, less retentions of approximately $8 millio n for both years. 

&#183; 

The assumed property catastrophe reinsurance for selected international territories provides coverage up to approximately $104 million and $108 million, less retentions of approximately $19 million for both years. Additionally, the assumed property catastrophe occurrence reinsurance for the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico provides coverage up to approximately $110 million and $114 million, less retentions of approximately $25 million for both years. For both 2015 and 2016, our assumed property catastrophe coverage is placed partially on an occurrence, and partially on an aggregate basis. 

&#183; 

The direct property per risk excess of loss reinsurance provides coverage up to approximately $10 million for both years, less retentions of approximately $3 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The assumed property per risk excess of loss reinsurance provides coverage up to approximately $10 million for both years, less retentions of approximately $5 million for both years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The majority of the casualty direct and facultative portfolio has reinsurance coverage in 2015 and 2016 of up to approximately $29 million and $38 million, less a retention of approximately $2 million for both years. The US casualty treaty portfolio has workers&#8217; compensation catastrophe reinsurance coverage of up to $63 million in 2015 and 2016, less a retention of $8 million for both years. 

For the energy, marine and aviation lines reinsurance coverage in 2015 and 2016: 

&#183; 

The nuclear energy lines occurrence reinsurance provides coverage up to approximately $163 million and $197 million, less retentions of approximately $51 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The non-nuclear energy lines occurrence reinsurance provides coverage up to approximately $140 million for both years, less retentions of approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively. 

&#183; 

The direct marine lines excess of loss reinsurance provides coverage, on a per occurrence basis, up to approximately $101 million and $102 million, respectively, less retentions of approximately $5 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The assumed marine excess of loss reinsurance provid es coverage, on an occurrence basis, up to approximately $30 million for both years, less retentions of approximately $7 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The direct political violence lines reinsurance provides coverage, on a per occurrence basis, up to approximately $76 million and $106 million, respectively, less retentions of approximately $8 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The direct political risks lines reinsurance provides coverage on a per risk basis, up to approximately $16 million and $13 million , less retentions of $4 million and $3 million, respectively. The direct credit lines reinsurance provides coverage on a per risk basis, up to approximately $8 million and $7 million, less retentions of $2 million and $3 million, respectively. In addition, event coverage is provided for both lines of business up to $30 million , less retentions of $10 million for both years. 

&#183; 

The aviation lines reinsurance provides coverage, on a per occurrence basis, up to approximately $48 million and $63 million, respectively, less retentions of approximately $3 million for both years. 

Prior to its transfer, the U.K. motor line had protection from a reinsurance program placed on a losses occurring basis, which was unlimited in excess of $1.5 million, both in terms of the amount and the number of losses sustained. For 2015, there was co-participation on the $1.5 million in excess of $1.5 million layer of 9.5%. Since the transfer on June 30, 2015, the U.K. motor line is 100% reinsured. 

For Chaucer&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 U.S. casualty treaty lines, we have entered into a whole account aggregate excess of loss contract. For 2015 and 2016, the contract covers the U.S. casualty treaty lines exposures, except specialty risks and workers&#8217; compensation clash, and provides coverage up to a 117% loss ratio, less retention of a 47% loss ratio. This contract does not meet the risk transfer requirements of GAAP and is accounted for using the deposit accounting method. The deposit asset for this contract was approximately $32 million as of December 31, 2015. 

Reinsurance Recoverables 

Ot her than our investment portfolio, the single largest asset class is our reinsurance receivables, which consist of our estimate of amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to losses incurred to date (including losses incurred but not reported) and unearned premiums, net of amounts estimated to be uncollectible. This estimate depends upon a number of factors, including an estimate of the amount of reserves attributable to business written in various lines and in various years. This estimate is expected to be revised at each reporting period and such revisions, which could be material, affect our results of operations and financial position. Reinsurance recoverables include amounts due from both United States and state mandatory reinsurance or other risk sharing mechanisms, and private reinsurers to whom we have voluntarily ceded business. 

We are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various mandatory residual markets, facilities and pooling mechanisms. As a condition to conduct business in various states, we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms, facilities and pooling arrangements which usually are designed to provide insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage voluntarily or at rates deemed reasonable. These market mechanisms, facilities and pooling arrangements comprise $921.3 million of our total reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and unearned premiums at December 31, 2015 and include, among others, the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (&#8220;MCCA&#8221;). 

&#160;

The MCCA is a mandatory reinsurance association which reinsures claims under Michigan&#8217;s unlimited personal injury protection coverage which is required under all Michigan automobile insurance policies. The MCCA reinsures all such claims in excess of a statutorily established company retention, currently $545,000. Funding for MCCA comes from assessments against automobile insurers based upon their share of insured automobiles in the state. Insurers are allowed to pass along this cost to Michigan automobile policyholders. This recoverable accounted for 64% of our total personal automobile gross reserves at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. Reinsurance recoverables related to MCCA were $906.5 million and $899.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Because the MCCA is supported by assessments permitted by statute, and there have been no significant uncollectible balances from MCCA identified during the three years ending December 31, 2015, we believe that we have no significant exposure to uncollectible reinsurance balances from this entity. 

In addition to the reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms, facilities and pooling arrangements we have $1,713.7 million of reinsurance assets due from traditional reinsurers as of December 31, 2015. These amounts are due principally from highly-rated reinsurers, defined as rated A- or higher by A.M. Best Rating Agency or other equivalent rating. The following table displays balances recoverable from our ten largest reinsurance groups at December 31, 2015, along with the group&#8217;s rating from the indicated rating agency. The contractual obligations under reinsurance agreements are typically with individual subsidiaries of the group or syndicates at Lloyd&#8217;s and are not typically guaranteed by other group members or syndicates at Lloyd&#8217;s. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of paid losses recoverable, outstanding losses recoverable, incurred but not reported losses recoverable, and ceded unearned premium.

Reinsurance recoverable balances in the table above are shown before consideration of balances owed to reinsurers and any potential rights of offset, including collateral held by us, and are net of an allowance for uncollectible recoverables. Reinsurance treaties are generally purchased on an annual basis. Treaties typically contain provisions that allow us to demand that a reinsurer post letters of credit or assets as security if a reinsurer is an unauthorized reinsurer under applicable regulations or if its rating falls below a predetermined contractual level. In regards to reinsurance recoverables due from Lloyd&#8217;s Syndicates, as part of the Lloyd&#8217;s &#8220;chain of security&#8221; afforded to all of its policyholders, recourse is available to the Lloyd&#8217;s Central Fund in the event of the failure of an individual syndicate and its capital providers. 

Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Specifically, our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims. In addition, from time to time insurers and reinsurers may disagree on the scope of the reinsurance or on the underlying insured risks. Any of these events would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We have established a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2015, which was determined by considering reinsurer specific default risk on paid and unpaid recoverables as indicated by their financial strength ratings, any current risk of dispute on paid recoverables, our collection experience and the development of our ceded loss reserves. There have been no significant balances determined to be uncollectible and thus no significant charges recorded during 2015 for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. 

&#160;

Our exposure to credit risk from any one reinsurer is managed through diversification by reinsuring with a number of different reinsurers, principally in the United States and European reinsurance markets. When reinsurance for our Commercial and Personal Lines segments is placed, our standards of acceptability generally require that a reinsurer must have a minimum policyholder surplus of $500 million, a rating from A.M. Best and/or S&#38;P of &#8220;A&#8221; or better, or an equivalent financial strength if not rated. Similarly, the Chaucer segment generally requires all reinsurers to have a rating from S&#38;P of &#8220;A-&#8221; or better and minimum level of net assets of $500 million. In addition, for lower rated reinsurers, certain reinsurers for our United States insurance operations that have not been granted authorized status by an insurance company&#8217;s state of domicile, and in certain other circumstances, reinsurers must generally provide collateral equal to 100% of estimated reinsurance recoverables. The collateral can serve to mitigate credit risk. 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

Discontinued operations primarily include our former life insurance businesses, which were sold prior to 2009, and our discontinued accident and health business. 

Our former life insurance businesses include indemnity obligations for which we have established reserves. 

The discontinued accident and health business includes interests in 25 accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements that we retained subsequent to the sale of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company (&#8220;FAFLIC&#8221;), all of which were assumed by Hanover Insurance in connection with the transaction. We ceased writing new premiums in this business in 1999, subject to certain contractual obligations. The reinsurance pool business consists primarily of the medical and disability portions of workers&#8217; compensation risks, long-term care, assumed personal accident, individual medical, long-term disability, and special risk business. This business also includes residual health insurance policies. Total claim reserves for the assumed accident and health business wer e $ 88.7 million at December 31, 2015, net of recoverables from third party reinsurers of $ 0.5 m illion at December 31, 2015. Assets and liabilities related to the discontinued accident and health business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. 

Loss estimates associated with substantially all of the discontinued accident and health business are provided by managers of each pool. We adopt reserve estimates for this business that consider this information, expected returns on assets assigned to this business and other facts. We update these reserves as new information becomes available and further events occur that may affect the ultimate resolution of unsettled claims. We believe that the reserves recorded related to this business are adequate. However, since reserve and loss cost estimates related to the discontinued accident and health business are dependent on several assumptions, including, but not limited to, future health care costs, persistency of medical care inflation, investment performance, claims, particularly in the long-term care business, morbidity and mortality assumptions, and these assumptions can be impacted by technical developments and advancements in the medical field and other factors, there can be no assurance that the reserves established for this business will prove sufficient. Revisions to these reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position. 

Discontinued operations, in total, generated a net gain o f $0. 7 million during 2015, and primarily related to our former life insurance businesses. Reference is made to &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221; in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K. 

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 

We held $ 8.3 billion of investment assets, including cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 201 5 . Approximately 84 % of our investment assets were comprised of fixed maturities, which included both investment grade and below investment grade public and private debt securities; 7 % consisted of equity securities; &#160; 5 % included other investments which consisted primarily of &#160; mortgage and other loans, overseas deposits and limited partnerships ; and the remaining 4 % were comprised of cash and cash equivalents . These investments are generally of high quality and our fixed maturities and equities are broadly diversified across sectors of the fixed income and equity markets. 

Opus manages our investment portfolio, including the selection and monitoring of external asset managers for our non-U.S. dollar fixed maturity portfolios, U.S. commercial mortgage loan participations and certain other investments. Our overall investment strategy is intended to balance investment income with credit and interest rate risk, while maintaining sufficient liquidity and providing the opportunity for capital growth. The asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes. We look to balance the goals of capital preservation, net investment income stability, liquidity and total return. For certain portfolios in which fixed maturities are denominated in U.K. pounds sterling and Euros, we employ two external asset managers with international market expertise to manage these portfolios. Assets managed by these asset managers totaled approximately $ 372 million of non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments at December 31, 2015. We select and monitor managers based on investment style, performance and corporate governance. &#160; 

&#160;

The majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets. Through fundamental research and credit analysis, with a focus on value investing, we seek to identify a portfolio of stable income-producing higher quality U.S. government, foreign government, municipal, corporate, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. We have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industry sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk. We monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets, borrowers, industries, sectors and, in the case of &#160; commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage loan participations, property types and geographic locations. 

Investments held by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to diversification requirements under state insurance laws and other regulatory requirements. The investment portfolio duration is approximately 4.3 years and is generally maintained in the range of 1 to 2 times the duration of our insurance liabilities. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to support our cash flow requirements by monitoring the cash requirements associated with our insurance and corporate liabilities, laddering the maturities within the portfolio, closely monitoring our investment durations, holding high quality liquid public securities and managing the purchases and sales of assets. 

Reference is made to &#8220;Investments&#8221; in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K. 

RATING AGENCIES 

Insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies&#8217; opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. 

We believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers, since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe that a rating of &#8220;A-&#8221; or higher from A.M. Best Co. is particularly important for our business. Insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors.
