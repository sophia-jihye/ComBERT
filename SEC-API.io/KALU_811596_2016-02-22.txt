Business Overview 

Kaiser Aluminum Corporation&#8217;s primary line of business is the production of semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products. Fabricated aluminum mill products are broadly defined to include flat-rolled, extruded, drawn, forged and cast aluminum products used in a variety of end market applications. We focus on technically challenging applications for flat-rolled and extruded/drawn products that allow us to utilize our core metallurgical and process technology capabilities to produce highly engineered products with differentiated characteristics that present opportunities for us to receive premium pricing. The key end market applications we have strategically chosen to serve are aerospace/high strength ("Aero/HS products"), automotive ("Automotive Extrusions") and general engineering ("GE products"). We additionally produce a small amount of products for other end market applications ("Other products"). In 2015 , we produced and shipped from our 12 North American facilities approximately 615.4 million &#32;pounds of semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products, which comprised all of our consolidated net sales of approximately $1.4 billion . 

A fundamental part of our business model is to mitigate the impact of aluminum price volatility. We purchase primary and scrap aluminum, our main raw material, at prices that fluctuate on a monthly basis, and we use pricing policies that generally allow us to pass metal cost fluctuations through to our customers. For some of our higher value added products sold on a spot basis, however, the pass through of metal price movements can sometimes lag by as much as several months. Additionally, we often enter into firm-price customer sales agreements that specify the underlying metal price plus a conversion price. Spot sales with lagged metal price pass through and firm-price sales agreements create metal price exposure for us which we mitigate through a hedging program. Our pricing policies and hedging program are designed to largely mitigate the impact on our profitability of fluctuations in underlying metal price. 

&#32;1 

At December 31, 2015, we operated 12 focused production facilities, 11 in the United States and one in Canada, with approximately 2,790 employees. 

We have long-standing relationships with our customers, which consist primarily of blue-chip companies including leading aerospace companies, automotive suppliers and metal service centers. In our served markets, we seek to be the supplier of choice by pursuing "Best in Class" customer satisfaction driven by quality, availability, service and delivery performance. We further seek to differentiate ourselves by offering a broad product portfolio including our KaiserSelect &#174; &#32;products, which are engineered and manufactured to deliver enhanced product characteristics with improved consistency, so as to result in better performance, lower waste and, in many cases, lower production cost for our customers. 

We have a culture of continuous improvement that is facilitated by the Kaiser Production System ("KPS"), an integrated application of tools such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma and Total Productive Manufacturing. We believe KPS enables us to continuously reduce our own manufacturing costs and eliminate waste throughout the value chain. We strive to tightly integrate the management of the operations within our Fabricated Products segment across multiple production facilities, product lines and target markets in order to maximize the efficiency of product flow to our customers. 

In recent years, we have pursued significant capital spending initiatives to expand manufacturing capabilities, increase capacity, improve efficiency and enhance product quality. The most significant of these initiatives was a series of investments that more than doubled our capacity and expanded our manufacturing capability to produce thick heat treat plate at our Spokane, Washington ("Trentwood") facility in order to capitalize on significant demand growth for aerospace applications. We recently commenced a multi-year, $150.0 million capital investment project at our Trentwood facility focused on equipment upgrades throughout the process flow to reduce conversion costs and increase efficiency, further improving our competitive cost position on all products produced at Trentwood. A significant portion of the investment will be focused on modernizing the legacy equipment and process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve KaiserSelect &#174; &#32;quality enhancements for both aerospace and general engineering applications. The investments will also result in further expansion of Trentwood&#8217;s manufacturing capacity. Additionally, we have invested to support sizable growth in demand for automotive applications by upgrading existing extrusion presses at each of our automotive focused extrusion facilities to enhance capabilities and by adding new extrusion press capacity within our automotive manufacturing platform. 

Kaiser Aluminum was founded by Henry J. Kaiser in 1946 with the lease and eventual purchase of three aluminum facilities from the United States Government. Over the ensuing decades, Kaiser Aluminum grew to become a fully-integrated aluminum company involved in virtually all aspects of the aluminum industry, including the mining and refining of bauxite into alumina, the production of primary aluminum from alumina, and the manufacture of fabricated and semi-fabricated aluminum products. From 2000 to 2010, as a result of a strategic reassessment of our competitive positions in the upstream and downstream portions of the aluminum industry, we divested or closed our non-strategic bauxite mining, alumina refining, and primary aluminum operations and focused on downstream operations where we had a competitive advantage. Following this restructuring of our business operations, we no longer participate in commodity segments within the aluminum industry and focus solely on the production of semi-fabricated specialty aluminum products for major suppliers and manufacturers for applications in our chosen Aero/HS, Automotive Extrusions, GE and other end-markets. 

Business Operations 

Consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates our business, our Fabricated Products business is treated as a single operating segment. In addition to the Fabricated Products segment, we have one business unit, All Other, which provides general and administrative support for our operations. For purposes of segment reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we treat the Fabricated Products segment as its own reportable segment. All Other is not considered a reportable segment. 

Fabricated Products Segment 

Overview 

Our Fabricated Products segment focuses on producing rolled, extruded and drawn aluminum products used principally for aerospace and defense, automotive, consumer durables, electronics, electrical and machinery and equipment applications. During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our North American manufacturing facilities produced and shipped approximately 615.4 million , 588.8 million &#32;and 563.7 million &#32;pounds of fabricated aluminum products, respectively, which accounted for all of our total net sales.

Aero/HS Products. &#32;Our Aero/HS products include high quality heat treat plate and sheet, as well as cold finish rod and bar, seamless drawn tube, hard alloy extrusions and billet that are manufactured to demanding specifications for the global aerospace and defense industries. These industries use our products in applications that demand such properties as high tensile strength, superior fatigue resistance and exceptional durability even in harsh environments. For instance, aerospace manufacturers use high-strength 2000- and 7000-series alloys for a variety of structures that must perform consistently under extreme variations in temperature and altitude. Our Aero/HS products are used for a wide variety of end uses. We make aluminum plate, sheet, extruded shapes and tube for aerospace applications and we manufacture a variety of specialized rod and bar products that are incorporated in diverse applications. The aerospace and defense industries' consumption of fabricated aluminum products is driven by factors that include overall levels of airframe build rates, the mix of aircraft models being built and defense spending, as well as the usage of competing materials such as titanium and composites. Demand has increased for thick plate with growth in monolithic construction of commercial and other aircraft. In monolithic construction, aluminum plate is heavily machined to form the desired part from a single piece of metal (as opposed to creating parts using aluminum sheet, extrusions or forgings that are affixed to one another using rivets, bolts or welds). 

Automotive Extrusions. &#32;Automotive Extrusions consist of extruded aluminum products for many North American automotive applications. Examples of the variety of extruded products that we supply to the automotive industry include extruded products for the body-in-white structural components, bumper systems, anti-lock braking systems and drawn tube for drive shafts. For some Automotive Extrusions, we perform limited fabrication, including sawing and cutting to length. Demand for Automotive Extrusions is determined based upon automotive build rates in North America and increasing aluminum content. As automotive manufacturers continue to reduce the weight of vehicles to achieve greater fuel efficiency and comply with stringent federal regulations, applications historically made from steel are being converted to aluminum, which has the required mechanical properties but at a much lighter weight. 

GE Products. &#32;Our GE products consist primarily of 6000-series alloy plate, sheet, rod, bar, tube, wire and standard extrusions. The 6000-series alloy is an extrudable medium-strength alloy that is heat treatable and extremely versatile. Our GE products have a wide range of uses and applications, many of which involve further fabrication for numerous transportation and other industrial end market applications where machining of plate, rod and bar is intensive. For example, our GE products are used in the enhancement and production of military vehicles, ordnances, semiconductor manufacturing cells, numerous electronic devices, after-market motor sport parts and tooling plates. Our rod and bar products are manufactured into rivets, nails, screws, bolts and parts for machinery and equipment. Demand growth and cyclicality for GE products tend to mirror broad economic patterns and industrial activity in North America. Demand is also impacted by the destocking and restocking of inventory throughout the supply chain. 

Other Products. &#32;Other products consist of extruded, drawn and cast billet aluminum products for a variety of North American industrial end uses. Demand for Other products tends to mirror broad economic patterns and industrial activity in North America. 

&#32;3 

Types of Manufacturing Processes Employed 

We utilize the following manufacturing processes to produce our fabricated products: 

Flat Rolling. &#32;The traditional manufacturing process for aluminum flat-rolled products uses ingot, a large rectangular slab of aluminum, as the starter material. The ingot is processed through a series of rolling operations, both hot and cold. Finishing steps may include heat treatment, annealing, stretching, leveling or slitting to achieve the desired metallurgical, dimensional and/or performance characteristics. Aluminum flat-rolled products are manufactured using a variety of alloys, a range of tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness) and widths and various finishes. Flat-rolled aluminum semi-finished products are generally either sheet (under 0.25 inches in thickness) or plate (0.25 inches or greater in thickness). The vast majority of the North American market for aluminum flat-rolled products uses "common alloy" plate and sheet for construction, beverage/food can and other applications. We have focused our efforts on "heat treat" products, which are distinguished from common alloy products by higher strength and other desired product attributes. The primary end market applications of flat-rolled heat treat plate and sheet are for Aero/HS and GE products. 

Extrusion. &#32;The extrusion process typically starts with a cast billet, which is an aluminum cylinder of varying length and diameter. The first step in the process is to heat the billet to an elevated temperature whereby the metal is malleable. The billet is put into an extrusion press and pushed, or extruded, through a die that gives the material the desired two-dimensional cross section. The material is either quenched as it leaves the press, or subjected to a post-extrusion heat treatment cycle, to control the material&#8217;s physical properties. The extrusion is then straightened typically by stretching and cutting to length before being hardened in aging ovens. The largest end market applications for extruded products are in the construction, general engineering and custom products. Building and construction products represent the single largest end market application for extrusions by a significant amount. However, we have strategically chosen to focus on Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions, GE products and Other products, utilizing our well-developed technical expertise, strong production capability and high product quality to meet the requirements of these more demanding applications. 

Drawing. &#32;Drawing is a fabrication operation in which extruded tubes and rods are pulled through a die, or drawn. The primary purpose of drawing is to reduce the diameter and wall thickness while improving physical properties and dimensions. Material may go through multiple drawing steps to achieve the final dimensional specifications. We use drawing in connection with certain of our Aero/HS and Automotive Extrusion products. 

A description of the manufacturing processes and category of products at each of our production facilities at December 31, 2015 &#32;is shown below:

Flat Rolling 

As reflected by the table above, many of our facilities employ the same basic manufacturing process and produce the same types of products. We make a significant effort to tightly integrate the management of our Fabricated Products segment across multiple manufacturing locations, product lines and end market applications to maximize the efficiency of product flow to customers. We centralize purchasing of our primary aluminum requirements in order to better manage price, credit and other benefits. Our sales force and the management thereof are also significantly integrated as many customers purchase a number of different products that are produced at different plant facilities. We believe that integration of our operations allows us to capture efficiencies while allowing our facilities to remain highly focused on their specific processes and end market applications. 

&#32;4 

Raw Materials 

To make our fabricated products, we purchase primary aluminum and recycled and secondary scrap aluminum from third party suppliers in varying percentages depending on various market factors, including price and availability. The price for primary aluminum purchased for the Fabricated Products segment is typically based on the Average Midwest Transaction Price ("Midwest Price"), which reflects the primary aluminum supply/demand dynamics in North America. Recycled and scrap aluminum is typically purchased at a discount to ingot prices but can require additional processing. The average Midwest Price, comprised of the average London Metal Exchange ("LME") plus average Midwest premium, per pound of primary aluminum for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , were $0.75 &#32;+ $0.13 , $0.85 &#32;+ $0.20 &#32;and $0.84 &#32;+ $0.11 , respectively. At February 12, 2016 , the LME plus Midwest premium transaction price per pound was $0.68 &#32;+ $0.09 . 

In addition to producing fabricated aluminum products for sale to third parties, certain of our production facilities provide one another with billet, log, or other intermediate material for further production in lieu of purchasing such items from third-party suppliers. For example, our Newark, Ohio facility supplies billet and log to the Jackson, Tennessee facility and redraw rod to the Florence, Alabama facility. 

Pricing, Metal Price Risk Management and Hedging 

As noted above, we purchase primary and secondary aluminum, our principal raw material, on a floating price basis typically based on the Midwest Price. Our pricing of fabricated aluminum products is generally intended to lock in a conversion margin (representing the value added from the fabrication process(es)) and to pass metal price fluctuation through to our customers. We manage the risk of fluctuations in the price of aluminum through our pricing policies and use of financial derivatives. Our three principal pricing mechanisms are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Spot price. &#32;Some of our customers pay a product price that incorporates the spot price of primary aluminum (LME plus Midwest premium) in effect at the time of shipment to a customer. Spot prices for these products change regularly based on competitive dynamics. Fluctuation in the underlying aluminum price is a significant factor influencing changes in competitive spot prices. This pricing mechanism typically allows us to pass metal price risk through to the customers. For some of our higher value added products sold on a spot basis, the pass through of metal price movements can sometimes lag by as much as several months, with a favorable impact to us when metal prices decline and an adverse impact to us when metal prices increase. We, from time to time, enter into hedging transactions with third parties to minimize the impact to us of metal price swings for these higher value added products. 

&#8226; 

Index-based price. &#32;Some of our customers pay a product price that incorporates an index-based price for primary aluminum, such as Platt&#8217;s Midwest price for primary aluminum. This pricing mechanism also typically allows us to pass metal price risk through to the customer. 

&#8226; 

Firm price. &#32;Some of our customers who commit to volumes and timing of delivery pay a firm price, creating metal price risk that we must hedge. We are able to limit exposure to metal price risks created by firm-price customer sales contracts by using third-party hedging instruments. Total fabricated product shipments for which we were subject to price risk were, in millions of pounds, 204.6 , 138.3 &#32;and 119.8 &#32;during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

All hedging activities are managed centrally to minimize transaction costs, monitor consolidated net exposures and allow for increased responsiveness to changes in market factors. Hedging activities are conducted in compliance with a policy approved by our Board of Directors and administered by our hedging committee (members of which include our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer). 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

Industry sales margins for fabricated products fluctuate in response to competitive and market dynamics. Sales are made directly to customers by our sales personnel located in the United States, Canada, Europe and China and by independent sales agents in other regions of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on the markets for Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions, GE products and Other products. 

Aero/HS Products. &#32;Approximately 49% of our Aero/HS product shipments are sold to metal service centers with the remainder sold directly to end market customers. Sales are made primarily under contracts (with terms spanning from one year to ten years) as well as on an order-by-order basis. We serve this market with a North American sales force focused on Aero/HS and GE products and direct sales representatives in Western Europe and China. 

Automotive Extrusions. &#32;Our Automotive Extrusions are sold primarily to first tier automotive suppliers under multi-year sales agreements. Almost all sales of Automotive Extrusions occur through direct channels using a North American direct sales force that works closely with our technical sales support organization. 

&#32;5 

GE Products. &#32;A majority of our GE products are sold to large metal service centers in North America on an order-by-order basis, with orders primarily consisting of standard catalog type items shipped with a relatively short lead-time. We service this market with a North American sales force focused on GE and Aero/HS products. 

Other Products. &#32;Other products are primarily sold directly to industrial end users on an order-by-order basis using a North American direct sales force. 

Customers 

In 2015 , our Fabricated Products segment had approximately 800 customers. Our two largest customers, Reliance Steel &#38; Aluminum Co. ("Reliance") and The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), accounted for approximately 25% &#32;and 10% , respectively, of our net sales in 2015 . While the loss of Reliance or Boeing as customers could have a material adverse effect on us, we believe that our long-standing relationship with each is good and that the risk of losing either as a customer is remote. See Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information about our significant concentrations, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

Research and Development 

We operate three research and development centers. Our Rolling and Heat Treat Center and our Metallurgical Analysis Center are both located at our Trentwood facility. The Rolling and Heat Treat Center has complete hot rolling, cold rolling and heat treat capabilities to simulate, in small lots, processing of flat-rolled products for process and product development on an experimental scale. The Metallurgical Analysis Center consists of a full metallographic laboratory and a scanning electron microscope to support research development programs as well as respond to plant technical service requests. The third center, our Solidification and Casting Center, is located in Newark, Ohio and has a developmental casting unit capable of casting billets and ingots for extrusion and rolling experiments. The casting unit is also capable of casting full size billets and ingots for processing on the production extrusion presses and rolling mills. See Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information about our research and development costs, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

A significant amount of our research and development is devoted to product and process development within our production operations, largely focused on controlling the manufacturing process to improve product quality, ensure consistency and enhance one or more specific product attributes. This has resulted in the creation and delivery of our highly differentiated KaiserSelect &#174; &#32;products, which are engineered and manufactured to deliver enhanced product characteristics with improved consistency, which results in such benefits as better performance, lower waste and, in many cases, lower production cost for our customers. 

All Other 

All Other provides general and administrative support to our operations. The expenses incurred in this business unit are not allocated to our other operations. All Other is not considered a reportable segment. 

Segment and Geographical Area Financial Information 

The information set forth in Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report regarding our GAAP reporting segment and the geographical areas in which we operate is incorporated herein by reference. 

Competition 

The fabricated aluminum industry is highly competitive. We focus our fabricating operations on technically challenging applications for flat-rolled heat treat plate and sheet and extruded/drawn products that allow us to apply our core metallurgical and process technology capabilities to produce highly engineered products with differentiated characteristics. We further differentiate ourselves from our competitors by pursuing "Best in Class" customer satisfaction, which is driven by quality, availability, service and delivery performance and having a broad product offering. 

Our primary competitors in the global market for Aero/HS products are Alcoa Inc., Constellium N.V. and Aleris Corporation. Our primary competitors in the market for GE products are Alcoa, Inc., Sapa AS, and in markets for certain GE products, we compete with imports and regional participants. We compete with Alcoa, Inc. and Sapa AS, along with other regional participants, in the market for Automotive Extrusions. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial resources and may have other strategic advantages. 

For heat treat plate and sheet products, particularly for aerospace applications, new competition is limited by technological expertise that only a few companies have developed through significant investment in research and development and decades of 

&#32;6 

operating experience. Further, use of plate and sheet in safety critical applications makes quality and product consistency critical factors. Suppliers must pass a rigorous qualification process to sell to airframe manufacturers. Additionally, significant investment in infrastructure and specialized equipment is required to supply heat treat plate and sheet. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 2,790 people, of which approximately 2,730 were employed in our Fabricated Products segment and approximately 60 were employed in our corporate group, most of whom are located in our office in Foothill Ranch, California.
