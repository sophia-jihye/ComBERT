Strategy 

We are focused on strategies that we believe will enhance our long-term financial health and deliver long-term shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we plan to generate continued growth of our existing brands and products, as well as pursue new opportunities to develop, acquire or distribute new brands and products. We believe that we made substantial progress on increasing our profitability and increasing the value of our common stock during 2015.

For 2016, we plan to pursue the following primary goals: (1) continue to increase sales by strengthening and broadening consumer awareness of our products; (2) continue to add additional products to the mix of products that one or more of our existing major customers already buy from us; (3) continue to obtain new distribution of our products at retailers that currently do not buy products from us; and (4) continue to evaluate potential products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us.

&#160;

In order to achieve these goals, we made a strategic decision to, among other things, increase our advertising and marketing spending in 2015 and 2016 compared to the prior several years . We believe it is necessary and in our long-term best interests for us to make significant inv estment s in 2016 in the brands and products that we own. In 2015 we invested in consumer research, creative development and production of advertising and marketing assets for our new Alpha &#8482; Skin Care line of products (formerly our Alpha Hydrox&#174; Skin Care line of products) and our existing Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold&#174; line of products. In 2016 our investments will be in the advertising and marketing of these products to consumers using the benefits of our investments in 2015 . We do not expect to recognize in 201 6 the full benefits of the investments that we are making in 201 6 . Instead, we anticipate see ing the positive benefits over future periods. 

Household Products 

Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold &#174; Wood Cleaner and Preservative has been our core product since our inception. It has been sold in the United States for over 60 years. Unlike a furniture polish, our product contains natural oils that penetrate the wood&#8217;s surface to clean, replace lost moisture, minimize the appearance of scratches and bring out the natural beauty of wood. We have also introduced an additional wood care product in a wipe form and a wood wash product. Our Dust &#8217;N Go pre-moistened cloth wipes are quick, easy and convenient dusting wipes for wood and numerous other surfaces. Our wood wash product simply and safely cleans all types of wood surfaces. Late in the fourth quarter of 2013, we introduced our Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold &#174; Floor Restore product. This product is a quick and easy way to renew and protect hardwood floors.

Since 1982, we have sold Touch of Scent &#174; air fresheners. Our air fresheners offer a unique dispenser with aerosol refills. Touch of Scent &#174; air fresheners are available in a wide assortment of concentrated fragrances, which are quick, easy to use and effective. 

Household products accounted for 21.8% of our consolidated net sales in 2015 and 24.2% in 2014. We continually evaluate potential new household products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us. 

Skin and Hair Care Products 

In 1992, we began to develop, manufacture, market and sell skin care products under the trade name of Alpha Hydrox &#174; . These products include facial care products, a body lotion, a body wash and a foot cream. Our Alpha Hydrox &#174; skin care brand was one of the first to use AHAs. Products containing AHAs gently slough off dead skin cells to promote a healthier, more youthful appearance and help to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. Starting in 2016, our Alpha Hydrox&#174; Skin Care line of products will be marketed and sold under the trade name of Alpha &#8482; Skin Care. There were several reasons for the change in names, including the desire to reflect that our line of skin care products is broader than just products containing AHAs. 

Our Neoteric Diabetic &#174; Healing Cream product was introduced in 2001. This product was developed to address the skin conditions of persons living with diabetes, caused by poor blood circulation. Our healing cream is a therapeutic moisturizer that provides a clinically proven and patented treatment for dry skin by helping to increase blood circulation and speed the healing of minor scrapes and cuts. 

Since 2001, we have been the exclusive distributor in the United States for face masque sachets manufactured by Montagne Jeunesse International Ltd. (&#8220;Montagne Jeunesse&#8221;). Montagne Jeunesse is based in the United Kingdom. Their sachet products are currently sold in over 70 countries. These masques are sold for single use in unique and attractive packages in a wide assortment of types and fragrances. A significant portion of our business consists of the sale of these sachet products. See &#8220;Manufacturing and Suppliers&#8221; in this Item 1 below for information on the terms of our agreement with Montagne Jeunesse. 

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we became the exclusive distributor in the United States for Batiste Dry Shampoo with the exception of certain warehouse stores and governmental entities. Our new distribution agreement with the manufacturer of Batiste Dry Shampoo, Church &#38; Dwight Co. Inc. (&#8220;Church &#38; Dwight&#8221;), went into effect on January 1, 2015. Under the new distribution agreement we continue as an exclusive distributor in the United States of Batiste Dry Shampoo, but are limited to the specialty retailer channel. The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &#38; Fragrance, Inc. (&#8220;Ulta&#8221;), our largest customer, apparel retailers, department stores, hair salons and distributors to hair salons. Dry shampoo is a quick and convenient way to refresh hair between washes. Batiste was one of the innovators of dry shampoo. We believe that there is a large and fast-growing market for dry shampoo. See &#8220;Manufacturing and Suppliers&#8221; in this Item 1 below for information on the terms of our agreement with Church &#38; Dwight. 

Skin and hair care products accounted for 78.2% of our consolidated net sales in 2015 and 75.8% in 2014. We continually evaluate potential new skin and hair care products as well as other beauty care products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us. 

&#160;

Marketing and Distribution 

We primarily market our products through: (1) trade promotions to support price features, displays, slotting fees and other merchandising of our products by our retail customers; (2) consumer incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (3) consumer marketing in print, social and digital media and television advertising. 

Our products are sold nationally, both directly through our sales force and indirectly through independent brokers and manufacturers&#8217; representatives, to mass marketers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores and other retail outlets and to wholesale distributors.

In 2015 and 2014, Ulta accounted for approximately 31% and 26%, respectively, of our skin and hair care products and approximately 24% and 20% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015 and 2014, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (&#8220;Wal-Mart&#8221;) accounted for approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, of our net sales of household products. With regard to our skin and hair care products, Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 10% and 12% of our net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 15% and 18% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015 and 2014, TJ Maxx accounted for approximately 21% and 5%, respectively, of our skin and hair care products and approximately 16% and 4% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

As is typical in our industry, we do not have a long-term contract with Wal-Mart, TJ Maxx, Ulta or any other retail customer. 

We also use our Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold and Neoteric Cosmetics websites for sales of our products directly to consumers. Such sales accounted for approximately 8% and 5% of total net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Our household and skin and hair care products are available in limited distribution in Canada and other foreign countries. Currently, foreign sales are made to distributors who are responsible for the marketing of the products, and we are paid for these products in United States dollars. 

From time to time, our customers return products to us. For our household products, we permit returns only for a limited time. With regard to our skin and hair care products, returns are more frequent under an unwritten industry standard that permits returns for a variety of reasons. In the event a skin and hair care customer requests a return of a product, we will consider the request, and may grant such request in order to maintain or enhance our relationship with the customer, even in the absence of an enforceable right of the customer to do so. Typically, customers that return products to us take a credit on our invoice equal to the original sale price plus a handling charge ranging from 8-10% of the original sales price. 

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

We owned all of our manufacturing facilities until February 1, 2013, when we sold the facilities and entered into a lease with the new owner for a portion of the facilities. Please see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information on our leasing back certain of the manufacturing facilities that we sold. We own and operate all of our manufacturing equipment. We manufacture all of our products with the exception of the following products: (1) those products for which we act as a distributor; and (2) our Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold &#174; Dust &#8217;N Go wipes. For all of our products, we must maintain sufficient inventories to ship most orders as they are received. 

Quality control is enforced at all stages of production, as well as upon the receipt of raw materials from suppliers. Raw materials are purchased from a number of suppliers and, at the present time, are readily available. However, we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers and any contracts we do have with suppliers may be terminated at any time. Our sole supplier for the oxygenated oil used in our Neoteric Diabetic &#174; Healing Cream product is a French company with which we have a non-exclusive supply agreement. In addition, we have sole suppliers for two of the polymers used in our Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold &#174; Floor Restore product. We believe that we have good relationships with all of our suppliers. 

Most of our manufacturing operations, including most packaging, are highly automated, and, as a result, our manufacturing operations are not labor intensive, nor, for the most part, do they involve extensive training. We currently operate on a one-shift basis. Our manufacturing facilities are capable of producing substantially larger quantities of our products without any expansion, and, for that reason, we believe that our physical plant facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

In 2001, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Neoteric Cosmetics, Inc. (&#8220;Neoteric&#8221;), commenced purchases of skin care sachets from Montagne Jeunesse under a distri butorship agreement covering the United States. Pursuant to our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse that became effective on September 15, 2014 , we continue as the exclusive distributor to market and sell Montagne Jeunesse&#8217;s skin care sachets in the United States. The initial term of the distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse expires on September 15, 2017 and automatically renews for two year terms, unless terminated at the end of any such term upon six months prior no tice. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Neoteric agreed, among other things: (1) not to distribute during the duration of the agreement any goods of the same description as and which compete with the Montagne Jeunesse products; (2) to use our commercially reasonable endeavors to develop, promote and sell the products in the United States and to expand the sale of the products to all potential purchasers by all reasonable and proper means; (3) to purchase certain core products; and (4) to maintain an inventory of the products for our own account for sale of these products throughout the United States. Montagne Jeunesse agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all of our orders for the products. The initial pricing terms for the products were negotiated with Montagne Jeunesse. Any changes to the prices must be mutually agreed to by both parties and must be agreed to at least six months in advance. Neoteric may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under the agreement or subcontract the performance of any obligation. 

Under our new distribution agreement with Church &#38; Dwight that became effective on January 1, 2015, we are the exclusive distributor of Batiste Dry Shampoo products in the specialty retailer channel in the United States. The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta, our largest customer, apparel retailers, department stores, hair salons and distributors to hair salons. Church &#38; Dwight retained the rights to sell Batiste products to the remainder of the market in the United States. 

The agreement provides that we will not be permitted to manufacture, distribute or sell any products that are competitive with Batiste Dry Shampoo products. The initial pricing terms for the Batiste products were negotiated with Church &#38; Dwight, but may be increased by Church &#38; Dwight at any time upon 90 days&#8217; prior written notice of any price increase. The initial term of the agreement runs through December 31, 2016 and will automatically renew for successive one year terms until it is terminated by either party upon 120 days&#8217; prior written notice.

Competition 

Both the household and skin and hair care products markets are highly competitive. We compete in both markets against a range of competitors, most of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, name recognition and product and market diversification than us. We compete in both categories primarily on the basis of quality and the distinguishing characteristics of our products. The wood care and air freshener product categories are dominated by three to five companies that are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. In the skin and hair care category, several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. Some of these companies also manufacture products with AHAs with which our Alpha Hydrox &#174; products must compete.

Regulation 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the types of consumer products that we manufacture and sell. Many chemicals used in consumer products, some of which are used in several of our product formulations, have come under scrutiny by various state governments and the Federal government. These chemicals are called volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;), which arguably contribute to the formation of ground level ozone. Many states as well as the Federal government have passed regulations that limit the amount of VOCs allowed in various categories of consumer products. All of our products currently meet the most stringent VOC regulations and may be sold throughout the United States. Any new or revised VOC regulations developed by various states or the Federal government may apply to our products and could potentially require reformulation of those products in the future. Limitation of VOC content in consumer products by both state and Federal governments will continue to be part of regulatory efforts to achieve compliance with clean air regulations. We continue to monitor all environmental regulatory activities and believe that we have done all that is necessary to satisfy the current requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and the laws of various state governments. 

&#160;

Many of our skin care products, most of which contain AHAs, are considered cosmetics within the definition of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FFDCA&#8221;). The FFDCA defines cosmetics as products intended for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or altering the appearance without affecting the body&#8217;s structure or functions. Our cosmetic products are subject to the r egulations under the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The relevant laws and regulations are enforced by the FDA. Such laws and regulations govern the ingredients and labeling of cosmetic products and set forth good manufacturing practices for companies to follow. Although FDA regulations require that the safety of a cosmetic ingredient be substantiated prior to marketing, there is no requirement that a company submit the results of any testing performed or any other data or information with re spect to any ingredient to the FDA. 

The FDA&#8217;s National Center for Toxicological Research has periodically been investigating the effect of long term exposure to AHAs since 2003. On December 31, 2003, the FDA published a call for data on certain ingredients in various products, including AHAs that are part of wrinkle remover products. Manufacturers were asked to submit any data supporting the reclassification of these cosmetic products as over-the-counter drugs. In January 2005, the FDA issued final guidance to the effect that products containing AHAs should alert users that those products may increase skin sensitivity to sun and possible sunburn and the steps to avoid such consequences. On March 20, 2014, the FDA published a set of Q&#38;As that dealt with both long term exposure and drug/cosmetic issues. 

In the 2014 Q&#38;As, the FDA restated its traditional position that certain AHA products intended for therapeutic use, such as acne treatments or skin lighteners, are considered drugs. However, the FDA also confirmed that other AHA products, including those marketed by us, are considered cosmetics and therefore are not subject to more stringent regulations applicable to drugs. The Q&#38;A also reported on the results of two studies on the issue of skin damage caused by UV rays, and the potential photocarcinogenicity of AHA products. The studies concluded that applying AHA products to the skin resulted in increasing UV sensitivity, but that the effect was completely reversible. In addition another study on potential photocarcinogenesis found that AHA products had no effect on the process. Accordingly, we believe we are appropriately marketing our products as cosmetics, and our labeling fully complies with the FDA&#8217;s guidance. 

Our advertising is subject to regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations, which prohibit false and misleading claims in advertising. We believe that all of our labeling and promotional materials comply with these regulations. 

Employees 

We employ 67 people of which 25 full-time and two part-time work in plant and production related functions and 38 work in administrative, sales and advertising functions. No contracts exist between us and any union. We monitor wage and salary rates in the Rocky Mountain area and pursue a policy of providing competitive compensation to our employees. The compensation of our executive officers is subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional benefits that we provide for our employees include medical, vision and dental plans, short-term disability, life insurance, a 401(k) plan with matching contributions for employees earning $50,000 or less per annum and an employee stock ownership (ESOP) plan. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.

Patents and Trademarks 

At present, we own one patent for our Neoteric Diabetic &#174; Healing Cream. Additionally, we actively use our registered trademarks for Scott&#8217;s Liquid Gold &#174; , Touch of Scent &#174; , Alpha Hydrox &#174; and Neoteric &#174; in the United States and have registered trademarks in a number of additional countries. Our registered trademarks protect names and logos relating to our products as well as the design of boxes for certain of our products. 

During 2015 and 2014, our expenditures for research and development were insignificant.
