Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.

&#160;

Power and Electromechanical Segment 

CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, and CUI-Canada - Subsidiaries 

CUI, Inc., is based in Tualatin, Oregon, CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan and CUI-Canada, acquired in March 2015, is based in Toronto, Canada (collectively referred to as &#8220;CUI&#8221;). These three subsidiaries are providers of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service. CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.

&#160;

The Power and Electromechanical Segment aggregates its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions, which includes among other power products, the Novum Digital Power Modules. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense.

&#160;

Power Supply Units 

Our current power line consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules. This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue and recent revenue growth.

&#160; 

Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc . 

The company entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One&#8217;s Digital Power Technology patents.

&#160;

Advanced Power 

With the rapid rise in cloud computing and the &#8220;Internet of Things,&#8221; CUI is well positioned with our advanced power portfolio to address these quickly-growing markets. System complexity, energy efficiency regulations and the need for more processing power in smaller spaces has moved digital power to a mandatory technology in datacom, server and storage applications. As one of the early adopters of digital power, CUI continues to be an industry leader in this space. With the recent release of the NDM3Z 90A POL module, CUI set a benchmark for power output in a point-of-load (POL) module, addressing the needs of the most advanced ICs on the market. As a founding member of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) Group&#174; power consortium partnered with Ericsson Power Modules and Murata, CUI is driving change in the industry to ensure supply chain security and push technology innovation for tomorrow&#8217;s applications. The acquisition of certain assets of Tectrol, Inc. (now CUI Canada) in 2015 now allows us to address the front-end power requirements of these same systems, providing a complete power solution for our customers. In an environment where OEMs are working to reduce their approved vendor list, the capability to deliver a full system solution is becoming critical.

&#160; 

During 2014, CUI, Ericsson Power Modules and Murata announced the formation of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) consortium. The goal of the AMP alliance is to realize the most technically advanced, end-to-end solutions and provide a complete ecosystem of hardware, software and support. Beyond purely mechanical specifications, it is the standardization of monitoring, control and communications functions, and the creation of common configuration files for plug-and-play interoperability that will ensure compatibility between each firms&#8217; products.

&#160; 

As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.

&#160;

Components 

AMT &#174; Encoder

&#160;

Energy Segment 

Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. - Subsidiaries 

Effective April 1, 2013, CUI Global closed on a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (&#8216;&#8216;Orbital&#8217;&#8217;), from Orbital&#8217;s sole shareholder. In 2015, the Company started up a North America subsidiary to its Orbital business.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Orbital is the largest natural gas systems integrator in the U.K. and has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 25 years. In addition, Orbital is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the U.K. and one of the most respected specialized gas engineering companies in the world. Orbital has developed its portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries. Moreover, its proprietary VE &#174; Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT &#174; Technology.

&#160;

GasPT &#174; 

Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV-GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.)(&#8216;&#8216;GL&#8217;&#8217;), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT. The Company has minimum commitments under this licensing contract.

&#160;

The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT, is a low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z). An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.

&#160;

This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil &#38; Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US and NMi &#38; The International Organization of Legal Metrology (&#8216;&#8216;OIML&#8217;&#8217;) for SNAM RETE in Italy. At present, there is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs (&#8216;&#8216;GC&#8217;&#8217;), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the price of the GasPT.

&#160;

By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system. Those injection points will continue to use GC&#8217;s for monitoring. On the other hand, there are 2,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers. Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others. All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.

&#160;

In addition, there are currently 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide. Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality. Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPTi Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with much cleaner emissions. Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC&#8217;s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished. It is this greater efficiency that has lead National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, cancelling orders for several GC&#8217;s and, in October 2013, replacing those GC&#8217;s with an order for eight (8) GasPTi devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In conjunction with the Orbital acquisition, we have moved the entire GasPT technology portfolio, along with the VE-Probe, into Orbital&#8217;s product division, Orbital Global Solutions (Orbital-GS). Orbital-GS has successfully introduced the combined GasPT unit and VE-Probe to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK. In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013.

&#160;

In January 2012 the company entered into a five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a. for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia. SOCRATE is the &#8216;&#8216;vendor-of-choice&#8217;&#8217; for SNAM RETE GAS (&#8216;&#8216;SRG&#8217;&#8217;) and was referred to the company by SRG. SOCRATE continues to be involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan. In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system has concluded 24 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.

&#160;

On September 3, 2015, SRG issued a public tender for the installation of a minimum of 3,300 metering devices to change the way SRG monitors its facilities and assets. After a several month bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) pursuant to the tender.

&#160;

Following the acquisition of Orbital and the transfer of gas operations to Orbital-GS, the company has entered into a series of 42 Distribution Agreements with internationally recognized entities in the natural gas industry. These agreements are designed to supplement and enhance our previously announced and continuing agreements with BENCHMARK, IVES EQUIPMENT, SOCRATE and others.

&#160;

VE-Probe and VE Technology 

On July 30, 2013 our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd. The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems. The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture. By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE-Probe, which is able to provide a gas sample from a high pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.

&#160;

The GasPTi system is able to accurately provide almost real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds. Moreover, it provides this real-time analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.

&#160;

This VE Technology acquisition gives us the ability to control and produce the entire Bill of Materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a far larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry. Additionally, we can now also manufacture, market and sell additional applications for the VE Technology , including sampling systems separate from the GasPT and Thermowells found throughout all pipeline systems.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the VE Technology , in combination with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H&#8322;0), and hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements. That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.

&#160;

Anticipated Growth Strategy for Our Electromechanical Product Line 

We hope to grow our electromechanical product line through a planned strategy to increase our name recognition as a technology company. Our plan, already in effect, includes:

&#160;

&#183; Developing collaborative relationships with our customers by seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner. &#183; Developing new technologies and expanded manufacturing capabilities as needed. &#183; Growing our global sales and distribution through our primary international distribution channel, a prominent international sales and distribution strategic partner that ships product to more than 170 countries worldwide from a single location in the United States. &#183; Directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributor with partnership marketing. &#183; Attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products. Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows. &#160;

These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers&#8217; needs and develop products accordingly. We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing. Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth. We intend to expand according to our existing model. The expansion means more manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States. We intend to eventually have field application engineers in the strategic areas driving designs at the customers&#8217; facility.

&#160;

Anticipated Growth Strategy for GasPT &#174; 

We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device. Our strategy for GasPT has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales. Our &#8216;sale or return&#8217; sales approach has been accepted very positively in Europe and the United States. For the past three years, this approach focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States and the Company will continue its efforts in those areas as well as begin the process in the Asian markets, with India identified as the test market. Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., the largest specialty gas engineering company in England, introduced the combined GasPT unit and V-Probe to National Grid, the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK. We entered into a second five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.

&#160;

According to the latest industry analysts (including MarketsandMarkets ), the global GC market reached $2,583.6 million in 2014 and is poised to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2014 to 2019, reaching $3,605.1 million by 2019. Admittedly, that market is mature and is dominated by &#8216;&#8216;aftermarket and accessories&#8217;&#8217; sales. In contrast, the GasPT Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC. It provides almost real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration. Taking all of those factors into account, it is our intention that the GasPT Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $2.5+ billion market.

&#160;

Acquisition Strategy: 

We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in the form of innovative technology and potential strategic partners. In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, most especially in the power industry, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies. These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including GasPT, and Novum. Moreover, much like when we acquired CUI, Inc., there are many small, well-run electronics companies that become available for multiple reasons. We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies with our current business, along with the potential for increasing revenue and/or market share.

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities 

Research and development costs for CUI Global were approximately $1.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally. The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE Probe technologies. The Company expects that research and development expenses will continue during 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 352 employees. As of December 31, 2015, 78 of its employees in Canada are represented by a labor union. The increase in the number of employees compared to the 200 reported as of December 31, 2014 is primarily a result of the 2015 CUI Canada acquisition and the 2015 startup of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd., North America. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company plans to add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.

Intellectual Property License Evolution 

AMT &#174; encoder technology : 

Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained the relationship with the holder of the AMT encoder technology. Through an exclusive licensing contract with AnderMotion Technologies, LLC, signed on or about April 20, 2009, CUI acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute motion control devices utilizing the AMT encoder technology.

&#160;

Novum &#174; Digital POL technology 

Through a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Power-One, Inc., signed on or about September 18, 2009, CUI has access to Power-One&#8217;s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into CUI&#8217;s new line of digital point of load (POL) power modules.

&#160; 

GasPT &#174; technology 

Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., signed on or about January 4, 2010, CUI Global acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis.

&#160;

VE-Probe and VE Technology 

On July 30, 2013 our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd. The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.

&#160;

Intellectual Property Protection 

The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services. These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners. The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.

&#160;

Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, which maintains the International Register, and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we actively maintain up to date the following trademarks: CUI INC, CUI Europe, V-Infinity, AMT, Novum, CUI Global, Simple Digital, GasPT, IRIS, Vergence and Orbital Gas Systems.

&#160;

The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up to date protection of its intellectual property.

&#160;

For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company&#8217;s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.

&#160;

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions 

The industries in which the company competes are very broad. We operate a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitive pricing to differentiate our products from competitors. The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of larger global firms. We feel that our electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad. We have a very strong retail distribution partner that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers. We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors. This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a $700 encoder &#8211; all different products for different customers. Additionally, we utilize third party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new and better customers otherwise not readily available to the company.

&#160;

CUI is becoming more recognized in the power supply market and has differentiated itself through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality. As of December 31, 2015, our power and electromechanical segment accounted for approximately 67.5% of our revenues and our Energy segment accounted for approximately 32.5% of our revenues. We have added new products and technologies that will provide us the opportunity to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.

&#160;

From our portfolio of full-featured digital point-of-load dc-dc converters, to our line of Platinum-rated front-end power supplies, we believe that we are ahead of the market leaders in our space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas. With the shift toward digitally-based power supplies accelerating, our strategy is to develop a true software defined power ecosystem where the sum of the components is greater than its parts.

&#160;

Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE-Probe, competes in a mature industry with established competitors. There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure. Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z). This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy. At present, there is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as double the price of the GasPT system.

&#160;

Philanthropic Philosophy 

In an industry first, CUI has chosen that, in addition to sales commission, sales representative firms will also receive a charity commission to be donated to charities of their choice. One of CUI&#8217;s core values is generosity, which includes philanthropic giving. We give in our local community and we want to also give in the communities in which we do business.
