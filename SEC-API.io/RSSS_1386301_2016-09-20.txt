&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

Research Solutions is a publicly traded holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries at June 30, 2016: Reprints Desk, Inc., a Delaware corporation and Reprints Desk Latin America S. de R.L. de C.V, an entity organized under the laws of Mexico. Research Solutions was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2006. On March 4, 2013, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Research Solutions, Inc. (formerly Derycz Scientific, Inc.).

&#160;

On August 18, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the immediate disposal of our former subsidiary Techniques Appliqu&#233;es aux Arts Graphiques, S.p.A. (&#8220;TAAG&#8221;), an entity organized under the laws of France, at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and in the event such sale was not consummated by September 10, 2014, that management proceed with an insolvency filing by TAAG under French law. On September 15, 2014, the French Tribunal de Commerce appointed an Administrator for TAAG following a declaration of insolvency by our legal representative, and on October 6, 2014 TAAG entered into a judicial liquidation procedure. As a result, effective September 15, 2014, we relinquished control of TAAG to the Tribunal and TAAG ceased to be our subsidiary and was deconsolidated from our financial statements. 

&#160;

We derecognized the assets, liabilities and other comprehensive income of TAAG with a resulting non-cash gain on deconsolidation of $1,711,748 recorded on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015. In addition, comparative information for prior periods have been restated to segregate the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and cash flows related to TAAG as discontinued operations. We have determined based on discussions with French counsel that it is remote that we will be liable for the unsatisfied liabilities of TAAG as a result of the insolvency process in France, and as a result, we have eliminated any respective liability as of June 30, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; We provide a cloud based software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) research intelligence platform that allows on-demand access to scientific, technical, and medical (&#8220;STM&#8221;) information for life science companies, academic institutions, and other research-intensive organizations. We provide three service offerings to our customers: Article Galaxy SaaS Platforms, Article Galaxy Transactions, and Reprints and ePrints.

&#160;

Article Galaxy SaaS Platforms 

&#160;

Article Galaxy is our cloud-based SaaS solution (&#8220;Article Galaxy&#8221;), which consists of proprietary software and Internet-based interfaces that allow customers to initiate orders, manage transactions, obtain reporting, automate authentication, improve seamless connectivity to corporate intranets, and enhance the information resources they already own, or have access to via subscriptions or internal libraries, as well as organize workgroups to collaborate around scientific and technical information.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a cloud-based SaaS solution, Article Galaxy is deployed as a single system across our entire customer base. Customers access Article Galaxy securely through online web interfaces and via web service APIs, which enable customers to leverage Article Galaxy features and functionality from within proprietary and other 3rd party software systems. Article Galaxy can also be configured to satisfy a customer&#8217;s individual preferences in areas such as user experience, business processes, and spend management. As a SaaS solution, Article Galaxy benefits from efficiencies in scalability, stability and development costs, resulting in significant advantages versus multiple instance or installed desktop software alternatives. We leverage these technical efficiencies to fuel rapid innovation and competitive advantage. We are continually improving the functionality of the platform to further differentiate it from potential competition.

&#160;

Article Galaxy Transactions 

&#160;

Article Galaxy provides our customers with a single source to the universe of published STM content without the limitations of a fixed catalog, and includes over seventy million existing STM articles and over one million newly published STM articles each year. Article Galaxy allows customers to find and download in digital format STM articles that are critical to their research. In addition, Article Galaxy facilitates customers&#8217; compliance with applicable copyright laws.

&#160;

Researchers and regulatory personnel in life science and other research-intensive organizations generally require single copies of published STM journal articles for use in their research activities. They place orders with us for the articles they need and we source and electronically deliver the requested content to them generally in under an hour. This service is known in the industry as single article delivery or &#8220;document delivery&#8221;. We also obtain the necessary permissions from the content publisher so that our customer&#8217;s use complies with applicable copyright laws. We have arrangements with numerous content publishers that allow us to distribute their content. The majority of these publishers provide us with electronic access to their content, which allows us to electronically deliver single articles to our customers often in a matter of minutes. Even though single article delivery services are charged on a transactional basis, customer order volume tends to be consistent from month to month in part due to consistent orders of larger customers that require the implementation of our services into their work flow, subject to fluctuations due to the addition or loss of customers.

&#160;

Reprints and ePrints 

&#160;

Marketing departments in life science and other research-intensive organizations generally require large quantities of printed copies of published STM journal articles called Medical Reprints or &#8220;Reprints&#8221; that are distributed to physicians and at conferences. We obtain the necessary permissions from the content publisher so that our customer&#8217;s use complies with applicable copyright laws. The majority of content publishers print their content in-house and prohibit others from printing their content; however, when not prohibited by the content publisher, we use third parties to print Reprint orders. Electronic copies, called &#8220;ePrints&#8221;, are also used for distribution through the Internet and other electronic mechanisms. We have developed proprietary ePrint software that increases the efficiency of our customers&#8217; content purchases by transitioning from paper Reprints to electronic ePrints, and by improving compliance with applicable copyright laws and promotional regulations within the life science industry. Reprints and ePrints are charged on a transactional basis and order volume typically fluctuates from month to month based on customer marketing budgets and the existence of STM journal articles that fit customer requirements.

&#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we possess the following competitive strengths:

&#160; 

Services and Technology 

&#160;

We have developed proprietary software, a sophisticated information logistics technology backbone, and Internet-based interfaces that allow customers to initiate orders for accessing full-text research papers 24/7, manage these transactions, obtain reporting, automate authentication, improve seamless connectivity to corporate intranets, and maximize the information resources they already own, or have access to via subscriptions or internal libraries, as well as organize workgroups to collaborate around STM information. Our systems integrate into our customers&#8217; corporate intranets and workflows through the Internet, web services and other integration mechanisms. Our services alleviate the need for our customers to develop internal systems or contact multiple content publishers in order to obtain the content that is critical to their research.

&#160;

Our services are highly configurable to meet customers&#8217; needs and provide a personalized yet turnkey solution that covers the full spectrum of customer requirements; from identifying and locating articles, to facilitating copyright compliance, maximizing information resources already owned, monitoring, tracking usage, and automating end-user authentication. We continually enhance the performance of our existing proprietary software and systems and develop and implement new technologies that expand the available methods of discovering, obtaining and managing content. Although we are developing Article Galaxy into a next generation research intelligence SaaS platform, our legacy technology functionality and single article delivery services will be one of many integrated offerings within the new SaaS platform.

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Experienced Management Team 

&#160;

Our management team has well over 100 years of experience satisfying customers across the information services and STM publishing and technology industries. Further, our CEO Peter Derycz has been an innovator in the space for more than 20 years.

&#160; 

Customer Loyalty 

&#160;

The majority of our revenue comes from our loyal base of repeat customers, indicative of our focus on customer satisfaction and quality. The most recent buyer survey performed by Outsell, an industry research and advisory firm, ranked Reprints Desk first overall and in every category: in customer satisfaction (depth and breadth of coverage, fair pricing, and ease of doing business) and loyalty (intention to renew or continue service, and willingness to recommend the service to others).

&#160; 

Industry Presence and Established Relationships 

&#160;

We have a well-established presence and a network of contacts with our customers, STM publishing partners, and others in the information services space. We have existing arrangements with numerous content publishers that allow us to distribute their content.

&#160; 

Promotion 

&#160;

We employ a segment-focus marketing approach to challenge existing competition. In pursuit of growth, we invest in vertical integration and channel relationships to increase the value we provide to customers, extend our promotional reach, and decrease customer acquisition costs. We anticipate growth coming from cross-selling into our existing customer base, penetrating new market verticals, and generating market demand and preference from both existing and new customers. While we place emphasis on the life science market, with a focus on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device customers, we are also penetrating the following new markets: legal, academic, aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, electronics, chemicals and food and agriculture.

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Organic Growth 

&#160;

We seek to grow our customer base through targeted direct and channel promotions of the most current version of the Article Galaxy platform to potential customers. This strategy for sales and marketing is supported by innovative technological systems, competitive pricing and high quality service. We are also positioning our sales force to be able to better serve small and medium sized businesses that we consider to be largely underserved today. &#160; 

&#160;

We also submit proposals to potential customers in response to requests for proposals, or &#8220;Request for Proposals&#8221; (RFPs). We are continually improving our operations and technology to ensure that they are capable of delivering proposed solutions and supporting future growth.

&#160;

Acquisitions and Combinations 

&#160;

From time to time, and as opportunities arise, we may explore strategic acquisitions and combinations, including the acquisition of customer lists, that bring revenue, profitability, growth potential and additional technology, products, services, operations and/or geographic capabilities to our company.

&#160; 

International Expansion 

&#160;

We have expanded internationally through increased sales to companies located abroad, particularly in Europe and Japan. From time to time, and as opportunities arise, we may further expand internationally through partnerships or acquisitions.

&#160; 

Publisher Agreements 

&#160;

We have arrangements with all of the major STM content publishers and most of the smaller STM publishers that allow us to distribute their content, and we regularly advance new business opportunities such as rentals through amendments to existing agreements. In addition, we regularly contact publishers to negotiate additional publisher agreements. A typical publisher agreement would allow us to distribute the publisher&#8217;s content according to a negotiated price list, thereby eliminating the need to contact the publisher and obtain the rights for each individual order. The majority of these publishers provide us with electronic access to their content, which allows us to further expedite the delivery of single articles to our customers. In addition, we rely on a small number of content publishers for the majority of our content costs.

&#160; 

Company Services 

&#160;

We generate revenue by providing three service offerings to our customers: Article Galaxy SaaS Platforms, Article Galaxy Transactions, and Reprints and ePrints.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Article Galaxy SaaS Platforms 

&#160;

We charge a subscription fee that allows customers to access and utilize our Article Galaxy software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) platform. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.

&#160; 

Article Galaxy Transactions 

&#160;

We charge a transactional service fee for the electronic delivery of single articles, and a corresponding copyright fee for the permitted use of the content. This service is known in the industry as single article delivery or document delivery. We recognize revenue from single article delivery services upon delivery to the customer only when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

&#160; 

Reprints and ePrints 

&#160;

We charge a transactional fee for each Reprint or ePrint order and are responsible for printing and delivery of Reprint orders, and the electronic delivery and, in some cases, the electronic delivery mechanism of ePrint orders. The majority of content publishers print their content in-house and prohibit others from printing their content; however, when not prohibited by the content publisher, we use third parties to print Reprint orders. We recognize revenue from reprints and ePrints services upon shipment or electronic delivery to the customer only when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

&#160;

Customers and Suppliers 

&#160;

There were no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

Approximately 37% and 38% of our content cost for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was derived from our three largest suppliers of content. Loss of any or all of these suppliers of content would significantly reduce our revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that these suppliers of content will continue to supply us with content in the future.

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

To acquire customers, we rely on sales promotion to sell to large enterprise accounts, and marketing communications to more efficiently recruit small-to-medium and geographically-dispersed enterprises. The promotional mix of tactics we utilize includes: advertising, events, direct response and integrated marketing campaigns, public relations and content publicity, search engine optimization and marketing, thought leadership programs, channel alliances training, and analyst relations. In addition, a portion of our marketing budget is dedicated to research and customer retention, which, we believe, increases total lifetime value per account and generates significant amounts of referrals for new business

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. The primary methods of competition in our industry are price, service, technology and niche focus. Competition based on price is often successful in the short-term, but can limit the ability of a supplier to provide adequate service levels. Competition based on service and/or technology requires significant investment in systems and that investment requires time to produce results. Niche operators focus on narrow activities, but cannot aggregate sufficient content, technology and services to satisfy broad customer needs. We believe that many customers and potential customers are less price sensitive if the service levels are high and the technology creates efficiency and/or management information that has not been available previously.

&#160;

Our competition includes:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Piracy - Perhaps, our most serious competitor. Many entities use content for commercial purposes without complying with applicable copyright laws, and paying the required copyright to the content publisher. As information becomes more readily available, the opportunity for piracy increases.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; STM Single Article Delivery Vendors and Content Aggregators - Our primary competitors for global, full-service Single Article Delivery services are Copyright Clearance Center, regional interlibrary loan networks throughout the world such as those owned and operated by OCLC, and numerous national libraries located outside of the United States.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Reference Management Applications &#8211; We expect to increasingly compete with tools that exist in the marketplace that are used to aid in organizing references, storing personal content assets, and prepare scholarly papers for submission to journals for publication.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Customer In-House Services - While Single Article Delivery services are more challenging than Reprint services for our customers to provide in house, many existing and potential customers manage these services internally. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Publisher In-House Capabilities - Some large publishers have developed in-house capabilities to service the content re-use market, however, many of them neglect other content repurposing opportunities and may not be able to aggregate content from other publishers. 

&#160;

Corporate History and Structure 

&#160;

Research Solutions was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2006, and in November 2006 entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Reprints Desk. At the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, Research Solutions acquired all of the outstanding shares of Reprints Desk from its stockholders and issued 8,000,003 shares of common stock to the former stockholders of Reprints Desk. Following completion of the exchange transaction, Reprints Desk became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Research Solutions. Reprints Desk provides Article Galaxy and Reprint and ePrint services.

&#160;

On July 24, 2012, we formed Reprints Desk Latin America to provide operational and administrative support services to Reprints Desk.

&#160;

On March 4, 2013, we consummated a merger with DYSC Subsidiary Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which we, in connection with such merger, amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Research Solutions, Inc. (formerly Derycz Scientific, Inc.).

&#160;

On February 28, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Pools Press, Inc., an Illinois corporation (&#8220;Pools&#8221;), pursuant to which we acquired 75% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Pools for consideration of $616,080. We purchased the remaining interest in Pools that we did not already own on August 31, 2010. The results of Pools&#8217; operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since March 1, 2007. On January 1, 2012, Pools merged with and into Reprints Desk. Pools provided printing services, specializing in reprints, until operations were discontinued in June 2013.

&#160;

On March 31, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Fimmotaag, S.p.A. (&#8220;Fimmotaag&#8221;), a privately held company domiciled in France, pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of TAAG in exchange for 336,921 shares of our common stock in addition to future payments payable at the option of Fimmotaag in cash or our common stock under the terms of the purchase agreement. On March 28, 2013, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Fimmotaag and its two principal owners (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Fimmotaag agreed to return 336,921 shares of our common stock to us and to forego future payments payable to Fimmotaag by us pursuant to the terms of the agreement under which we acquired TAAG from Fimmotaag. 

&#160;

On August 18, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the immediate disposal of our former subsidiary TAAG at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and in the event such sale was not consummated by September 10, 2014, that management proceed with an insolvency filing by TAAG under French law. On September 15, 2014, the French Tribunal de Commerce appointed an Administrator for TAAG following a declaration of insolvency by our legal representative, and on October 6, 2014 TAAG entered into a judicial liquidation procedure. As a result, effective September 15, 2014, we relinquished control of TAAG to the Tribunal and TAAG ceased to be our subsidiary and was deconsolidated from our financial statements. 

&#160;

In accordance with consolidation guidance we derecognized the assets, liabilities and other comprehensive income of TAAG with a resulting non-cash gain on deconsolidation of $1,711,748 recorded on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015. In addition, comparative information for prior periods have been restated to segregate the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and cash flows related to TAAG as discontinued operations. We have determined based on discussions with French counsel that it is remote that we will be liable for the unsatisfied liabilities of TAAG as a result of the insolvency process in France, and as a result, we have eliminated any respective liability as of June 30, 2015.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 16, 2016, we had 117 full time employees and 3 part-time employees.
