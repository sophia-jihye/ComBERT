In addition, U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;U.S. Global&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. Forward-looking statements include statements as to industry trends, future expectations of the Company, and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts and are based on certain assumptions by management. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; or &#8220;continue,&#8221; and similar expressions or variations. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Company management based on information currently available to management. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this report and other documents filed or furnished by U.S. Global from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). U.S. Global cautions readers to carefully consider such factors. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. Except to the extent required by applicable law, U.S. Global undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

U.S. Global, a Texas corporation organized in 1968, is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (&#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;). The Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages three business segments:

&#160;

1.

Investment Management Services, through which the Company offers, through U.S. Global Investors Funds (&#8220;USGIF&#8221; or the &#8220;Fund(s)&#8221;), offshore clients, and an exchange traded fund (&#8220;ETF&#8221;) client, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors;

2.

Investment Management Services - Canada, through which, as of June 1, 2014, the Company owns a 65% controlling interest in Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. (&#8220;Galileo&#8221;), a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm which offers investment management products and services in Canada; and

3.

Corporate Investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position. Although the Company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segments, the Company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments.

As part of its investment management businesses, the Company provides: (1) investment advisory services and (2) administrative services to the mutual funds advised by the Company. The fees from these services, as well as investment income, are the primary sources of the Company&#8217;s revenue. The Company also provided transfer agency services through December 2013 and distribution services through December 2015 to USGIF.

Lines of Business

Investment Management Services

Investment Advisory Services. &#160; The Company furnishes an investment program for each of the clients it manages and determines, subject to overall supervision by the applicable board of trustees of the clients, the clients&#8217; investments pursuant to an advisory agreement. Consistent with the investment restrictions, objectives and policies of the particular client, the portfolio team for each client determines what investments should be purchased, sold, and held, and makes changes in the portfolio deemed necessary or appropriate. In the advisory agreement, the Company is charged with seeking the best overall terms in executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers. 

As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (&#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), the advisory agreement with USGIF is subject to annual renewal and is terminable upon 60-day notice. This agreement has been renewed through September 2017.

In addition to providing advisory services to USGIF, the Company provides advisory services to two offshore clients and one ETF. A third offshore fund liquidated in November 2013.

Net assets under management on June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, are detailed in the following table.

Administrative Services. The Company also manages, supervises and conducts certain other affairs of USGIF, subject to the control of the Funds&#8217; Board of Trustees pursuant to an administrative services agreement. Prior to December &#160; 10, 2015, it provided office space, facilities and certain business equipment as well as the services of executive and clerical personnel for administering the affairs of the Funds. U.S. Global and its affiliates compensated all personnel, officers, directors and interested trustees of the Funds if such persons were also employees of the Company or its affiliates. Effective December 2013, the Funds&#8217; Board of Trustees increased the annual rate from 0.08 percent to 0.10 percent for each investor class and from 0.06 percent to 0.08 percent for each institutional class plus $10,000 per Fund. Effective November &#160; 1, 2014, the annual per fund fee changed to $7,000. Effective December 10, 2015, the Company entered into an amended administrative services agreement with USGIF whereby the Company and a third party act as co-administrators to the Funds. The Company continues to assist with certain administrative tasks. Effective December &#160; 10, 2015, the annual rate changed to 0.05 percent for each investor class and to 0.04 percent for each institutional class, and the per fund fee was eliminated. The administrative services agreement with USGIF is subject to renewal on an annual basis and is terminable upon 60-day notice. This agreement has been renewed through September 2017. 

Distribution Services. Prior to December &#160; 10, 2015 , t he Company provided distribution services to USGIF. In doing so, the Company had registered its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Global Brokerage, Inc. (&#8220;USGB&#8221;), with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the SEC and appropriate state regulatory authorities as a limited-purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of distributing Fund shares. Effective December &#160; 10, 2015, USGB ceased to be the distributor for USGIF. The Company filed Form BDW, the Uniform Request Withdrawal From Broker-Dealer Registration, with FINRA, which was approved in February 2016. Distribution revenues and the expenses associated with certain distribution operations for USGIF are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are, therefore, excluded from continuing operations results.

Shareholder Services. Prior to December &#160; 10, 2015, in connection with obtaining and/or providing administrative services to the beneficial owners of USGIF through broker-dealers, banks, trust companies and similar institutions which provide such services, the Company received shareholder services fees at an annual rate of up to 0.20 percent of the value of shares held in accounts at the institutions, which helped to offset related platform costs. This agreement ceased on December &#160; 10, 2015. Shareholder services revenues and related expenses are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are, therefore, excluded from continuing operations results. 

Transfer Agency and Other Services. Through December 6, 2013, the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, United Shareholder Services, Inc. (&#8220;USSI&#8221;), a transfer agent registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), provided transfer agency, printing, and mailing services to investment company clients. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors formally agreed on August 23, 2013, to exit the transfer agency business so that the Company could focus more on its core strength of investment management. USSI served as transfer agent until conversion to the new transfer agent on December 9, 2013. The transfer agency results, together with expenses associated with discontinuing transfer agency operations, are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are, therefore, excluded from continuing operations results.

1. 

The mutual funds managed by Galileo (&#8220;Galileo Funds&#8221;) are Canadian registered mutual funds and are not available in the United States.

Effective March 31, 2013, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited (&#8220;USCAN&#8221;), purchased 50 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc., a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm, for $600,000 cash.

Effective June 1, 2014, the Company, through USCAN, completed its purchase of an additional 15 percent interest in Galileo from the company&#8217;s founder, Michael Waring, for $180,000 cash. This strategic investment brought USCAN&#8217;s ownership to 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo, which represents controlling interest of Galileo. The non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in &#8220;non-controlling interest in subsidiaries&#8221; in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Frank Holmes, CEO, and Susan McGee, President, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer, serve as directors of Galileo.

Galileo Equity Management Inc. was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on July 16, 1999. On May 17, 2007, its name changed to Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. Galileo is registered as a portfolio manager and exempt market dealer with the Ontario Securities Commission (&#8220;OSC&#8221;), the Nova Scotia Securities Commission and the Quebec Securities Commission. Additionally, the company is registered as an exempt market dealer with the New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador Securities Commissions. On July 31, 2012, Galileo was also registered as an investment fund manager with the OSC.

Corporate Investments

Investment Activities. In addition to providing management and advisory services, the Company is actively engaged in trading for its own account. See segment information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements at Note &#160; 17, Financial Information by Business Segment, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Additional Segment Information

See additional financial information about business segments in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data at Note 17, Financial Information by Business Segment, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees

As of June 30, 2016, U.S. Global and its subsidiaries employed 23 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees; as of June 30, 2015, it employed 40 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

Competition

The mutual fund industry is highly competitive. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2015 there were approximately 9,500 domestically registered open-end investment companies and approximately 1,600 exchange-traded funds of varying sizes and investment policies, whose shares are being offered to the public in the U.S. In addition to competition from other mutual fund managers and investment advisers, the Company and the mutual fund industry are in competition with various investment alternatives offered by insurance companies, banks, securities broker-dealers, and other financial institutions. Many of these institutions are able to engage in more liberal advertising than mutual funds and ETFs and may offer accounts at competitive interest rates, which may be insured by federally chartered corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

A number of mutual fund groups are significantly larger than the funds managed by U.S. Global, offer a greater variety of investment objectives and have more experience and greater resources to promote the sale of investments therein. However, the Company believes it has the resources, products, and personnel to compete with these other mutual funds. In particular, the Company is known for its expertise in the gold mining and exploration, natural resources and emerging markets. Competition for sales of fund shares is influenced by various factors, including investment objectives and performance, advertising and sales promotional efforts, distribution channels, and the types and quality of services offered to fund shareholders.

Success in the investment advisory business is substantially dependent on each fund&#8217;s investment performance, the quality of services provided to shareholders, and the Company&#8217;s efforts to market the Funds effectively. Sales of Fund shares generate management and administrative services fees (which are based on the assets of the Funds). Costs of distribution and compliance continue to put pressure on profit margins for the mutual fund industry.

Despite the Company&#8217;s expertise in gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets, the Company faces the same obstacle many advisers face, namely uncovering undervalued investment opportunities as the markets face further uncertainty and increased volatility. In addition, the growing number of alternative investments, especially in specialized areas, has created pressure on the profit margins and increased competition for available investment opportunities.

Supervision and Regulation

The Company and the clients the Company manages and administers operate under certain laws, including federal and state securities laws, governing their organization, registration, operation, legal, financial, and tax status. Among the potential penalties for violation of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries are fines, imprisonment, injunctions, revocation of registration, and certain additional administrative sanctions. Any determination that the Company or its management has violated applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. Moreover, there is no assurance that changes to existing laws, regulations, or rulings promulgated by governmental entities having jurisdiction over the Company and the Funds will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company has no control over regulatory rulemaking or the consequences it may have on the mutual fund and investment advisory industry.

Recent and accelerating regulatory pronouncements and oversight have significantly increased the burden of compliance infrastructure with respect to the mutual fund industry and the capital markets. This momentum of new regulations has contributed significantly to the costs of managing and administering mutual funds.

U.S. Global is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. As a registered investment adviser, it is subject to the requirements of the Advisers Act, and the SEC&#8217;s regulations thereunder, as well as to examination by the SEC&#8217;s staff. The Advisers Act imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of the Company&#8217;s business and relationships with the Company&#8217;s clients. Applicable rules relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, transactions with clients, effective compliance programs, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements. The Funds and ETF for which the Company acts as the investment adviser are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act imposes additional obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both funds and their advisers. Moreover, an investment adviser&#8217;s contract with a registered fund may be terminated by the fund on not more than 60 days&#8217; notice and is subject to annual renewal by the fund&#8217;s board after an initial two-year term. Both the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act regulate the &#8220;assignment&#8221; of advisory contracts by the investment adviser. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. The failure of the Company, or the Funds and ETF which the Company advises, to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is also subject to federal and state laws affecting corporate governance, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;S-Ox Act&#8221;), as well as rules adopted by the SEC.

USGB was subject to regulation by the SEC under the Exchange Act and regulation by FINRA, a self-regulatory organization composed of other registered broker-dealers. U.S. Global and USGB are required to keep and maintain certain reports and records, which must be made available to the SEC and FINRA upon request.

Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. (&#8220;Galileo&#8221;) is registered as a portfolio manager and investment fund manager with the Ontario Securities Commission (&#8220;OSC&#8221;). As a registered portfolio manager, the OSC imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of Galileo's business and relationships with Galileo&#8217;s clients. Applicable legislation relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, transactions with clients, effective compliance programs, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements. The Canadian funds for which Galileo acts as the investment fund manager are registered with the OSC follow under National Instrument 81-101/102/106. These National Policies impose additional obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both funds and their managers. The OSC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the rules ranging from fines and censures to termination of a portfolio manager and investment fund manager&#8217;s registration. The failure of Galileo, or the Canadian funds which Galileo advises, to comply with the requirements of the OSC could have a material adverse effect on Galileo.

Relationships with Clients

The businesses of the Company are to a very significant degree dependent on their associations and contractual relationships with USGIF. In the event the advisory or administrative agreements with USGIF are canceled or not renewed pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company would be substantially adversely affected. U.S. Global considers its relationships with the Funds to be good, and management has no reason to believe that the management and service contracts will not be renewed in the future; however, there is no assurance that USGIF will choose to continue its relationship with the Company.

In addition, the Company is also dependent on its relationships with its offshore and exchange traded fund clients. Even though the Company views its relationship with its offshore and exchange traded fund clients as stable, the Company could be adversely affected if these relationships ended.

Galileo is also dependent on its relationships with its clients. Even though Galileo views its relationship with its clients as stable, the Company could be adversely affected if these relationships ended.
