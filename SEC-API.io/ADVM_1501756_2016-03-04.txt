 Item 1. Business

Overview

We are a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating disease. We have leveraged our next-generation gene therapy platform to create a pipeline of product candidates. Our product candidates are designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. 

We are targeting diseases with unmet medical need, including ophthalmic diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as rare genetic diseases. We believe that there are several important benefits to focusing on the development of rare genetic diseases including the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

well-known disease pathways which we believe are particularly amenable to gene therapy, especially in conditions that are caused by a defect in expression of a single gene; 

&#160;

&#183; 

gene therapy is believed to offer a versatile protein delivery system with persistent expression; 

&#160;

&#183; 

local delivery of the therapeutic protein; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

significant market demand for therapies that can offer long-term clinical benefit with potentially a one-time administration. 

For ophthalmic diseases, such as wet AMD, there are further benefits including the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

reduced risk of harmful immune responses and systemic side effects due to localized delivery in a self-contained organ; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

well-defined and objective clinical endpoints such as the ability to read an eye chart. 

To date, our primary focus has been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). We generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia, of whom six were randomized to treatment with AVA-101 and two to standard-of-care therapy in the form of ranibizumab injections on an as-needed basis per protocol. Six of these subjects were available for evaluation at 36 months, and of these six subjects, four were treated with AVA-101. In June 2015, we announced the 36-month follow-up data on the six subjects, which confirmed the safety profile of the drug previously reported at 12 months. 

Additionally, we conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI with 32 additional wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study was based on ophthalmic and systemic safety, and secondary endpoints included retinal thickness (which can be a sign of reoccurrence of fluid in the retina), visual acuity and the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the form of rescue injections with ranibizumab. The Phase 2a clinical study met its 12-month primary endpoint, demonstrating that AVA-101 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with wet AMD. No serious adverse events related to AVA-101 were observed. With respect to the secondary endpoints of the Phase 2a study overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we are conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program. 

&#160;

Regeneron had a time-limited right of first negotiation for certain rights to AVA-101 as part of our collaboration. In September 2015, we initiated , by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising this right of first ne gotiation. 

In addition to AVA-101, we are working on other product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

AVA-201. We are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-VEGF protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary, customized delivery mechanism, or vector. As part of the preclinical re-evaluation of our wet AMD program, direct comparisons of AVA-101 and -201 are being carried out, including the potential for the use of AVA-201 for direct treatment of active as well as prevention of wet AMD. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AVA-311. As part of our research collaboration with Regeneron, AVA-311 is being evaluated in preclinical studies for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare genetic disease of the retina with no approved therapy. There are approximately 10,000 boys and young men in the United States suffering from the disease. XLRS is caused by mutation of the RS1 gene and results in splitting of retinal layers and corresponding loss of vision. In preclinical studies in animals to date, AVA-311 has delayed the progression of XLRS and improved vision by delivering functional copies of the RS1 gene in retinal cells of mice. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AVA-322 and AVA-323. We are developing AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency (CVD), commonly known as red-green color blindness. CVD is a highly prevalent genetic disorder that affects approximately 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females, with some variation by race, and is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in the opsin genes that impact the ability of the cone cells to respond to various wavelengths of light in the retina. 

Proposed Transaction with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS

On February 1, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (Annapurna), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing gene therapy for unmet medical needs, providing for the acquisition by us of all outstanding shares of Annapurna in exchange for approximately 13.1 million newly issued shares of our common stock and the conversion of all outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna (the Annapurna Options) into options relating to approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock. The number of newly issued shares and the number of shares that the Annapurna Options relate to are subject to adjustment based on the exercise of the Annapurna Options by their holders prior to the closing of the proposed transaction. Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock to Annapurna&#8217;s shareholders. 

If the proposed transaction with Annapurna is consummated, our pipeline will consist of our existing ophthalmic programs and Annapurna&#8217;s four gene therapy based programs, which are focused on Alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, cardiomyopathy associated with Friedrich&#8217;s ataxia, hereditary angioedema and severe allergies. In addition, if the proposed transaction is consummated, Amber Salzman, Ph.D., the president and chief executive officer of Annapurna, will become our president and chief operating officer, and Carlo Russo, M.D., the chief medical officer and head of development at Annapurna, will serve as our executive vice president and chief medical officer. Furthermore, upon consummation of the transaction, our board of directors will expand to nine directors, comprised of our current directors and four new directors initially designated by Annapurna.

&#160;

Strategy 

Our goal is to transform the lives of patients through the discovery and development of novel medicines that can potentially offer life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating disease. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to build a diverse gene therapy pipeline targeting ophthalmic and rare genetic diseases. If our proposed transaction with Annapurna is completed, our pipeline will consist of our existing ophthalmic programs and Annapurna&#8217;s four gene therapy based programs, which are focused on Alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, cardiomyopathy associated with Friedrich&#8217;s ataxia, hereditary angioedema and severe allergies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to identify and target diseases using our next-generation discovery platform. We are focusing on creating a diverse pipeline targeting diseases that can be better treated by the sustained delivery of a therapeutic protein. We plan to continue to invest in our platform and employ directed evolution to create and manufacture next-generation vectors with higher efficiency and greater specificity that can potentially treat previously untreatable diseases. Our platform will be designed to create second-generation vectors for use in our existing ophthalmic programs and, if the transaction with Annapurna is completed, Annapurna&#8217;s four gene therapy based programs. We plan to continue to identify additional appropriate target indications by leveraging our internal expertise and relationships with thought leaders. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to advance wet AMD and CVD programs and work with Regeneron on collaboration projects. We are conducting additional preclinical studies on AVA-101 and AVA-201 to inform further development of our wet AMD program. We will also continue to develop AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency. As part of our research collaboration with Regeneron, we will continue to evaluate AVA-311 in on-going preclinical studies for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We plan to develop and commercialize multiple product candidates independently. For targets outside our core area of interest or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate additional collaborations with strategic partners. 

Gene Therapy Background

Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality to address disease biology in a targeted and efficient way. Using gene therapy, physicians can introduce or re-introduce genes that encode a therapeutic protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once or a very limited number of times to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Once a patient&#8217;s cells have incorporated the therapeutic gene, the cells are able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years or, potentially, the rest of the patient&#8217;s life.

Similar to existing classes of protein or biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates, gene therapy has taken a number of years to evolve from a research tool into a viable and compelling treatment modality. There have been several recent advances in gene therapy, including the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Clinical data. Positive data from gene therapy have been reported in a variety of indications, including adrenoleukodystrophy, beta-thalassemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, hemophilia, HIV and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, as well as several ophthalmic diseases including LCA2, Choroideremia and Leber&#8217;s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased investment by biopharmaceutical companies. The modality of gene therapy has been further validated by growing interest and investments by biopharmaceutical companies. Large, global biopharmaceutical companies, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis, Sanofi, Regeneron and Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc, have increased their investment in the gene therapy field. Additionally, pure-play gene therapy companies, such as Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, bluebird bio, Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Sangamo BioSciences, Inc., uniQure N.V. and Voyager Therapeutics, have attracted recent investment in this growing field. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Regulatory clarity. Although the FDA has not yet approved a gene therapy product, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. 

&#160;

&#183; 

First product approval. In 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted approval for Glybera&#174; (developed by uniQure) for the orphan disease lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Glybera is the first gene therapy product approved in the Western world. 

&#160;

Our Novel AAV Vector Discovery and Optimization System 

Our next-generation discovery platform is based on vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is a small, non-pathogenic virus, with the DNA encoding the AAV viral genes removed and replaced with a therapeutic gene to treat a disease. The resulting vector is used to deliver a functional gene into a desired cell population, which when expressed, will result in continuous protein production. We believe AAV vectors offer numerous advantages over other viral and non-viral vector technologies used for gene therapy. These advantages, highlighted below, have the potential to allow AAVs to be safe, to be applicable for a variety of indications and to exhibit long-term efficacy.

&#160;

&#183; 

Non-pathogenic. AAV vectors are not known to cause any disease in humans. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Low immunogenicity. AAV vectors elicit only a mild immune response, if any, in humans, particularly when used in the eye. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Non-replicating. Once inside the host cell, AAV vectors do not replicate, thereby preventing the spread to unwanted tissues. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Non-integrating. AAV vectors do not readily integrate into the host cell&#8217;s genome, mitigating the risk of potential safety concerns. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to transduce non-dividing cells. AAV vectors are able to transduce non-dividing cells and this is a significant advantage as many retinal cells cease to divide early in a person&#8217;s life. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Long-term expression. Once incorporated into the host cell, AAV vectors can continue to drive expression of a therapeutic protein for years. 

AAV is naturally occurring and has become a leading vector used in gene therapy. According to the Journal of Gene Medicine , AAV has been used in over 130 clinical trials as of January 2015 demonstrating the increasing acceptance of gene therapy as a safe and effective method for delivering therapeutic genes of interest. The most frequently studied variant of AAV is AAV2, which can preferentially infect a number of cell types, including those found in the retina. 

As effective as existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there is an opportunity to advance vector capabilities beyond those currently available. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which pose limitations to their use in gene therapy. 

In order to create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. These vectors are designed to penetrate a specific cell type within the retina with high efficiency and transduce cells to express a therapeutic protein over a long duration.

Our directed evolution technology uses a library of genes coding for viral proteins found in a number of naturally occurring AAVs. We modify these genes in the laboratory to derive novel combinations of genes that produce vectors exhibiting different properties and capabilities. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, each with distinct genetic and chemical composition, we screen the AAVs in the pool for novel properties, e.g., specific transduction of a particular cell type of interest or the capability to evade pre-existing neutralizing immune response. After identifying a smaller pool of optimized vectors from this screening process, we repeat the steps of diversity generation and screening until we have identified a select number of engineered AAVs with the characteristics we seek. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Product Candidates

We have developed a pipeline of proprietary and partnered programs across both major markets and rare diseases in the field of ophthalmology. 

AVA-101 and AVA-201 for Treatment of Wet AMD

AMD is a progressive disease affecting the retinal cells in the macula, the region of the eye responsible for central vision. Disease progression results in the death of retinal cells and the gradual loss of vision. As people age, the likelihood of disease progression increases and the resulting condition is referred to as AMD. 

Approximately 10% of total cases of AMD represent an advanced form of the disease called wet AMD, in which blood vessels begin to invade the cellular space between layers of cells in the retina. These new blood vessels are often leaky, which results in fluid and blood in the retina and causes vision loss. Wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss with a prevalence of approximately three million people worldwide. The incidence of new cases of wet AMD in the United States is approximately 150,000 to 200,000 a year and this number is expected to grow significantly based on the aging of the population.

While the underlying molecular causes of AMD are not completely known, VEGF is known to play a central role in the growth of new blood vessels in wet AMD. The standard-of-care therapies for wet AMD include Lucentis&#174; and EYLEA&#174;, as well as off-label use of Avastin&#174;. Lucentis&#174;, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to and inhibits VEGF proteins in the eye, was approved in the United States in 2006 and in Europe in 2007. In 2014, Lucentis&#174; achieved worldwide sales of approximately $4.2 billion. EYLEA&#174;, a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the human VEGF receptor that binds to VEGF, was approved in the United States in 2011. EYLEA&#174; has exhibited strong adoption in the market due to its more convenient dosing regimen compared to Lucentis and in 2015, EYLEA&#174; achieved worldwide sales of approximately $4.1 billion. Avastin&#174; is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF and is approved as an anti-cancer agent. Avastin&#174; is widely prescribed off-label in ophthalmic diseases such as wet AMD and makes up approximately 60% of the wet AMD market by volume, but is insignificant in terms of revenue. 

To date, our primary focus has been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). We generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase I trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia, of whom six were randomized to treatment with AVA-101 and two to standard-of-care therapy in the form of ranibizumab injections on an as-needed basis per protocol. Six of these subjects were available for evaluation at 36 months, and of these six subjects, four were treated with AVA-101. In June 2015, we announced the 36-month follow-up data on the six subjects, which confirmed the safety profile of the drug previously reported at 12 months. 

Additionally, we conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI with 32 additional wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study was based on ophthalmic and systemic safety, and secondary endpoints included retinal thickness (which can be a sign of reoccurrence of fluid in the retina), visual acuity and the need for anti- VEGF therapy in the form of rescue injections with ranibizumab. The Phase 2a clinical study met its 12-month primary endpoint, demonstrating that AVA-101 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in subjects with wet AMD. No serious adverse events related to AVA-101 were observed. With respect to the secondary endpoints of the Phase 2a study, overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we are conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program.

In addition to AVA-101, we are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-VEGF protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary, customized delivery mechanism, or vector. As part of our preclinical re-evaluation of our wet AMD program, direct comparisons of AVA-101 and -201 are being carried out, including the potential for the use of AVA-201 for direct treatment of active as well as prevention of wet AMD.

&#160;

AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the Treatment of Color Vision Deficiency

&#160;

Color vision deficiency (CVD) is commonly known as red-green color blindness. CVD is a highly prevalent genetic disorder that affects approximately 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females, with some variation by race, and is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in the opsin genes that impact the ability of the cone cells to respond to various wavelengths of light in the retina. 

&#160;

&#160;

We are developing AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of CVD. AVA-322 and AVA-323 each comprises an optimized AAV vector that intravitreally delivers the L-Opsin or M-Opsin gene in the eye for the treatment of protan or deutan defects. 

AVA-311 for the Treatment of Juvenile X-linked Retinoschisis

XLRS is an inherited retinal disease that occurs almost exclusively in males. It is caused by mutations in the RS1 gene located on the X chromosome. The RS1 protein binds to the surface of the photoreceptors and biopolar cells in the retina and is crucial in maintaining the tissue&#8217;s integrity. Disruption in the production of the RS1 protein may cause schisis, or splitting, of the retinal layers or leakage in the blood vessels of the retina. These complications lead to severe vision impairment or blindness and often manifest early in childhood. We believe that approximately 10,000 boys and young men suffer from XLRS.

As part of our Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron, AVA-311 is being developed for the potential treatment of XLRS, a genetic disease affecting boys and young men with no approved therapy. AVA-311 is comprised of an optimized AAV vector that intravitreally delivers the RS1 gene in the eye to potentially achieve a functional cure for patients. Under our Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron, if it exercises its option, Regeneron will be responsible for all preclinical studies and clinical trials for AVA-311, and will retain worldwide commercialization rights. We have the option to share up to 35% of the development costs and profits from this product candidate.

Manufacturing

We produce our AAVs using a proprietary manufacturing process based on insect cells and baculoviruses, a common family of viruses found in invertebrates. Our process is based on the Baculovirus Expression System (BVES), which has been used in a number of FDA- and EMA-approved products. This approach is well suited for the production of large quantities of AAVs, as it takes advantage of efficiency of viral infection coupled with the high density and scalability of insect cells grown in serum-free suspension cultures. Compared to the mammalian cell-based approaches commonly used in the field, our manufacturing process is designed to produce higher yields of vectors in a cost-effective manner.

Our BVES manufacturing process is presented in the figure below.

&#160;

1) 

The process begins with two DNA constructs, one encoding the therapeutic protein and the other encoding AAV helper components encoding the AAV capsid and for replication of vectors.

&#160;

2) 

Each DNA construct is inserted into the genome of a baculorvirus to create two types of recombinant baculoviruses.

&#160;

3) 

The two baculoviruses are used to transduce insect cells, which in turn produce large amounts of AAV vectors containing the therapeutic gene of interest.

&#160;

4) 

The transduced cells are then harvested and treated with a lysis buffer solution to burst the insect cells and release the AAV vectors.

&#160;

5) 

AAV vectors are then purified to remove unwanted debris.

&#160;

6) 

Following purification, the vectors are formulated in a physiological solution and placed in vials.

&#160;

7) 

The resulting drug product is ready for use as a therapeutic treatment for the targeted disease.

&#160;

BVES Manufacturing Process 

Our AAV manufacturing method is industrialized, highly scalable and ready for adaptation for commercial stage. We believe our process provides the following advantages over competing systems:

&#160;

&#183; 

Industrial-scale biologics production. Our BVES system can produce commercial quantities by incorporating scalable, well-established process steps used throughout the industry for biologic products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Safety advantages. Our BVES system does not use mammalian cell cultures or tumorigenic cell lines, and the DNA sequences used to allow AAV vector production are inactive in mammalian cells, which lowers the risk of off-target expression from our products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

High yield and low cost. Our BVES system produces a high number of particles per cell, producing many thousand doses per manufacturing run. The yields are up to one hundred times greater than those obtained using conventional AAV production systems. This lowers the unit cost of goods, allowing us to meet global demand for large markets, such as wet AMD. 

&#160;

&#183; 

High purity. Our BVES system produces a highly pure drug substance, which reduces the presence of unwanted contaminants in the final product. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Precedent regulatory framework. Our BVES system is used for several FDA- and EMA-approved vaccines and gene therapy products including FluBlok &#174;, Cervarix &#174; and Glybera. 

We have entered into a manufacturing technology license agreement pursuant to which we and Lonza Houston, Inc. are assessing certain technology potentially useful for the manufacture of our products. The license agreement provides that the parties will conduct activities to evaluate such technology and that we may elect to engage Lonza to manufacture our products. We also granted to Lonza certain licenses to practice the manufacturing technology for products other than those being developed by us, our affiliates or sublicensees.

Competition

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our directed evolution platform, differentiated product candidates and scientific expertise in the field of gene therapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.

In the last 12 months the market saw advancement in private gene therapy companies as well as a surge in initial public offerings of gene therapy focused companies with competitive platforms and programs. These companies include MeiraGTx, Dimension 

&#160;

Therapeutics, Inc., Voyager Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics, AveX is, REGENXBIO Biosciences, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation and uniQure. 

Our wet AMD program candidates will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development for wet AMD using therapeutic modalities such as biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. Existing anti-VEGF therapies, Lucentis&#174;, EYLEA&#174; and Avastin&#174;, are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD.

There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of wet AMD, including Allergan, Iconic Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Santen Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, REGENXBIO Biosciences LLC, Ohr Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, and Mesoblast Limited.

Our other preclinical product candidates that are being developed for the treatment of prevalent or rare ophthalmic diseases, such as the prevention of wet AMD, color vision deficiency and XLRS, for which there are no approved therapies. However, there are multiple companies developing gene therapies for ophthalmic diseases, including Applied Genetic Technologies Coporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc., Eos Neuroscience, Inc., GenSight Biologics, Genzyme Corporation, Hemera Biosciences, Inc., RetroSense Therapeutics, LLC, Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Oxford Biomedica plc, Sanofi-Aventis S.A., NightStaRx Limited and 4D Molecular Therapeutics, LLC.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.

License and Collaboration Agreements

Regeneron Research Collaboration and License Agreement 

In May 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron to research, develop and commercialize certain gene therapy products based on our proprietary viral vectors that express transgenes encoding molecules that modulate up to a total of eight specified targets, and encoding certain endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such targets. Such products, including AVA-311, are referred to collectively as &#8220;Products.&#8221; Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Regeneron will conduct a research program to identify potential Products for a specified time period. Regeneron will bear all costs of performing research under the Collaboration Agreement. Regeneron has a right to substitute a certain number of such targets and may, subject to a payment to us, expand the collaboration beyond the four initially designated targets to include up to four additional targets not currently being researched or developed by Avalanche, and endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such additional targets, in the research program. Regeneron has an option, exercisable with respect to all Products containing transgenes expressing molecules that 

&#160;

modulate one of the specified targets, to ob tain an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, use, import, export, make, manufacture and commercialize such Products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of human disease or other medical disorders. Regeneron may exercise this option pri or to the expiration of the term of the research program, within a certain time period after the acceptance for filing with the FDA of the IND for such Products. Regeneron must pay us an option fee each time it exercises an option. 

Regeneron has the right to file an IND with the FDA for Products prior to exercising its option. If Regeneron exercises its option for specified Products, Regeneron will be primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing such Products.

We have a right to co-fund costs of developing, manufacturing and commercializing Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a target with respect to which Regeneron has exercised its option, subject to certain exceptions. We may exercise this co-funding right up to two times. If we exercise such right, we may elect to bear up to 35% of all development costs incurred for such Products. For any co-funded Products, Regeneron&#8217;s payment obligations extend until the Product is no longer sold in the applicable territory. For those Products for which we exercise this option, either party may opt out of sharing development costs for all Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a protein target, in which case the other party may continue to develop and commercialize such Products, subject to the payment of a royalty to the other party ranging from low-single digit to low double digit royalties. While Regeneron will record all revenue from sales of the co-funded Products, Regeneron will share in the net profits and losses of sales of any Products for which we exercised our co-funding right, with each party receiving a share of profits and bearing its share of losses in accordance with the share of development costs borne by each party for such Product, provided that neither party exercises its opt-out right for such Products.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron made an initial payment of $8.0 million dollars for collaboration research costs, a one-time option fee and a one-time license grant fee.

In addition to the initial payment, Regeneron may make the following payments to us:

&#160;

&#183; 

reimbursement for additional collaboration research costs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

up to $80.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each of the eight therapeutic candidates, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight therapeutic targets subject to the Collaboration Agreement; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

tiered, low- to mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments. 

For each Product, Regeneron&#8217;s payment obligations extend until the last to occur of the following: (i) the discontinuation of development of the Product or (ii) once a Product is approved by the FDA, the later of (x) the duration of patent coverage for the Product or (y) ten years after first commercial sale of the Product in a particular territory.

The Collaboration Agreement continues until the expiration of the option period for all Products, which occurs on May 1, 2017 if Regeneron has not exercised any options for a Product prior to such date. If Regeneron exercises an option for a Product prior to such date, the Collaboration Agreement continues in effect with respect to that Product on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of all payment obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated (i) by Regeneron at will, either in its entirety or on a target by target basis, upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to us, (ii) by either party, upon written notice in connection with a material breach remaining uncured 60 days after initial written notice, (iii) by us, if Regeneron challenges the patent rights licensed by us under the Collaboration Agreement or (iv) by either party, for insolvency of the other party. Regeneron had a time-limited right of first negotiation for certain rights to AVA-101 as part of our collaboration, In September 2015, we initiated, by notice and delivery of AVA-101 clinical data to Regeneron, the time period for Regeneron to elect whether to exercise its right of first negotiation. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the Company that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation.

University of California License Agreement

In May 2010, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of University of California (Regents) as amended in September 2013. Under the license agreement, the Regents have granted to us an exclusive (even as to the Regents) license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents&#8217; undivided interest in patent rights covering a method of using recombinant gene delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye, to develop, make, have made, use offer for sale, import, export and sell products covered by such patent rights in all fields of use in the United States. The licensed patent rights are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron Corporation, but our license extends only to the Regents&#8217; interest in such patent rights.

&#160;

Under the license agreement, we are required to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of licensed products, which includes obligations to meet certain development-stage m ilestones within specified periods of time, and to market the resulting licensed products in sufficient quantity to meet market demand. We have the right and option to extend the date by which we must meet any milestone by six-months up to two times by pay ing an extension fee for each such extension. 

We have paid the Regents a license fee of $100,000. We are also obligated to make milestone payments totaling up to $900,000 upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for one indication, and totaling up to $500,000 for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. We must pay the Regents a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products by us or our sublicensees, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, until the patent rights upon which such royalties are based expire or are held invalid, which is currently expected to occur in 2020, subject to any potential patent term extensions. We are obligated to reimburse the Regents for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents. Finally, we are obligated to pay the Regents a mid-teen percentage of non-royalty licensing revenue we receive from sublicensees.

Our license agreement with the Regents continues until the expiration of our royalty obligations. We may terminate this agreement without cause at any time upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement for a breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days, if we become insolvent, if we directly or through a third party file a claim that a licensed patent right is invalid or unenforceable or if we fail to meet or extend the date for meeting certain diligence milestones.

Intellectual Property

Overview

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.

We have more than 60 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 38 patent applications have been filed in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 12 patents have issued to us or to our licensors that are active. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

Company Owned IP

We own a family of patent applications that are directed to AAV-based compositions and methods for treating or preventing eye diseases associated with neovascularization. The applications in this family relate to the AVA-101 composition, various unit dosages, dosing regimens and routes of administration. Four applications in this family are pending in the United States, and corresponding patent applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and South Africa. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions.

&#160;

We are also pursuing innovative w ays to regulate the expression of transgenes in tissues. To that end, we have, in collaboration with Stanford University, filed a U.S. patent application that is directed to methods for regulating gene expression in a subject. Any patents that grant from t his application are expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions. 

Licensed IP

We have obtained exclusive licenses to patents directed to both compositions of matter and methods of use.

For example, we have exclusively licensed the rights of the Regents to a U.S. patent directed to methods of treating ocular disease that relate to methods of using AVA-101. This patent is co-owned by the Regents and by Chiron Corporation, and will expire in 2020, unless a term extension is obtained for such patent. There are no foreign patents in this patent family.

We have exclusively licensed several families of patents and applications that relate to variant rAAV virions having desirable characteristics, such as increased infectivity, as well as novel methods to screen for such variants.

One patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes granted patents in Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain; three pending U.S. patent applications; and a pending patent application in Canada. The patents are projected to expire in 2024, subject to possible patent term extensions, as are any patents that granted from the pending applications.

Another patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes a granted U.S. patent that is projected to expire in 2031 and a pending U.S. patent application which, if granted, is also projected to expire in 2031, in both cases subject to possible patent term extensions.

A third patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes three pending U.S. patent applications and pending corresponding applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2032, subject to possible patent term extensions.

We have also nonexclusively licensed rights to a patent family that includes an issued European patent and related Chinese and U.S. patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing. The European patent is expected to expire in 2027, as are any patents that may grant from the related patent applications.

Trademark Protection

We have registered trademarks in connection with our biological products. We may pursue additional registrations for future products in markets of interest. In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.

Trade Secret Protection

Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation

The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of our product candidates. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates.

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the FDA implements regulations and other laws, inclu ding, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subjec t to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial su spension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Our product candidates may be subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologi cs require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. Similarly, FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously ap proved drug, can be marketed in the United States. 

Within the FDA, CBER regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#8217; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, viral shedding, environmental assessments, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. FDA guidance documents provide the agency's current thinking about a particular subject, but are not legally binding.

The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the purity, potency, safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

prior to commercialization satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product. 

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Before testing any biologic product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.

Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation are submitted to, and the study is registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH 

&#160;

Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory com mittee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC's decision regarding the nece ss ity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. 

The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition, if a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH convenes the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss selected protocols and informed consent documents that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by FDA.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, including the requirements for informed consent from all subjects. FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long- term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.

All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.

Clinical Trials

For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited subject population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#8220;pivo tal&#8221; studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse subject population at multiple, geographically-di spersed clinical trial sites. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after the product&#8217;s approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the product. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the

information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.

These phases of testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Biologics License Applications 

The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless a waiver applies, and is subject to a sixty day review period to determine if the application is substantially complete to permit substantive review.

&#160;

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has a goal of responding to BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review and within six months for priority review, but FDA review may not occur in a timely basis. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 

&#160;

The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recomm endations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, which may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Moreover, even if a product receives approval, the approval may be signi ficantly limited to specific disease and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited or subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies , which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or suppleme nt thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of any biologic or drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialize d. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic or drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished biologic or drug product, and sometimes, for drug products, the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the product unless compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements is satisfactory.

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the biologics or drugs. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

Other Regulatory Requirements

Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic and drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160;

Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavio r of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label use. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;

state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impact our financial results.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product 

&#160;

candidates may not be considered medically ne cessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid he alth care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Prog ram, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled , implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and mea sures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

International Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one reference member state (RMS), and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competing Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.

In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
