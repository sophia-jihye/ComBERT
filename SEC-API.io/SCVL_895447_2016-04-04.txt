 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation&#8217;s largest family footwear retailers, providing the convenience of shopping at any of our over 400 store locations or online. We offer customers a broad assortment of moderately priced dress, casual and athletic footwear for men, women and children with emphasis on national and regional name brands. We differentiate our retail concept from our competitors&#8217; by our distinctive, fun and promotional marketing efforts. On average, our traditional stores are 11,000 square feet, generate approximately $2.4 million in annual sales and carry inventory of approximately 27,100 pairs of shoes per location. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 405 stores in 34 states and Puerto Rico and offered online shopping at www.shoecarnival.com.

&#160;

We are an Indiana corporation that was initially formed in Delaware in 1993 and reincorporated in Indiana in 1996. References to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Shoe Carnival, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

Key Competitive Strengths 

We believe our financial success is due to a number of key competitive strengths that make Shoe Carnival a destination of choice for today&#8217;s retail consumer.

&#160;

Distinctive shopping experience 

&#160;

Our stores combine competitive pricing with a promotional, in-store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and injects fun and surprise into every shopping experience. We promote a high-energy retail environment by decorating with exciting graphics and bold colors, and by featuring a stage and mic-person as the focal point in each store. With a microphone, this mic-person announces current specials supplied by our centralized merchandising staff, organizes contests and games, and assists and educates customers with the features and location of merchandise. Our mic-person offers limited-duration promotions throughout the day, encouraging customers to take immediate advantage of our value pricing. We believe this fun and promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building of a loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods. A similar customer experience is reflected in our e-commerce site through special promotions and limited time sales, along with relevant fashion stories featured on our home page.

&#160; 

Broad merchandise assortment 

&#160;

Our objective is to be the destination retailer-of-choice for a wide range of consumers seeking value priced, current season name brand and private label footwear. Our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family. Our average store carries approximately 27,100 pairs of shoes in four general categories &#8211; women&#8217;s, men&#8217;s, children&#8217;s and athletics &#8211; which are organized within the store by category and brand, thus fashioning strong brand statements within the aisles. We engage our customers by presenting creative branded merchandise statements and signage upon entering our stores. Key brands are further emphasized by prominent displays on end caps, focal walls, and within the aisles. These displays may highlight a product offering of a single vendor, highlight sales promotions, advertise promotional pricing to meet or beat competitors&#8217; sale prices or may make a seasonal or lifestyle statement by highlighting similar footwear from multiple vendors. These visual merchandising techniques make it easier for customers to shop and focus attention on key name brands. Our e-commerce site offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear, and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to Shoe Carnival, in both existing and new markets. Customers who enroll in our loyalty program (&#8220;Shoe Perks&#8221;) or register on our website receive periodic personalized e-mail communication from us. This communication affords us additional opportunity to highlight our broad product assortment and promotions.

&#160;

Value pricing for our customers 

&#160;

Our marketing effort targets moderate income, value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups. We believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices, we generate broad customer appeal. Additionally, the time conscious customer appreciates the convenience of one stop shopping for the entire family, whether it is at any of our over 400 store locations or online at shoecarnival.com. We also believe our fun and promotional shopping environment contributes to a reputation of value pricing.

&#160; 

Efficient store level cost structure 

&#160;

Our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively. We achieve low labor costs by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format, allowing customers to serve themselves, if they choose. This reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales. We locate stores predominantly in open-air shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers.

&#160; 

Heavy reliance on information technology 

&#160; 

We have invested significant resources in information technology. Our proprietary inventory management and advanced point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) systems provide corporate management, buyers and store managers with the timely information necessary to monitor and control all phases of operations. The POS provides, in addition to other

&#160;

features, full price management (including price look-up), promotion tracking capabilities (in support of the spontaneous nature of the in-store price promotions), real-time sales and gross margin by product category at the store level and customer tracking. Using the POS, store managers are able to monitor sales and gross profit margins on a real-time basis throughout the day. Reacting to sales trends, our mic-people use POS reports to choose from among a number of product promotions supplied by our centralized merchandising staff.

&#160;

Our centralized network connects our corporate office to our distribution center and retail stores via a wide area network, providing up-to-date sales and inventory information as required. Our data warehouse enables our merchandising and store operations staff to analyze sales, margin and inventory levels by location, by day, down to the size of shoe. Using this information, our merchandise managers meet regularly with vendors to compare their product sales, gross margins and return on inventory investment against previously stated objectives. We believe timely access to key business data has enabled us in the past to drive annual comparable store sales increases, manage our markdown activity and improve inventory turnover.

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to continue to grow our net sales and earnings by opening additional stores throughout the United States and growing our e-commerce business. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 405 stores located across 34 states and Puerto Rico. Our traditional stores averaged approximately 11,000 square feet, ranging in size from 6,000 to 26,500 square feet. Our current traditional store prototype utilizes between 7,500 and 11,000 square feet. Store size depends upon, among other factors, the location of the store and the population base we expect the store to service. Our stores are located predominantly in open-air shopping centers. The sales area of most stores is approximately 87% of the gross store size.

&#160;

We believe there is opportunity to expand into new, and fill-in existing, markets over the next several years with small-market stores. We opened our first small-market concept store in October 2015 and our second small-market concept store in early November 2015. Our small-market stores provide consumers in local communities with a convenient shopping experience with greater accessibility to our moderately priced, branded footwear. Our current small-market store prototype utilizes between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet.

&#160;

Expanding our store base both in number of stores, as well as geographic footprint 

&#160;

Increasing market penetration by opening new stores is a key component of our growth strategy. We believe our strong unleveraged financial position provides a solid platform for additional growth. For fiscal 2015, we opened 20 new stores and closed 15 stores. Approximately 65% of these new store locations served to fill in certain existing markets with additional stores, with the goal of increasing the performance of the overall market. The majority of the remaining 35% of our new store openings were in new major markets. For fiscal 2016, we expect to open approximately 20 stores. Our planned new store expansion for fiscal 2016 includes six small-market concept stores, with the remainder primarily serving to fill-in existing markets.

&#160;

Critical to the success of opening new stores in larger markets or geographic areas is our ability to cluster stores. In larger markets (populations greater than 400,000), clustering involves opening two or more stores at approximately the same time, and in smaller markets that can only support a single store, clustering involves seeking locations in reasonably close proximity to other existing markets. This strategy creates cost efficiencies by enabling us to

&#160;

leverage store expenses with respect to advertising, distribution and management costs. We believe the advantages of clustering stores in existing markets will lead to cost efficiencies and overall incremental sales gains that should more than offset any adverse effect on sales of existing stores.

&#160;

We lease all store locations, as we believe the flexibility afforded by leasing allows us to avoid the inherent risks of owning real estate, particularly with respect to underperforming stores. Before entering a new market, we perform a market, demographic and competition analysis to evaluate the suitability of the potential market. Potential store site selection criteria include, among other factors, market demographics, traffic counts, tenant mix, visibility within the center and from major thoroughfares, overall retail activity of the area and proposed lease terms. The time required to open a store after signing a lease depends primarily upon the property owner&#8217;s ability to deliver the premises. After we accept the premises from the property owner, we can generally open a turnkey store within 60 days and open an &#8216;as-is&#8217; store within up to 115 days.

&#160; 

Multi-Channel Strategy 

&#160;

We are committed to establishing Shoe Carnival as a world class multi-channel retailer. The foundation of our multi-channel strategy is to make available the breadth and depth of our entire store-level inventory to customers shopping by whatever channel they prefer for that particular transaction. We believe over time the majority of our customers will utilize more than one of our available channels to purchase footwear or accessories based on their needs at that time. Our e-commerce business continues to grow and in fiscal 2015 we continued to make enhancements to capitalize on our increasing website traffic and optimize conversion rates. Our &#8220;ship from store&#8221; program is a core element of our multi-channel strategy. This program allows stores to fulfill online orders. As of the end of fiscal 2015, this program had been implemented on a chain wide basis (with limited exceptions). Another important part of our multi-channel strategy is our Shoes 2U program, which we launched in fiscal 2015. This program enables us to ship product from any store to a customer&#8217;s home if they are unable to find the size, color or style of a shoe in the store in which they are shopping. This creates an endless aisle experience for our customers in which our chain-wide inventory is accessible to any store customer. A third component of our multi-channel strategy is our mobile app. Our mobile app was redesigned during 2015 and introduced e-commerce functionality directly from the app. Product offerings on the app correspond to our online assortment and customers now have the ability to scan UPC codes to find sizes that may not be available in our stores. Overall, we believe that our ongoing multi-channel initiatives represent the cornerstone for our long-term growth and are in-line with rapidly changing consumer trends and expectations.

&#160; 

Merchandising and Pricing 

We offer a large selection of value priced footwear for the entire family. Our traditional stores carry an average of approximately 27,100 pairs of shoes featuring a broad assortment of current-season name brand footwear, supplemented with private label merchandise. Our stores also carry complementary accessories such as socks, belts, shoe care items, handbags, jewelry, scarves and wallets. The mix of merchandise and the brands offered in a particular store reflect the demographics of each market, among other factors. Our e-commerce site offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear, and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to Shoe Carnival, in both existing and new markets. Due to our multi-channel retailer strategy, we view our e-commerce sales as an extension of our physical stores.

&#160; 

Initial pricing levels are typically established in accordance with the manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail pricing structure. Subsequent to this initial pricing, our buying staff manages our markdown cadence based on product-specific sell-through rates to achieve liquidation of inventory within the natural lifecycle of the product. We emphasize our value proposition to customers by combining current season name brand product with promotional pricing. Our promotions include both advertised limited time sale offerings in addition to in-store and online timed specials.

&#160;

&#160;

The table below sets forth our percentage of sales by product category:

&#160;

Women&#8217;s, men&#8217;s and children&#8217;s non-athletic footwear categories are further divided into dress, casual, sport, sandals and boots. We classify athletic shoes by functionality, such as running, basketball or fitness shoes.

&#160;

We continue to focus on growing our women&#8217;s category at a rate higher than the balance of our other footwear categories, with the long term goal of expanding our women&#8217;s non-athletic sales to 30% of our total sales. We believe that development of new brands traditionally found in department stores plays a vital role in achieving this goal, and during fiscal 2015, our women&#8217;s better brands were sold in 171 stores. By the end of fiscal 2016, we plan to expand our better brands initiative to approximately 195 stores, primarily by including our better brands in new stores opening in fiscal 2016.

&#160;

Building Brand Awareness 

Our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image across all aspects of our operations. We utilize a blend of advertising mediums and marketing methods to communicate who we are and the values we offer. Special emphasis is made to highlight brands as well as specific styles of product, and visual graphics are used extensively in our stores to emphasize the lifestyle aspect of the styles we carry. The use of social media has become an increasingly important medium in our digital marketing efforts, allowing us to directly communicate with, as well as advertise to, our core customers. For fiscal 2015, approximately 53% of our total advertising budget was directed to television, radio and digital media. Print media (including inserts, direct mail and newspaper advertising) and outdoor advertising accounted for the balance. We make a special effort to utilize the cooperative advertising dollars and collateral offered by vendors whenever possible. We utilize television advertising, including national cable advertising, to deliver a balanced mix of both branding and seasonal product messaging across the year beginning with the Easter selling season. Moreover, it enables us to provide a message of offering value-priced, current season footwear.

&#160;

In addition to a dynamic, lively and fun shopping experience, we offer our customers our Shoe Perks rewards program. This program provides customers with a heightened shopping experience, which includes exclusive offers and personalized messaging. Rewards are earned by making purchases either in-store or online and through participating in other point earning opportunities that facilitate engagement with our brand.

&#160;

Continuing an initiative began in 2013, we remain highly focused on expanding Shoe Perks enrollment. In fiscal 2015, our Shoe Perks rewards program membership increased by approximately 50%, with purchases from Shoe Perks members increasing to 55% of our net sales. We believe our Shoe Perks program affords us tremendous opportunity to communicate, build relationships, and engage with our most loyal shoppers and increase our customer touch points, which we believe will result in long-term sales gains.

&#160;

&#160;

We strive to make each store opening a major retail event. Major promotions during grand openings and peak selling periods feature contests and prize giveaways. We believe our grand openings help establish the high-energy, promotional atmosphere that develops a loyal, repeat customer base and generates word&#45;of&#45;mouth advertising.

&#160; 

Distribution 

We operate a single 410,000 square foot distribution center located in Evansville, Indiana. Our facility is leased from a third party and can support the processing and distribution needs of a minimum of 460 stores to facilitate future growth. We have the right to expand the facility by 200,000 square feet, which would provide us processing capacity to support approximately 650 stores.

&#160;

Our distribution center is equipped with state-of-the-art processing and product movement equipment. The facility utilizes cross docking/store replenishment and redistribution methods to fill store product requirements. These methods may include count verification, price and bar code labeling of each unit (when not performed by the manufacturer), redistribution of an order into size assortments (when not performed by the manufacturer) and allocation of shipments to individual stores. Throughout packing, allocating, storing and shipping, our distribution process is essentially paperless. Merchandise is typically shipped to each store location once per week. For stores within the continental United States, a dedicated carrier, with occasional use of common carriers, handles the majority of shipments. Our shipments to Puerto Rico are loaded for containerized overseas shipment, with final delivery by a third party provider.

&#160;

During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we brought fulfillment of our e-commerce orders in-house, utilizing the inventory in our physical stores. By fulfilling e-commerce orders from our store level inventory, we are able to minimize out-of-stocks, offer our customers an expanded online assortment, and leverage store level inventory and overhead. At January 30, 2016, except for a few limited exceptions, all of our store locations had the capability of fulfilling e-commerce orders on a daily basis. During peak sales periods, e-commerce orders for certain key items and promotional product are fulfilled from our distribution center.

&#160; 

Buying Operations 

Maintaining fresh, fashionable merchandise is critical to our success. Our buyers stay in touch with evolving trends by subscribing to an industry leading trend service, shopping fashion-leading markets, attending national trade shows, gathering vendor input and monitoring the current styles shown in leading fashion and lifestyle magazines. Management of the purchasing function is the responsibility of our Executive Vice President - General Merchandise Manager. Management encourages store operations personnel to provide input to our merchandising staff regarding market specific fashion trends.

&#160;

We purchase merchandise from approximately 170 footwear vendors. In fiscal 2015, two branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales. Nike, Inc. accounted for approximately 31% of our net sales and Skechers USA, Inc. accounted for approximately 12% . Name brand suppliers also provide us with cooperative advertising and visual merchandising funds. A loss of any of our key suppliers in certain product categories or our inability to obtain name brand or other merchandise from suppliers at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long&#45;term contracts with our suppliers.

&#160;

Competition 

The retail footwear business is highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection, price, fashion, quality, location, shopping environment and service. We compete with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, online retailers and mass merchandisers. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices. We compete with off-price retailers, mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise.

&#160;

Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources. However, we believe that

&#160;

our distinctive retail format, in combination with our wide merchandise selection, competitive prices and low operating costs, enables us to compete effectively.

&#160; 

Store Operations 

&#160; 

Management of store operations is the responsibility of our Executive Vice President - Store Operations, who is assisted by divisional managers, regional directors, regional managers and the individual store general managers. Generally, each store has a general manager and up to three store managers, depending on sales volume. Store operations personnel make certain merchandising decisions necessary to maximize sales and profits primarily through merchandise placement, signage and timely clearance of slower selling items. Administrative functions are centralized at the corporate headquarters. These functions include accounting, purchasing, store maintenance, information systems, advertising, human resources, distribution and pricing. Management oversight for e-commerce is also located at our corporate headquarters.

&#160; 

Employees 

At January 30, 2016, we had approximately 5,500 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were employed on a part-time basis. The number of employees fluctuates during the year primarily due to seasonality. No employees are represented by a labor union.

&#160;

We attribute a large portion of our success in various areas of cost control to our inclusion of virtually all management level employees in incentive compensation plans. We contribute all or a portion of the cost of medical, disability and life insurance coverage for those employees who are eligible to participate in Company&#45;sponsored plans. Additionally, we sponsor retirement plans that are open to all employees who have met the minimum age and work hour requirements. All employees are eligible to receive discounts on purchases from our stores. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores. Non-capital expenditures, such as advertising and payroll, incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred. Therefore, our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre-opening expenses related to the opening of new stores.

&#160;

We have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas. To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability. Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods.

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160;

We own the following federally registered trademarks and service marks: Shoe Carnival &#174; and associated trade dress and related logos, The Carnival &#174; , Donna Lawrence &#174; , Innocence &#174; , Y-NOT? &#174; , UNR8ED &#174; , Solanz &#174; , Cabrizi &#174; , Shoe Perks &#174; , SC Work Wear &#174; , WHEN YOU WANT 2 &#174; , JUMP BACK IN &#174; , STEP OUT OF BORING &#174; , A SURPRISE IN STORE &#174; , SHOES 2U &#174; , and Laces for Learning &#174; . We believe these marks are valuable and, accordingly, we intend to maintain the marks and the related registrations. We are not aware of any pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use these marks.

&#160;

Environmental 

&#160;

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,

&#160;

earnings or competitive position. We believe the nature of our operations have little, if any, environmental impact. We therefore anticipate no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our current fiscal year or for the near future.

&#160;
