COMPANY OVERVIEW

Sharps Compliance Corp. is a leading full-service national provider of comprehensive waste management services including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous. Our solutions facilitate the proper collection, containment, transportation and treatment of numerous types of healthcare-related materials, including hypodermic needles, lancets and other devices or objects used to puncture or lacerate the skin, or sharps, hazardous waste and unused consumer dispensed medications and over-the-counter drugs. We serve customers in multiple markets, such as home health care, retail clinics and immunizing pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, professional offices (physicians, dentists and veterinarians), assisted living and long-term care facilities (assisted living, continuing care, long-term acute care, memory care and skilled nursing), government (federal, state and local), consumers, commercial and agriculture, as well as distributors to many of the aforementioned markets. We assist our customers in determining which of our solution offerings best fit their needs for the collection, containment, return transportation and treatment of medical waste, used healthcare materials, pharmaceutical waste, hazardous waste and unused dispensed medications. Our differentiated approach provides our customers the flexibility to return and properly treat medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused dispensed medications through a variety of solutions and products transported primarily through the United States Postal Service (&#8220;USPS&#8221;). For customers with facilities or locations that may generate larger quantities of waste, we integrate the route-based pickup service into our complete offering. The benefits of this comprehensive offering include single point of contact, consolidated billing, integrated manifest and proof of destruction repository in addition to our cost savings. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive tracking and reporting tools that enable our customers to meet complex medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste disposal and compliance requirements. We believe the fully-integrated nature of our operations is a key factor leading to our success and continued recurring revenue growth. We continue to take advantage of the many opportunities in all markets served as we educate the market place and as prospective customers become more aware of alternatives to traditional methods of disposal (i.e., route-based pickup services).

&#160;

Our key markets include healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, home healthcare providers, assisted living/long-term care, surgery centers, retail pharmacies and clinics and the professional market, which is comprised of physicians, dentists and veterinary practices. The Company&#8217;s flagship product, the Sharps &#174; Recovery System, is a comprehensive solution for the containment, transportation, treatment and tracking of medical waste and used healthcare materials. In October 2014, the Company launched MedSafe &#174; , a patent pending solution for the safe collection, transportation and proper disposal of unwanted and expired prescription medications including controlled substances from ultimate users. MedSafe &#160; has been designed to meet or exceed the new regulations issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) implementing the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), which became effective October 9, 2014. In July 2015 and December 2015, the Company augmented its network of medical and hazardous waste service providers with acquisitions of route-based pickup services in the Northeast serving Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and other neighboring states. Additionally, the Company now services parts of Texas and Louisiana with route-based pickup services. On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired another route-based pickup service which expanded service to New York and New Jersey and strengthened the Company&#8217;s position in the Northeast where we serve an eleven contiguous state region and more than 7,800 Northeast customers located in attractive and densely populated areas.

Our principal executive offices are located at 9220 Kirby Drive, Suite 500, Houston, Texas. Our telephone number at that location is (713) 432-0300. We currently have 99 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution and warehousing operations located in Houston, Texas. We own and operate a fully-permitted treatment facility in Carthage, Texas that incorporates our processing and treatment operations. Over six years ago, we supplemented the treatment facility&#8217;s existing incineration process with an autoclave system, which is a cost-effective alternative to traditional incineration that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens. The autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day-to-day operations. We believe that our Texas facility is one of only ten permitted commercial facilities in the United States capable of treating all types of medical waste, used healthcare materials and unused or expired dispensed medications (i.e., both incineration and autoclave capabilities). The Company utilizes ten treatment facilities owned by subcontractors of the Company which are located across the country for the proper treatment of medical waste and used healthcare materials generated by certain of our customers. This arrangement not only reduces the Company&#8217;s return transportation costs associated with its solutions but also provides back-up treatment facility capabilities in the event of disruption at the Company&#8217;s treatment facility in Carthage, Texas. The Company&#8217;s route-based pick-up service business covers an eleven state region in the Northeast portion of the U.S., as well as Texas and Louisiana. In August 2016, the Company received the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Waste Management permit for the processing of medical waste at its treatment facility located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The 40,000 square foot facility has been permitted as both a medical waste treatment facility, using an autoclave, and as a transfer station for medical, pharmaceutical and trace chemotherapy waste of up to 82 tons per day. The facility is designed to cost-effectively and efficiently process medical waste generated by the Company&#8217;s route-based and mailback customers and also doubles as a distribution center of mailback solutions.

SOLUTIONS OVERVIEW

We offer a broad line of product and service solutions to manage the medical waste and unused dispensed medications generated by our customers. Our primary solutions include the following:

Sharps &#160; Recovery System&#8482; (formerly Sharps Disposal by Mail System &#174; ) : a comprehensive solution for the containment, transportation, treatment and tracking of medical waste generated outside the hospital and large health care facility setting. The Sharps Recovery System includes a securely sealed, leak and puncture resistant sharps container in several sizes ranging from one quart to twenty-eight gallons; USPS-approved shipping box with prepaid priority mail postage; absorbent material inside the container that can safely hold up to 150 milliliters of fluids; a bag for additional containment and complete documentation and tracking manifest. The Sharps Recovery System is transported to our owned or contracted facilities for treatment. Upon treatment or conversion of the waste, we provide electronic proof of receipt and treatment documentation to the customer through our proprietary SharpsTracer &#174; system.

TakeAway Medication Recovery System&#8482; : a comprehensive solution designed to meet or exceed the regulations issued by the DEA implementing the Act, which became effective October 9, 2014. The solution facilitates the proper disposal of unused medications (including controlled substances) from:

&#160;

&#183; ultimate users, which is designed for use in the long-term care, hospice and consumer markets. 

&#183; DEA registrants, which DEA Reverse Distribution solution is a DEA-compliant collection, return and destruction solution for DEA registrants&#8217; expired or unused controlled substances. The system includes prepaid return transportation, materials to package for return, complete documentation of returned pharmaceuticals and proper disposal with online proof of destruction. 

MedSafe &#174; : a patent-pending solution for the safe collection, transportation and proper disposal of unwanted and expired prescription medications, including controlled substances, from ultimate users. MedSafe has been designed to meet or exceed the regulations issued by the DEA implementing the Act, which became effective October 9, 2014. MedSafe is designed for use in retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities, hospice, hospitals/clinics with on-site pharmacies, narcotic treatment facilities and licensed law enforcement.

Route-Based Pickup Service: as a full-service waste management services company, we offer route-based medical and hazardous waste pickup services to customers and prospects that have facilities or branches that generate larger quantities of medical, pharmaceutical (non-controlled) and limited quantities of hazardous waste or where the route-based pickup service is preferred. This blended service of mailback and pickup provides cost-savings benefits by customizing the right solution with each location to reach the best outcome for the customer.

TakeAway Recycle System&#8482;: a solution for the collection and recycling of single-use medical devices from surgical centers and other healthcare facilities. The system consists of containers designed for use in operating rooms or sterile processing departments. The containers are placed in a pre-paid return box for shipping to our treatment facilities where devices are stripped to their basic components and sent to appropriate recycling facilities. The system adds a much needed solution to the market in which many single-use devices are reprocessed or disposed of as regulated medical waste, resulting in wastes that could be recycled.

ComplianceTRAC SM : a more advanced web-based version of the Company&#8217;s compliance and training program. &#160; ComplianceTRAC is designed to improve worker safety while satisfying applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and other requirements for the end-user. The program includes employee training for bloodborne pathogens, compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Hazardous Communication Standard. The online program also provides access to a database of over a million safety data sheets (formerly, material safety data sheets), safety plans, regulatory information and facility self-audits. The program is designed to replace outdated hard copy manuals with an updated platform available 24/7.

Universal Waste Shipback Systems: a jointly-promoted program with Veolia Environmental Services using their RECYCLEPAK &#160; solutions for the collection, transportation and recycling of light bulbs, batteries and other mercury-containing devices. The solution is marketed to existing and prospective customers as a complement to the Company&#8217;s line of medical waste and unused medication management solutions.

Other Solutions : a wide variety of other solutions including TakeAway Environmental Return System&#8482;, SharpsTracer &#174; , Sharps Secure &#174; Needle Disposal System, Complete Needle&#8482; Collection &#38; Disposal System, &#160; Pitch-It IV&#8482; Poles, Asset Return System, Sharps &#174; MWMS&#8482; (a Medical Waste Management System (&#8220;MWMS&#8221;)) and Spill Kit and Recovery System.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The Company continues to focus on core markets and solution offerings that fuel growth. Its key markets include healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, home healthcare providers, assisted living/long-term care, retail pharmacies and clinics and the professional market which is comprised of physicians, dentists, surgery centers and veterinary practices. These markets require cost-effective services for managing medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste.

The Company believes its growth opportunities are supported by the following:

&#183; A large professional market that consists of dentists, veterinarians, clinics, private practice physicians, urgent care facilities, ambulatory surgical centers and other healthcare facilities. This regulated market consists of small to medium quantity generators of medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste where we can offer a lower cost to service with solutions to match individual facility needs. The Company addresses this market from two directions: (i) field sales which focus on larger-dollar and nationwide opportunities where we can integrate the route-based pickup service along with our mailback solutions to create a comprehensive medical waste management offering and (ii) inside and online sales which focus on the individual or small group professional offices, government agencies, smaller retail pharmacies and clinics and assisted living/long term care facilities. The Company is able to compete more aggressively in the medium quantity generator market with the addition of route-based services where the mailback may not be as cost effective. The Company&#8217;s route-based business provides direct service to areas encompassing about 100 million people or 31% of the U.S. population. 

&#160;

&#183; In July 2015 and December 2015, the Company augmented its network of medical and hazardous waste service providers with acquisitions of route-based pickup services in the Northeast serving Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and other neighboring states. In July 2016, the Company acquired another route-based pickup service which expanded service to New York and New Jersey. Additionally, the Company now services parts of Texas and Louisiana with route-based pickup services. The Company directly serves more than 8,100 customer locations with route-based pickup services. With the addition of these route-based pickup regions and the network of medical and hazardous waste service providers servicing the entire U.S., the Company offers customers a blended product portfolio to effectively manage multi-site and multi-sized locations, including those that generate larger quantities of waste. The network has had a significant positive impact on our pipeline of sales opportunities - over 60% of this pipeline is attributable to opportunities providing comprehensive waste management service offerings where both the mailback and pickup service are integrated into the offering. 

&#183; The changing demographics of the U.S. population &#8211; according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Population Estimates and National Projections, one out of five Americans will be 65 years or older by 2030, which will increase the need for cost-effective medical waste management solutions, especially in the long-term care and home healthcare markets. With multiple solutions for managing regulated healthcare-related waste, the Company delivers value as a single-source provider with blended mailback and route-based pickup services matched to the waste volumes of each facility. 

&#183; The shift of healthcare from traditional settings to the retail pharmacy and clinic markets, where the Company focuses on driving increased promotion of the Sharps Recovery System. A recently published report by Accenture states that the number of U.S. retail clinics is projected to increase, as much as 12%-17% per year, driven by patients looking for more convenient care and retail pharmacies increasing the variety and volume of healthcare services they provide. According to the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), 25% of flu shots for adults were administered in a retail clinic with the trend expected to increase. Over the flu seasons from 2011 to 2014, the growth in the Retail flu business for Sharps was between 24% and 36%. Despite the decrease in Retail flu business for fiscal 2016 (the 2015 flu season) of 13% due to a mild flu season, Sharps believes the Retail market should continue to drive long-term growth for the Company as consumers increasingly use alternative sites, such as retail pharmacies, to obtain flu and other immunizations. 

&#183; The passage of regulations for ultimate user medication disposal allows the Company to offer new solutions (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes) that meet the regulations for ultimate user controlled substances disposal (Schedules II-V) to retail pharmacies. Additionally, with the new regulations, the Company is able to provide the MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery Systems to assisted living and hospice to address a long standing issue within long-term care. 

&#183; Local, state and federal agencies have growing needs for solutions to manage medical and pharmaceutical waste &#8212; the Company's Sharps Recovery System is ideal for as-needed disposal of sharps and other small quantities of medical waste generated within government buildings, schools and communities. The Company also provides TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes and MedSafe solutions to government agencies in need of proper and regulatory compliant medication disposal. 

&#183; With an increased number of self-injectable medication treatments and local regulations, the Company believes its flagship product, the Sharps Recovery System, continues to offer the best option for proper sharps disposal at an affordable price. The Company delivers comprehensive services to pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell high-dollar, self-injectable medications, which include data management, compliance reporting, fulfillment, proper containment with disposal, branding and conformity with applicable regulations. In addition, the Company provides self-injectors with online and retail purchase options of sharps mailback systems, such as the Sharp Recovery System and Complete Needle Collection &#38; Disposal System, respectively. 

&#183; A heightened interest by many commercial companies who are looking to improve workplace safety with proper sharps disposal and unused medication disposal solutions &#8212; the Company offers a variety of services to meet these needs, including the Sharps Secure Needle Disposal System, Sharps Recovery System, Spill Kits and TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes. 

&#160;

&#183; The Company continually develops new solution offerings such as ultimate user medication disposal (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System), mailback services for DEA registrant expired inventory of controlled substances (TakeAway Medication Recovery System DEA Reverse Distribution for Registrants) and shipback services for collection and recycling of single-use medical devices from surgical centers and other healthcare facilities (TakeAway Recycle System). 

TERMINATED CONTRACT AND LEGAL SETTLEMENT

On January 29, 2009, the Company entered into a five-year contract with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs National Acquisition Center (&#8220;VA NAC&#8221;) to provide its Sharps MWMS, a rapid-deployment solution designed to provide medical waste collection, storage and treatment in the event of natural disasters, pandemics, man-made disasters or other national emergencies in support of the CDC Division of Strategic National Stockpile. Sharps MWMS also incorporated warehousing, inventory management, training, data and other services necessary to provide a comprehensive solution. Sharps performed under the contract through January 31, 2012. On June 30, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to settle its claims against the United States government and various agencies related to the January 2012 termination of the Company&#8217;s February 2009 contract with the VA NAC. The settlement agreement resulted in a cash payment of $1.5 million by the government, which was received by the Company in July 2014 and included in the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading full-service national provider of comprehensive and cost-effective waste management services, including medical, pharmaceutical, and hazardous.

We offer a full line of solutions and services that address the proper management of medical waste, used healthcare materials and medication or pharmaceuticals (including controlled substances). We offer a blended product portfolio that includes both a mailback and route-based pickup service to target prospective customers with multi-site and multi-sized locations that may include facilities that generate larger quantities of waste, including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous. This blended offering includes a single point of contact, consolidated billing, regulatory support and complete integration of our SharpsTracer system. Our proprietary SharpsTracer tracking and documentation systems provide customers a comprehensive electronic record of receipt and treatment of their waste to meet regulatory requirements. The Company&#8217;s mail or ship-back based services are generally offered at a significantly lower cost as compared to the traditional route-based pickup services for small quantity generators since the Company utilizes the existing infrastructure of USPS or in some cases United Parcel Service (&#8220;UPS&#8221;) for return transportation. While competitors may attempt to replicate our comprehensive solution offerings, we believe the ability to offer such a comprehensive, value-added turnkey solution is a significant competitive advantage. We have only begun to offer this comprehensive solution over the past four years with the primary focus of our marketing efforts on educating the marketplace about us as an alternative to the historical provider of waste services, including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous.

Vertically-integrated full-service operations.

Our operations are fully integrated, including manufacturing, assembly, distribution, treatment, online tracking and customer reporting. We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution and warehousing operations in Houston, Texas. We own and operate a fully-permitted treatment facility in Carthage, Texas, that incorporates our processing and treatment operations. Over six years ago, we supplemented the treatment facility&#8217;s existing incineration process with an autoclave system, which is a cost-effective alternative to traditional incineration that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens. The autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day-to-day operations. We believe that our Texas facility is one of only ten permitted commercial facilities in the United States capable of treating all types of medical waste, used healthcare materials and unused or expired medications including controlled substances (i.e., both incineration and autoclave capabilities). The Company, under an agreement with several subcontractors, utilizes ten treatment facilities located across the country for the proper treatment of medical waste and used healthcare materials generated by our customers. This has not only reduced the Company&#8217;s return transportation costs but also provides back-up treatment facility capabilities in the event of disruption at the Company&#8217;s treatment facility in Carthage, Texas. In August 2016, the Company received the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Waste Management permit for the processing of medical waste as its treatment facility located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The 40,000 square foot facility has been permitted as both a medical waste treatment facility, using an autoclave, and as a transfer station for medical, pharmaceutical and trace chemotherapy waste of up to 82 tons per day. The facility is designed to cost-effectively and efficiently process medical waste generated by the Company&#8217;s route-based and mailback customers and also doubles as a distribution center of mailback solutions. We track the movement of each shipment from outbound shipping to ultimate treatment and provide confirmation to the customer for their records using our proprietary SharpsTracer tracking and documentation system. We also track treatment volumes associated with pickup services provided as part of our blended product portfolio using SharpsTracer. We also provide customized reporting and comprehensive regulatory support for many of our customers. By controlling all aspects of the process internally, the Company is able to provide a one-stop solution and simplify the tracking and record-keeping processes to meet regulatory requirements for our customers. We believe the fully-integrated nature of our operations is a key factor and differentiator leading to our success and leadership position in our industry.

&#160;

Diverse product markets.

Sharps offers services and products to a wide variety of end markets. The Company&#8217;s growth strategies are focused on our key markets which include healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, home healthcare providers, assisted living/long-term care, surgery centers, retail pharmacies and clinics and the professional market, which is comprised of physicians, dentists and veterinary practices.

Highly scalable business model.

Because of our business model, we can add new business while leveraging our existing infrastructure. Our facilities are able to accommodate significant additional volume, incurring only variable costs of transportation and processing. Once we gain a new customer, our profitability typically increases as our customer base grows with minimal additional overhead expense due to the embedded nature of our products and the ease with which we can accommodate additional volume.

Increased state and federal regulatory attention.

To protect citizens and waste workers from needle stick injuries, six states have passed state-wide legislation or regulations making it illegal to discard used sharps into household trash. Numerous cities, such as Seattle, have passed ordinances making household sharps disposal illegal. Almost all other states, as well as the District of Columbia and territories have passed educational requirements, or released strict guidelines regarding home sharps disposal. Whether legislation or strict guidelines, most of the U.S. population is required or strongly encouraged to not place used sharps in the household trash. In addition, several states and counties have passed ordinances requiring businesses such as hospitals and those that sell syringes to the public, such as retail pharmacies and veterinary clinics, to take back syringes, once used, in regulatory-compliant sharps containers at no charge to the consumer.

In order to reduce accidental poisonings and pollution of our water and municipal water systems, twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have introduced legislation over the last few years intended to manage the disposal of consumer unused medications. Seven states and the District of Columbia have successfully passed such legislation. Passed or pending legislation related to disposal of consumer medications covers about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Further, since 2009, the federal government, nine states and several counties have introduced legislation requiring manufacturer responsibility for consumer generated unused medications. State regulatory agencies are also addressing this issue, including multiple states which now require healthcare providers to avoid sewer and trash disposal of non-hazardous unused medications within their facilities. States such as California, Washington and Minnesota have required assessment and proper treatment by a medical waste disposal company for years. However, other states such as Colorado and Florida are now requiring even small healthcare providers to segregate unused medications for proper disposal. In 2010, Congress passed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act, leading to DEA changes to the Controlled Substances Act in 2014, allowing certain DEA registrants to collect controlled substances from the public. Collection receptacles can now be found in retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities and hospitals throughout the country. In addition, states are beginning to more closely scrutinize generators returning through reverse distribution unused inventory medications classified as qualifying for manufacturer credit that are actually waste pharmaceuticals and should be disposed of as such. As state and federal enforcement of these statutes increases, more companies could turn to solutions such as ours to help manage their medical waste and regulatory compliance. We believe we are well positioned to benefit given our strict adherence to established standards and extensive documentation and records.

&#160;

Environmentally-conscious solution provider.

In addition to providing cost-effective solutions for our customers, the Company is committed to discovering new sustainable initiatives that mitigate the effects of potentially hazardous waste on the environment. Our patented Waste Conversion Process &#8482; repurposes regulated medical waste and unused medications into new resources used in industrial applications, such as the generation of electricity or recycled plastics used in the industrial sector. Our TakeAway Recycle System is a solution for the collection and recycling of single-use medical devices from surgical centers and other healthcare facilities. The system consists of containers designed for use in operating rooms or sterile processing departments. The containers are placed in a pre-paid return box for shipping to our treatment facilities where devices are stripped to their basic components and sent to appropriate recycling facilities. The system adds a much needed solution to the market in which many single-use devices are reprocessed or disposed of as regulated medical waste, resulting in wastes that could be recycled. Our Universal Waste Shipback Program recycles the materials in light bulbs, batteries and other mercury-containing devices for use in new applications. In addition, the use of recycled paper and plastic materials for many of our products further demonstrates our total commitment to environmentally sound business practices. As an organization, the Company is a leading proponent for the development of solutions for the safe disposal of sharps, unused medications (including controlled substances), light bulbs, batteries and other mercury-containing devices in the community and continually works to raise public awareness of the issue.

Experienced and accomplished management team.

Our senior management team has extensive industry experience and is committed to the continued growth and success of our company. Mr. David P. Tusa, CEO and President, in addition to his ten-plus years with the Company has over 20 years of business and public company experience in multiple industries and in companies with revenues up to $500 million. Mr. Brandon L. Beaver, Senior Vice President of Sales, has broad healthcare sales and sales management experience with the Company and at a variety of firms including AIMS/Allied Care, a third party administrator and managed care company. Ms. Diana P. Diaz, CPA, MBA, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has over 25 years of finance, accounting, healthcare and public company industry experience. Mr. Gregory C. Davis, Vice President of Operations, has over 20 years of information technology and operations-related experience. Mr. Khairan Aladwani, Vice President of Assurance/Quality Control, has over 25 years of quality assurance and operations experience, including medical devices, at a variety of companies both private and public. Mr. Dennis Halligan, Vice President of Marketing, has broad marketing experience with the Company and at a variety of firms, including Stir Creative and R.J. Reynolds.

GROWTH STRATEGIES

We plan to grow our business by employing the following primary growth strategies:

Further penetrate existing customers and markets.

Many of our customers who currently use the Sharps Recovery System could also benefit from the TakeAway Medication Recovery System, Medsafe, our hazardous waste solutions, our universal waste solutions or other specialized products. Although currently focused primarily on the proper management of medical and pharmaceutical wastes generated by medical professionals, pharmacies (including chains and mail order), assisted living facilities and other related organizations will develop needs for our other product lines as they expand their patient service offerings. As an entrenched and value-added supplier of treatment solutions, we believe the Company has the ability to capture incremental business from our existing customers.

We are positive about anticipated growth opportunities in the Retail market. Regarding the future of this market, a recently published report by Accenture states that the number of U.S. retail clinics are projected to increase, as much as 12%-17% per year, driven by patients looking for more convenient care and retail pharmacies increasing the variety and volume of healthcare services they provide. According to the CDC, 25% of flu shots for adults were administered in a retail clinic with the trend expected to increase. Over the flu seasons from 2011 to 2014, the growth in the Retail flu business for Sharps was between 24% and 36%. Despite the decrease in Retail flu business for fiscal 2016 (the 2015 flu season) of 13% due to a mild flu season, Sharps believes the Retail market should continue to drive long-term growth for the Company as consumers increasingly use alternative sites, such as retail pharmacies, to obtain flu and other immunizations.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Pharmaceutical Manufacturer billings have growth from $0.3 million to $5.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2016, respectively. We continue to see interest in our patient support program solution among pharmaceutical manufacturers as it relates to self-injectable medications especially related to new drug launches. We believe manufacturers are now, more than ever, focused on (i) product differentiation, (ii) improved interaction with patients and (iii) creating a touch point for individual patient follow-up that could lead to improved therapy outcomes. The Company expects to launch two additional patient support programs for new drug therapies during fiscal year 2017. The patient support programs include the direct fulfillment of the Sharps Recovery System to the pharmaceutical manufacturers&#8217; program participants, which provides the proper containment, return and treatment of the needles or injection devices utilized in therapy. Sharps&#8217; proprietary SharpsTracer system tracks the return of the Sharps Recovery System by the patient to the treatment facility and then makes available to the pharmaceutical manufacturer electronic data. This data assists them in monitoring medication discipline and provides them with a touch point for individual patient follow-up, which potentially could lead to better outcomes. We believe the Company is the leader in providing solutions of this type to this market.

Over the past four years, the Company has developed a network of medical and hazardous waste service providers including those with route-based pickup services, which allows the Company to serve the entire U.S. medical and hazardous waste market. In July 2015 and December 2015, the Company augmented its network of medical and hazardous waste service providers with acquisitions of route-based pickup services in the Northeast serving Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and other neighboring states. On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired another route-based pickup service which expanded service to New York and New Jersey and strengthened the Company&#8217;s position in the Northeast where we serve an eleven contiguous state region and more than 7,800 Northeast customers located in attractive and densely populated areas. &#160; Additionally, the Company has begun to service parts of Texas and Louisiana with route-based pickup services. The Company directly serves more than 8,100 customer locations with route-based pickup services offered to areas encompassing about 100 million people or 31% of the U.S. population. With the addition of these route-based pickup regions and the network of medical and hazardous waste service providers serving the entire U.S., the Company offers clients a blended product portfolio to effectively target current and prospective customers with multi-site and multi-sized locations including those that generate larger quantities of medical and hazardous waste. The offering includes a single point of contact, consolidated billing, regulatory support and complete integration of our SharpsTracer system. The Company believes the comprehensive offering will continue to assist the Company in obtaining larger opportunities whereby the customer has both larger and smaller facilities generating medical waste, used healthcare materials and hazardous waste resulting in a more consistent and predictable revenue base for the Company.

Develop new products and services.

We continue to develop new solution offerings including ultimate user medication disposal (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System), mailback services for DEA registrant expired inventory of controlled substances (TakeAway Medication Recovery System DEA Reverse Distribution for Registrants) and shipback services for the collection and recycling of single-use devices (TakeAway Recycle System). These innovative product and service offerings allow us to gain further sales from existing customers as well as gain new customers who have a need for more comprehensive products. &#160; We will continue our efforts to develop new solution offerings designed to facilitate the proper and cost effective management of medical waste, used healthcare materials, pharmaceutical waste, hazardous waste and unused dispensed medications to better serve our customers and the environment. Additionally, we will continue to seek out and identify prospective new customers and markets for new solutions designed to meet the needs of these new customer segments.

Enhance sales and marketing efforts.

Over the past five years, the Company has made ongoing investments in sales and marketing initiatives to drive growth in two areas:

&#183; Web and Inside Sales &#8212; Through targeted telemarketing initiatives (inside sales), e-commerce driven website and web-based promotional activities, we believe we can drive significant additional growth as we increase awareness of the Company&#8217;s innovative solution offerings with a focus on individual or small group professional offices, government agencies, smaller retail pharmacies and clinics and assisted living/long-term care facilities. 

&#160;

&#183; Field Sales &#8211; The field sales team focuses on larger dollar and nationwide opportunities in most of the markets served. The field sales team is able to address larger opportunities where we can integrate the route-based pickup service along with our mailback solutions to create a comprehensive waste management offering. 

We have seen success with this approach in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and believe the comprehensive offering capabilities will continue to accelerate revenue growth of the Company.

Improve product and service awareness to attract new customers.

As we grow, we continue to focus additional marketing and sales efforts designed to educate professional offices, retail pharmacies and clinics, assisted living and long-term care facilities, home healthcare, government, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other commercial organizations that require cost-effective services for managing medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste of the benefits of our solution offerings and the need for safe, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly methods of waste treatment, including medical, pharmaceutical, and hazardous. We believe that the full-service nature of our solution offerings, ease of our mail and ship-back based delivery system and convenience will attract new customers who are not yet aware of the services we provide. In addition to providing a convenient, cost-effective solution to waste and used healthcare materials treatment, we believe future growth will be driven by the need for our customers to properly document and track the disposal of their waste to maintain compliance with new and existing legislation. We believe our understanding of the legislative process and focus on accurate and thorough electronic tracking of waste disposal or treatment will provide substantial benefits to new customers looking to comply with new standards and promote environmentally cleaner business practices.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND SUPPLIERS

There is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from sales to our major customers . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, one customer represented approximately 17% of revenue. This customer also represented approximately 17%, or $1.0 million, of the total accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2016. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, one customer represented approximately 17% of revenue. This customer represented approximately 7%, or $0.5 million, of the total accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2015. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, one customer represented approximately 20% of revenue. We may be adversely affected by our dependence on a limited number of high volume customers. Management believes that the risks are mitigated by (i) the contractual relationships with key customers, (ii) the high quality and reputation of the Company and its solution offerings and (iii) the continued diversification of our solution offerings into additional markets outside of our traditional customer base.

We currently transport (from the patient or user to the Company&#8217;s facility or subcontracted treatment facilities) the majority of our solution offerings using USPS; therefore, any long-term interruption in USPS delivery services would disrupt the return transportation and treatment element of our business. Postal delivery interruptions are rare. Additionally, since USPS employees are federal employees, such employees may be prohibited from engaging in or continuing a postal work stoppage, although there can be no assurance that such work stoppage can be avoided. We also have an arrangement with UPS whereby UPS transports our TakeAway Recovery System line of solution offerings. The ability to ship items, whether through the USPS or UPS, is regulated by the government and related agencies. Any change in regulation restricting the shipping of medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused or expired dispensed pharmaceuticals through these channels would be detrimental to our ability to conduct operations.

We maintain relationships with multiple raw materials suppliers and vendors in order to meet customer demands and assure availability of our products and solutions. With respect to the Sharps Recovery System solutions, we own all proprietary molds and dies and utilize several contract manufacturers for the production of the primary raw materials. We believe that alternative suitable contract manufacturers are readily available to meet the production specifications of our products and solutions. We utilize national suppliers for the majority of the raw materials used in our other products and solutions and international suppliers for Pitch-It IV Poles.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We have a portfolio of trademarks and patents, both granted and pending. We consider our trademarks important in the marketing of our products and services, including the Sharps logo, Sharps Recovery System, TakeAway Medication Recovery System, MedSafe, SharpsTracer, Sharps Secure, TakeAway Environmental Return System, Complete Needle and PELLA-DRX&#8482; among others. With respect to our registered marks, we continue using such marks and will file all necessary documentation to maintain their registrations for the foreseeable future. We have a number of patents issued, including those applicable to our PELLA-DRX waste conversion process (patent numbers US 8,163,045, US 8,100,989, US 8,268,073 and US 4,440,534), our Sharps Secure Needle Disposal System (patent numbers US 8,162,139 and US 8,235,883), our unique design features related to the TakeAway Environmental Return System drop-off boxes (patent number US 8,324,443) and our Complete Needle Collection &#38; Disposal System (patent number US 4,463,106). We have patents pending on our MWMS rapid deployment system and our MedSafe solution.

&#160;

COMPETITION

There are several competitors who offer similar or identical products and services that facilitate the disposal of smaller quantities of medical waste. There are also a number of companies that focus specifically on the marketing of products and services which facilitate disposal through transport by the USPS (similar to the Company&#8217;s products). These companies include (i) smaller private companies or (ii) divisions of larger companies. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with Stericycle, the largest medical waste company in the country, which focuses primarily on a pickup service business model. With the addition of the route-based pickup services offered through a network of medical and hazardous waste services providers as well as plans to expand our route-based pickup services in Texas and throughout the Northeast, the Company believes it is better positioned with its comprehensive medical waste management offering to compete with Stericycle. As Sharps continues to grow and increase awareness of the proper disposal of syringes and unused medications (including controlled substances), it could face additional and possibly significant competition. We believe our comprehensive line of proven solution offerings, comprehensive medical waste management service offerings, first mover advantages, excellent industry reputation, significant history of market and customer success, quality solutions and products, as well as our capabilities as a vertically-integrated producer of products and services provide significant differentiation in the current competitive market.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Sharps is subject to extensive federal, state and/or local laws, rules and regulations. We are required to obtain permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permission from the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the State of Texas, the State of Pennsylvania and local governments with respect to our facilities and operations. Such laws, rules and regulations have been established to promote occupational safety and health standards and certain standards have been established in connection with the handling, transportation and disposal of certain types of medical and solid wastes, including transported medical waste. Our estimated annual costs of complying with these laws, regulations and guidelines, including environmental laws, is currently less than $200,000 per year. In the event additional laws, rules or regulations are adopted which affect our business, additional expenditures may be required in order for Sharps to be in compliance with such changing laws, rules and regulations.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

In November 2005 and September 2009, the EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality promulgated new regulations under the Clean Air Act and associated state statutes which affect the incineration portion of our operation of the treatment facility located in Carthage, Texas. These regulations modified the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility. These new regulations and the Company&#8217;s Title V permit required additional emissions-related monitoring equipment and compliance. Such changes required us to incur capital expenditures, which have been reflected in cash flows from investing activities in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of cash flows in order to meet the requirements of the new regulations.
