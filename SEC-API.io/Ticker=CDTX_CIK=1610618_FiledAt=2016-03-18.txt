 Item 1. Business. 

We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel anti-infectives for the treatment of diseases that are inadequately addressed by current standard of care therapies. We are developing a balanced pipeline of product and development candidates, with an initial focus on serious fungal infections. Our lead clinical candidates are echinocandins, a proven class of antifungals. Our initial product portfolio comprises two formulations of our novel echinocandin, CD101. CD101 IV is a long-acting therapy for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. CD101 topical, our second product candidate, is being developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, or VVC, and recurrent VVC, or RVVC, a prevalent mucosal infection. In addition, we have developed a proprietary immunotherapy technology platform, Cloudbreak TM , which we use to create compounds designed to direct a patient&#8217;s immune cells to attack and eliminate pathogens that cause infectious disease. We are evaluating Cloudbreak candidates for the treatment of invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis, an infection caused by the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus . We are also evaluating additional opportunities to expand our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform and have the potential to transform the treatment of infectious disease caused by a variety of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.

We are focused on the anti-infectives market, which we believe has the following advantages for the development of innovative products:

&#160;

&#183; 

a high correlation between efficacy in preclinical animal models and outcomes of clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a regulatory environment that provides developers of anti-infectives opportunities to reduce development costs and time to market; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an ability to commercialize anti-infective products with a focused sales and marketing organization for inpatient and outpatient settings; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

attractive commercial opportunities in certain segments of the market, such as the estimated $3.7 billion global prescription systemic antifungal market in which there is high unmet need, high mortality rates and few new agents in development. 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

We are developing a balanced pipeline of product and development candidates as summarized in the table below. 

&#160;

&#160;

CD101 IV

Our lead product candidate, CD101 IV, is a novel molecule in the echinocandin class of antifungals. We are initially developing CD101 IV for the treatment and prevention of systemic Candida infections. These infections include candidemia and invasive candidiasis, fungal infections associated with high mortality rates. 

The current treatment alternatives for systemic fungal infections, including polyenes, azoles and currently-approved echinocandins, have limitations that we believe may be addressed by novel antifungals. While these drugs are largely efficacious, they may cause severe side effects and are known to cause drug interactions that can limit their utility. Echinocandins, introduced in 2001, are increasingly recommended for the treatment of fungal infections in the United States. In December 2015, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or the IDSA, released new clinical guidelines that recognize the important role of echinocandins in the initial treatment of invasive fungal infections. The guidelines recommend a shift to echinocandins as first-line treatment for invasive candidiasis and candidemia. The approved echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, and are considered both well tolerated and safe relative to other antifungal drug classes. However, they must be administered daily by IV infusion, potentially extending the hospitalization of patients for the duration of therapy and limiting their use mainly to the hospital setting. The CDC reports that certain species of Candida are becoming increasingly resistant to available antifungals, such as the azoles and approved echinocandins.

Due to its novel chemical structure, CD101 IV has a prolonged half-life, a high C max , or maximum concentration reached, and a high AUC, or area under the curve, which measures the overall drug exposure per dose. These factors are in contrast to all other echinocandins, and may allow CD101 IV to be developed as a once-weekly IV therapy with greater drug exposures over the course of therapy. We believe that this pharmacokinetic profile may overcome the limitations of the current standard of care by offering the following key benefits:

&#160;

&#183; 

potential to treat resistant pathogens due to CD101 IV&#8217;s higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy; 

&#160;

&#183; 

single-agent treatment across inpatient and outpatient settings; 

&#160;

&#183; 

shorter and less costly hospital stays, enabled by a once-weekly echinocandin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

improved compliance for outpatients; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

more convenient outpatient echinocandin prophylaxis regimens. 

In November 2015, we obtained data from our single ascending dose (SAD) study. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of CD101 in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that CD101 IV was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after single doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

In January 2016, we obtained data from our multiple ascending dose (MAD) Phase 1 study. This wa s a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple intravenous doses of CD101 in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that CD101 IV was well tolerated i n all dose cohorts after multiple doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg in up to three weeks of dosing . In the SAD and MAD studies, CD101 IV exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing. 

We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in candidemia in the first half of 2016. We plan to enroll approximately 90 patients with Candida bloodstream infections and expect results from this trial in the second half of 2017.

The U.S Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted CD101 IV designations for Orphan Drug, Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The orphan drug designation provides eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval, a waiver from payment of user fees, an exemption from performing clinical studies in pediatric patients, and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research. The QIDP designation, provided under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, offers certain incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs, including eligibility for Fast Track designation, priority review and, if approved by the FDA, eligibility for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. Fast Track designation enables more frequent interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to expedite drug development and review. The seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation combined with an additional five years of marketing exclusivity provided by the QIDP designation positions CD101 IV with a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity to be granted at the time of FDA approval.

CD101 Topical

We are developing our second product candidate, CD101 topical, a topical formulation of CD101, for the treatment of VVC and RVVC. RVVC is defined as the occurrence of three or more VVC infections in one year. RVVC is a painful, chronic infection afflicting four to five million women in the United States each year. There are no therapies currently approved for RVVC. Current off-label treatments include chronic self-medication with over-the-counter topical antifungals and the use of prescription fluconazole, an oral azole. Azoles are fungistatic, which means that they slow the growth of, but do not kill, the fungus. In addition, azoles have poor activity against certain species of Candida that cause VVC. Therefore, azoles often fail to prevent recurrent infections in women with RVVC. By contrast, echinocandins, including CD101, are fungicidal, which means that they kill the fungus, including all of the species of Candida that cause VVC. Unlike currently available echinocandins, which can only be administered intravenously, CD101 is being developed for topical use due to its high solubility, stability and activity at vaginal pH values.

We are planning to file our Initial New Drug, or IND, application for CD101 topical during the first half of 2016. Based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we are planning to initiate a Phase 2 multi-site clinical trial in mid-2016 to investigate the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of CD101 topical in women with VVC. We expect results from this trial in the first half of 2017.

Cloudbreak Immunotherapy Platform

We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is a fundamentally new approach for the treatment of infectious disease. The design of the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform recognizes that most infectious disease is due to a temporary deficiency in the function of the immune system. Our Cloudbreak lead candidates are designed to address this deficiency by recruiting components of the patient&#8217;s immune system to the site of infection, enabling more effective treatment. Similar to the way that immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer by redirecting the immune system to destroy cancer cells, we believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has the potential to transform the treatment of infectious disease caused by a variety of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens.

We are currently pursuing both small and large molecule approaches for Cloudbreak. Small molecule Cloudbreak candidates consist of two molecules that are joined by a chemical linker: a targeting moiety, or TM, that recognizes a cell surface target and an effector moiety, or EM, that is recognized by the immune system. In many cases, we can use a commercially approved drug as the TM. By contrast, large molecule Cloudbreak candidates leverage classical targeting and immune engaging components of antibodies and antibody fragments. Large molecule Cloudbreak candidates consist of a TM, which is an antibody that binds cell-surface antigen, and an EM 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

that is recognized by the immune system . The coupling of the TM to the EM results in a bispecific molecule that can direct the immune system specifically to the targeted pathogen. &#160; 

The Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is similar to certain cancer immunotherapies in that it uses molecules with two binding sites, one that binds to a cell surface target and a second that binds to specific receptors on immune cells. Our initial small and large molecule Cloudbreak candidates recruit the innate and adaptive immune system to the site of infection, respectively. Their modular composition allows for rapid exploration of combinations of TM, EM, and linker domains, potentially enabling efficient discovery of anti-infective molecules with the desired potency, specificity and physical properties.

We are expanding our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. This expansion will enable us to select development candidates that effectively engage the immune system and target the site of infection. We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of infectious diseases, including fungal, bacterial and viral infections. We plan to select a lead Cloudbreak development candidate in 2016.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to become the leading biotechnology company in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class anti-infectives. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rapidly advance our initial antifungal candidates to commercialization. We plan to leverage the favorable regulatory environment for anti-infectives to expedite the development of our product and development candidates. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to invest in our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of infectious diseases, including fungal, bacterial and viral infections. We intend to pursue expansion into these therapeutic areas and the generation of new Cloudbreak development candidates to strengthen our pipeline. In addition, we will continue to establish intellectual property related to this platform, its applications and development candidates. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercialize products in the United States with a targeted sales force. The anti-infectives market benefits from an ability to address large sales opportunities with a relatively small, specialized commercial organization. We intend to build and manage a targeted sales and marketing organization to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States, addressing the relatively small base of well-defined customers in both the hospital and outpatient settings. In geographies outside the United States, we may seek to collaborate with other parties to commercialize our products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our management&#8217;s expertise in anti-infectives to acquire or in-license complementary product candidates. In addition to our current product and development candidates, we will evaluate acquisition or in-licensing opportunities to potentially expand and diversify our pipeline. We believe that our management team&#8217;s expertise and experience in the anti-infectives market provides our company with a competitive advantage in evaluating product opportunities. Our management team will focus on opportunistically identifying complementary assets that are at commercial stage or in advanced stages of clinical development. 

2015 Developments

On February 10, 2015, we completed a private placement of approximately $42.0 million of shares of Series B convertible stock.

On April 2, 2015, our board of directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-25.4 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock.

On April 20, 2015, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, whereby we sold a total of 4,800,000 shares of common stock at $16.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $69.3 million after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

During the second half of 2015, we initiated and completed our Phase 1 clinical trials for CD101 IV. We conducted single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trials in healthy volunteers, the results of which demonstrated that CD101 IV was well tolerated in all dose cohorts and exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing. 

Overview of Systemic Fungal Infections and the Antifungal Market

Fungal infections pose significant medical challenges in both hospital and outpatient settings. While fungi are ubiquitous in our environment, they are usually harmless for people with a normal immune system. Most fungal infections are topical and local in nature, occurring on the skin, in the vaginal tract, or in other parts of the body. However, if fungi access and proliferate in the bloodstream, these infections become systemic and potentially life-threatening. Systemic fungal infections typically afflict patients whose immune systems have been compromised, such as patients undergoing organ or bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy or patients with AIDS.

We estimate that the annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungals are approximately $3.7 billion. This includes therapies used as prophylaxis (preventive) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital. The figure below shows management&#8217;s estimates of days of therapy in these various settings, in the United States.

U.S. Days of Therapy (in millions) of Antifungals in Prophylaxis, Hospital and Outpatient (Discharge) Settings (2013) 

&#160;

&#160;

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

The majority of hospital infections are caused by two fungi, Candida and Aspergillus . These fungi are responsible for over 90% of the approximately 97,000 annual deaths in the United States that we estimate are associated with fungal infections. 

U.S. Deaths in Patients with Hospital Treated Fungal Infections

&#160;

&#160;

Physicians&#8217; options for the treatment of fungal infections are limited by a lack of innovative therapies.

Several factors have contributed to the low rate of antifungal and antibiotic drug development, including a previously challenging regulatory environment that necessitated large and costly clinical trials. As a result, the number of anti-infectives in development has decreased, while anti-microbial resistance has increased due to overuse of existing agents.

Systemic Candida Infections: A Growing Medical Challenge

Systemic Candida infections include candidemia and related cases of invasive candidiasis. In the United States, candidemia is the most common cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. While the limited data available on hospitalized patients varies widely, rates of between one and two cases per 1,000 hospital admissions have been reported in the United States, Europe and Latin America.

Despite advances achieved in the diagnosis and treatment of candidemia, these infections continue to cause high mortality rates. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Disease (2009), candidemia has a mortality rate of 35% within 12 weeks of diagnosis. By contrast, the CDC reports that the mortality rate due to MRSA infections is 12.8%. Further, it is estimated that each case of candidemia results in an additional 23 days of hospitalization and over $68,000 in treatment costs.

Candida infections are particularly challenging to treat in patients whose immune systems have been compromised, such as patients undergoing organ or bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy, as well as those with weakened immune systems due to aging and other underlying conditions, including, but not limited to, diabetes, metabolic diseases, HIV and chronic use of antibiotics. 

Current Therapeutic Options

Systemic fungal infections are primarily treated using three classes of antifungals that target either fungal cell membranes or cell wall synthesis. However, each of these antifungal classes has limitations that we believe may be addressed by novel antifungals:

&#160;

&#183; 

Polyenes. Polyenes, first marketed in 1954, were the first drug class discovered to be effective against systemic fungal infections. Polyenes such as amphotericin B bind to and disrupt the integrity of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. Polyenes are associated with severe and potentially life-threatening toxicities, including acute kidney and heart injury, since they are not selective to fungi and also bind to sterols in human tissues. In addition to the severe toxicity associated 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

&#160;

with amphotericin B, many patients report problems with tolerability of this drug; 40% experie nce nausea and/or vomiting and up to 75% experience chills. Polyenes are typically administered by daily IV infusion. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Azoles. Azoles were the next major drug class found to be effective in treating candidemia and related infections, and were first marketed in the 1980s. Azoles block the enzymatic pathway that produces ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, thereby reducing the growth of the fungus but not killing it. This activity is referred to as fungistatic. Azoles are the most frequently used drugs for treatment of systemic fungal infections. While these drugs are largely effective, their side effect profile includes an increased risk of serious liver toxicity as well as rash, visual disturbances, hallucinations and fetal cardiac abnormalities. Azoles are also known to cause drug interactions, including interactions with oral contraceptives, that can limit their utility. In addition, their widespread use has led to the development of resistance, which we believe may limit the future utility of the class. A number of azoles are available in IV, oral, and topical formulations. They are typically administered on a daily basis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Echinocandins. Echinocandins, introduced in 2001, inhibit glucan synthase, a fungal specific enzyme required for synthesis of a key component of fungal cell walls. Inhibition of this enzyme kills Candida . Echinocandins are increasingly recommended for the treatment of fungal infections in the United States. The approved echinocandins, caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, are considered both well tolerated and safe relative to other antifungal drug classes. However, they must be administered daily by IV infusion, potentially extending the hospitalization of patients for the duration of therapy and thereby limiting their use mainly to inpatients. 

Despite the widespread continued use of each class of antifungals, we believe that market opportunities exist for novel therapeutics which combine the spectrum and safety of the echinocandins with a more convenient dosing schedule enabled by improved pharmacokinetic characteristics.

Emerging Resistance to Antifungals

The CDC reports that certain species of Candida are becoming increasingly resistant to available antifungals, such as the azoles and approved echinocandins. Widespread usage of antifungals in the azole class, in particular, has stimulated an increase in resistance. Non-albicans Candida , which have a higher rate of azole resistance, now cause approximately two-thirds of candidemia cases in the US.

Our Solution&#8212;CD101 IV for the Treatment of Candidemia

Our lead product candidate, CD101 IV, has a prolonged half-life which, in contrast to all other echinocandins, may allow it to be developed as a once-weekly IV therapy for the treatment and prevention of systemic fungal infections. We are developing CD101 IV to overcome the limitations of the echinocandin class and other antifungals by offering the following key benefits.

&#160;

&#183; 

Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that CD101 IV can be used to treat fungal infections caused by drug-resistant fungi, including those currently resistant to echinocandins, due to its higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy. We expect that this higher exposure early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Single-agent treatment. Rather than treating patients with an IV echinocandin followed by an oral azole solely to enable earlier hospital discharge, CD101 IV would enable extended single-agent, echinocandin treatment for the full course of therapy, thereby enabling treatment that is consistent with current guidance in the United States and European Union. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Shorter and less costly hospital stays, and less costly outpatient costs. Physicians with access to a once-weekly echinocandin can potentially discharge appropriate patients earlier and thereby reduce hospital costs, which account for over 70% of the overall treatment cost of candidemia. Furthermore, early discharge from the hospital setting may reduce the risk for contracting nosocomial pathogens. For patients discharged on an echinocandin, once-weekly CD101 IV could eliminate significant outpatient infusion costs for once-daily IV echinocandin therapy. 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved compliance. A once-weekly treatment of CD101 IV could facilitate compliance by eliminating the need for patients to return to a hospital or outpatient center for a daily dose of an IV echinocandin, and could eliminate the likelihood of patient non - compliance for thos e receiving oral step down therapy with a daily azole. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Enabling or improving prophylaxis regimens. Some patients cannot receive azole prophylactic therapy due to drug interactions or poor tolerability. We expect that once weekly CD101 IV therapy would provide for better prophylactic therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis, particularly for these patients. 

Preclinical Studies

In Vitro Microbiology Data

In in vitro assays on a panel of 1,077 clinical isolates of Candida and Aspergillus strains, the activity of CD101 compared favorably with that of the approved echinocandins, anidulafungin and caspofungin.

Potency of CD101 Compared to Other Echinocandins

&#160;

&#160;

The numbers in the table refer to the MIC 90 , or minimum concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of isolates. Lower values indicate that the antifungal agent is more potent as it is active at a lower concentration.

In Vivo Efficacy Data

We studied CD101 IV and anidulafungin in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis in immunosuppressed mice. CD101 IV and anidulafungin were administered two hours after inoculation with Candida and the fungal burden in the kidneys, as measured by colony forming units, or CFUs, was determined after 24 hours. The results showed that CD101 IV was significantly more effective in reducing fungal burden compared to anidulafungin administered at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg doses. At 4.5 mg/kg, the efficacy of both drugs could not be differentiated since the fungal burden was at the lower level of detection. In the chart below, p&#60;0.005 and p&#60;0.05 mean that there is a greater than 99.5% and 95% probability, respectively, that the differences observed between treatments are not due to chance alone. Standard practice is to consider a p-value of 0.05 or less to be a statistically significant result.

&#160;

Efficacy of CD101 IV and Anidulafungin in a Mouse Candidiasis Model 

&#160;

Activity Against Resistant Strains

We believe that CD101 IV can address important unmet medical needs in patients with candidemia caused by both susceptible and azole- or echinocandin-resistant Candida , as well as in patients at risk of invasive fungal infections who cannot take azole or polyene antifungals because of drug interactions or safety concerns. In a recent study of cancer patients with Candida infections from MD Anderson Cancer Center, patient prognosis was inversely correlated with resistance to caspofungin. Patients infected with the most drug-sensitive strains had a 28-day survival rate of 75% compared to only 25% for those with caspofungin-resistant strains. CD101 was tested against 23 echinocandin-non-susceptible Candida isolates and demonstrated equivalent or greater potency against these strains compared to caspofungin, with up to eight-fold greater potency for several isolates. We believe that the high potency of CD101 against resistant strains, combined with the very high drug exposure associated with the once-weekly dosing regimen, will result in improved efficacy in treating drug-resistant Candida infections.

In order to be effective, an echinocandin drug should be present at as high an exposure early in therapy as is safely possible. The key pharmacokinetic parameters affecting exposure include the drug&#8217;s half-life, the C max , or the maximum concentration reached, and the overall drug exposure per dose, referred to as the AUC, or area under the curve. The maximum dose that can be used is based on the drug&#8217;s overall safety profile. With echinocandin drugs, high drug exposures early in therapy, as measured by C max or AUC, maximize the antifungal therapeutic benefit of these drugs. When a fungus starts to develop resistance to a drug, the MIC rises, which means that a higher drug exposure will be required in order for the drug to have the same efficacy as it has against sensitive strains. Having a C max and an AUC that are far greater than the starting MIC provides the best chance of treating infections caused by strains resistant to other antifungals, including other echinocandins.

CD101 IV Clinical Results

&#160;

Clinical Studies 

&#160;

In November 2015, we obtained data from our single ascending dose (SAD) study. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of CD101 in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that CD101 IV 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after single doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. CD101 IV exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and suppo rtive of once-weekly dosing. 

&#160;

In January 2016, we obtained data from our multiple ascending dose (MAD) Phase 1 study. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple intravenous doses of CD101 in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that CD101 IV was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after multiple doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. CD101 IV exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing. 

&#160;

For both Phase 1 studies, there were no serious adverse events (SAEs), severe Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), or relationships for overall TEAEs. The majority of TEAEs were mild, and all TEAEs completely resolved by the end of the study. There were no drug-related TEAEs resulting from clinically significant hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities at any dose. In addition, there were no safety issues related to electrocardiograms, vital signs, or physical exam findings. 

&#160;

Based on clinical results to date, we expect a single dose of CD101 IV to provide sufficient drug exposure for a period of seven days. In contrast, a single dose of anidulafungin provides sufficient drug exposure for only one day. The graph below presents the pharmacokinetic results from our single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial. 

&#160;

Pharmacokinetic Properties of CD101 IV

&#160;

Based on results from our single ascending dose trial, CD101 IV has a prolonged half-life of greater than 80 hours in humans. CD101 IV may be safely developed as a once-weekly IV therapy, allowing patients with candidemia to receive sufficient drug exposure in just two to three doses to cover fourteen days of treatment following clearance of the active infection, which is the current recommended course of treatment. 

CD101 IV demonstrated a C max and an AUC significantly higher than other approved echinocandins. Based on the higher drug exposure demonstrated by CD101 IV early in the course of therapy, we believe that CD101 IV can be 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

used to treat some fungal infections caused by drug-resistant fungi, including those currently resistant to echinocandins. We ex pect that this higher exposure early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.

PK measurements marked with an asterisk are from assays conducted by us. Other values are from studies published by third parties.

Clinical Development Plan

Based on discussions with the FDA, we assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of CD101 IV in single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy subjects. Results from these clinical trials have been used to select the dose for a Phase 2 clinical trial in candidemia, which we plan to initiate in the first half of 2016. This Phase 2 clinical trial will include approximately 90 patients with Candida bloodstream infection. The clinical trial will be double-blind, randomized and will include an echinocandin comparator group. We expect results from this trial in the second half of 2017.

In December 2014, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA during which agreement was reached that a single randomized, double-blind, comparative Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial, supported by the data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, could suffice for approval of CD101 IV for the indication of candidemia. A total safety database of at least 300 patients will be required, and possibly more if safety concerns are noted in the course of development. We plan to perform additional clinical research with CD101 IV in both invasive candidiasis and prophylaxis in patients with high unmet need.

Overview of the Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) and Antifungal Treatments for VVC

Three quarters of all women have an episode of VVC at some point in their lives. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, or RVVC, is a condition in which three or more VVC infections occur within a year. RVVC is a painful chronic infection affecting four to five million women in the United States each year with 2.3 million patients seeking treatment from a physician for VVC.

There are no therapies currently approved for the treatment of RVVC. Current off-label treatments include chronic self-medication with over-the-counter topical antifungals and the use of prescription fluconazole, an oral azole. Azoles are fungistatic, which means that they slow the growth of, but do not kill, the fungus. In addition, azoles are not active against certain species of Candida that cause VVC. Therefore, azoles often fail to prevent recurrent infections in women with RVVC and, even after prolonged treatments by azoles, VVC recurs in over 50% of patients. By contrast, echinocandins, including CD101, are fungicidal, which means that they kill the fungus, including the species of Candida that cause VVC. Antifungal agents in other classes such as the polyenes or echinocandins must be administered intravenously, usually in a hospital setting, and thus are not used for the treatment of VVC or RVVC.

Our Solution&#8212;CD101 Topical for the Treatment of VVC and RVVC

We are developing CD101 topical, a topical formulation of CD101, for the treatment of VVC and RVVC. The active ingredient in CD101 topical is CD101, which has demonstrated potent fungicidal activity against Candida species in preclinical studies. Unlike currently available echinocandins, CD101 can be formulated topically due to its high solubility, stability and activity over a wide range of pH values, as demonstrated by testing to date. By contrast, anidulafungin, a currently marketed echinocandin, is virtually insoluble in water. We believe that the

fungicidal activity of CD101 at the site of infection has the potential to be more effective than the fungistatic azoles in reducing recurrence of Candida infections in women with RVVC. 

Preclinical Studies

We conducted preclinical efficacy studies across a range of gel and ointment formulations of CD101 topical and the studies demonstrate that CD101 topical formulations can eliminate Candida in VVC animal models and demonstrates a clear dose-response relationship. We have also conducted preclinical studies to evaluate the tolerability, toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile of CD101 topical gel and ointment formulations when administered topically to female rats and monkeys. CD101 topical gel and ointment formulations of 1% and 10% CD101 were tested. No signs or symptoms of toxicity were observed.

Results showed that CD101 gel/ointment formulations, were highly effective at reducing fungal burden in the rat VVC model. The efficacy of the 3% CD101 exceeded that of 2% miconazole and was comparable to 6.5% tioconazole. Therefore, CD101 may offer a promising alternative for the treatment of VVC in humans.

Clinical Development Plan

We are planning to initiate a Phase 2 multi-site clinical trial in mid-2016 to investigate the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of CD101 topical in women with VVC. In this clinical study, two formulations with distinctly different release profiles will be tested: a fast-release 3% gel and a slow-release 6% ointment. Approximately 125 patients will be enrolled in this study, with 50 patients receiving the 3% gel, 50 patients receiving the 6% ointment, and 25 patients receiving oral fluconazole. Results from this clinical trial will be used to select the optimal formulation of CD101 topical. Following the Phase 2 clinical trial, we plan to conduct two superiority Phase 3 clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy versus oral fluconazole in acute and recurrent VVC.

Our Proprietary Cloudbreak Immunotherapy Platform 

We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is a fundamentally new approach for the treatment of infectious disease. The design of the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform recognizes that most infectious disease is due to a temporary deficiency in the function of the immune system. Our Cloudbreak development candidates are designed to address this deficiency by recruiting components of the patient&#8217;s immune system to the site of infection, enabling more effective treatment. Similar to the way that immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer by directing the immune system to destroy cancer cells, we believe that the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has the potential to transform the treatment of infectious disease caused by a variety of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens. The initial development candidates emerging from the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform are being developed for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, a fungal infection that results in a high rate of mortality. In addition to fungal infections, we plan to pursue applications for the treatment of bacterial and viral infections. In each application, we intend to apply our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform to infections in at-risk patients who could benefit from an improved immune response. We plan to select a lead Cloudbreak development candidate in 2016.

We are currently pursuing both small and large molecule approaches for Cloudbreak. Small molecule Cloudbreak candidates consist of two molecules that are joined by a chemical linker: a targeting moiety, or TM, that recognizes a cell surface target and an effector moiety, or EM, that is recognized by the immune system. In many cases, we can use a commercially approved drug as the TM. By contrast, large molecule Cloudbreak candidates leverage classical targeting and immune engaging components of antibodies and antibody fragments. Large molecule Cloudbreak candidates consist of a TM, which is an antibody that binds cell-surface antigen, and an EM that is recognized by the immune system. The coupling of the TM to the EM results in a bispecific molecule that can direct the immune system specifically to the targeted pathogen. 

Our Cloudbreak development candidates have the potential to feature the following attributes:

&#160;

&#183; 

Small or large molecule components with well-defined targets and efficient testing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

selective binding to pathogens to amplify their immunogenicity (recognition by the immune system) and thereby efficiently recruit the innate and adaptive immune system to assist in the rapid eradication of the pathogen; 

&#160;

&#183; 

use as adjunctive therapy along with standard of care regimens; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

broad applicability in the treatment of infectious diseases. 

The Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is similar to certain cancer immunotherapies in that it uses molecules with two binding sites, one that binds to a cell surface target and a second that binds to specific receptors on immune cells. The modular composition of Cloudbreak compounds allows for rapid exploration of combinations of targeting moiety (TM), effector moiety (EM), and linker domains, potentially enabling efficient discovery of anti-infective molecules with the desired potency, specificity and physical properties.

Manufacturing

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture supplies of CD101 IV, CD101 topical, our Cloudbreak development candidates, and any future product candidates.

CD101 is a semi-synthetic natural product. Thus, the manufacturing process for CD101 involves fermentation and synthetic chemical steps. The process begins with fermentation to produce a natural product, which is conducted by third-party vendors. The natural product is then converted to CD101 in a series of chemical steps.

Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our product and development candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible synthetic processes and common manufacturing techniques. We obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA if necessary to ensure sufficient commercial quantities of each product.

Intellectual Property

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, CD101 IV, CD101 topical, our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, our processes and our know-how are important to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position through patent protection in the United States and internationally for CD101 IV, CD101 topical, our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform and any other technology to which we have rights where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, obtain, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and potentially licensed from third parties and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our inventions, improvements and technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221;

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; 

&#160;

&#183; 

defend and enforce our current and potential future patents; 

&#160;

&#183; 

preserve the confidentiality of any of our trade secrets; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 

We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for CD101 IV, CD101 topical and our product candidates and technology in the United States and abroad. As of February 29, 2016, our patent portfolio included six families of patent applications related to various aspects of CD101, including CD101 IV and CD101 topical, and six families of patent applications related to our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform.

In May 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Seachaid Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Seachaid, whereby we purchased intellectual property related to CD101. We issued 703,092 shares of common stock to Seachaid as consideration for the assets acquired.

We own the rights to a first patent family that provides basic composition of matter coverage for CD101. This first patent family includes two granted United States utility patents and one pending United States utility application, as well as foreign national or regional counterpart patent applications pending in Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India and Japan. We also own the rights to a second patent family directed to oral formulations and dosing regimens for CD101. This second patent family includes one pending U.S. utility patent application and foreign national or regional counterpart patent applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Russia. For any issued patents in these two families, we expect that they would expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.

For our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, we own one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application and five U.S. provisional patent applications. If issued, patents from these patent applications could result in claims to both therapeutic compositions and methods of treatment. Any such patents would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2036, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.

&#160;

Market exclusivity is the exclusive marketing right granted by the FDA and certain foreign equivalents upon the approval of a drug if certain statutory requirements are met. When granted, the applicable regulatory authority will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication during the period of market exclusivity. The length of market exclusivity depends on the type of exclusivity granted. We intend to seek market exclusivity on our candidate products where appropriate.

&#160;

We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for CD101 IV for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. An orphan drug designation by the FDA makes CD101 IV eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for CD101 IV in candidemia and invasive candidiasis.

In addition to the orphan drug designation, CD101 IV was designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product under the GAIN Act making it eligible for an additional five years of market exclusivity.

Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection in several countries for the Cidara trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services. We currently have registered trademarks for the Cidara mark in the United States, the European Union, and Australia and pending trademark applications in the United States and Australia. We also currently have a pending trademark application for Cloudbreak in the United States.

Competition

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

CD101 IV and CD101 topical and our Cloudbreak development candidates , paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of anti-infectives, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutica l, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 

CD101 IV will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for this indication include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck &#38; Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.) and Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.). In addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Mylan Inc. and Glenmark Generics Inc., among others. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that CD101 IV will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including SCY-078 (being developed by Scynexis, Inc.) and isavuconazole (being developed for the treatment of candidemia jointly by Astellas Pharma and Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd.). 

CD101 topical will primarily compete against azole agents (oral, topical and intravaginal), currently used in the treatment of VVC, as well as over-the-counter topical agents used to treat these conditions. The approved prescription therapies for VVC are Diflucan (fluconazole) and Terazol (terconazole). While there are several over-the-counter topical agents such as Monistat (miconazole), Gyne-Lotrimin (clotrimazole) or Gynazole-1 (butoconazole) also used to treat VVC, we do not consider these products to be significant competitors due to their limited efficacy in RVVC and severe acute VVC. Topical therapies for VVC are well accepted. Almost all of the OTC market is comprised of topical therapies, while the prescription market is 40% topical and 60% oral. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that CD101 topical will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including VT-1161 (being developed by Viamet Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and SCY-078 (being developed by Scynexis, Inc.), and albaconazole (being developed by Actavis plc).

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.

Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. 

United States Drug Approval Process

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production of clinical supplies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical Studies and IND

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical Trials

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continui ng review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. 

Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1 : The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2 : The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3 : The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Marketing Approval

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which fees are typically increased annually.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months from filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.

After the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Fast Track Designation

The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to use surrogate endpoints in the evaluation of the pivotal clinical trials and have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#8217;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Priority Review

Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is received. Products regulated by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA&#8217;s criteria for priority review.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

Accelerated Approval 

Under the FDA&#8217;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation

Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.

Orphan Drugs

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Qualified Infectious Disease Products

In response to the growing unmet medical need in the area of serious bacterial infections, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act became law in July 2012 and included the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act. The GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives, including, for example, access to expedited FDA review for approval and five years of potential market exclusivity extension, for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, or QIDP, including antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to treatment, or that treat qualifying resistant pathogens identified by the FDA. A sponsor must request QIDP designation for a new drug before an NDA is submitted and, if designated as a QIDP and approved, is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have otherwise been entitled. In addition, a QIDP receives NDA priority review and Fast Track designation.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an orphan drug designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

Other Regulatory Requirements

Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMs, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Additional Provisions

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.

The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

&#160;

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain re quirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of cove red entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties direct ly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal ci vil actions. 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities or marketing expenditures.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of therapies in which our products are used. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan by plan basis. One payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.

Healthcare Reform

Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.

&#160;

For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially change d healthcare financing and delivery by both governme ntal and private insurers, and significantly impact ed the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal g overnment&#8217;s comparative effectiveness research. &#160; Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to it in the future . 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

Foreign Regulation

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

New Legislation and Regulations

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.

Employees

As of February 29, 2016, we had 48 employees, 20 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 33 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 15 of whom were engaged in business development,
