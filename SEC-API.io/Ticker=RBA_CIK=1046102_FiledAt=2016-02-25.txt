 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

We are the world leader for the exchange of used equipment, completing over $4.2 billion of equipment transactions during 2015. Our expertise, global reach, market insight and trusted brand provide us with a unique and leading position in the used equipment market. We primarily sell equipment for our customers through unreserved auctions at 44 auction sites worldwide. In addition, during 2013 we commercially launched EquipmentOne, an online used equipment marketplace to reach a broader customer base. These two complementary exchange solutions provide different value propositions to equipment owners and allow us to meet the needs and preferences of a wide spectrum of equipment sellers.

&#160;

We focus on the sale of heavy machinery. Through our unreserved auctions and online marketplaces, we sell a broad range of used and unused industrial assets, including equipment, trucks and other assets used in the construction, transportation, agricultural, material handling, mining, forestry, energy and marine industries. The majority of the assets sold through our sales channels would be classified as construction machinery. We operate in over 15 countries worldwide. Our world headquarters are located near Vancouver, Canada.

&#160;

Our GAP represents the total proceeds from all items sold at our auctions and online marketplaces. Our GAP was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 1% increase from 2014.

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated was amalgamated on December 12, 1997 under, and is governed by, the Canada Business Corporation Act .

Multi-channel sales solutions and complementary services 

We offer a variety of sales solutions and complementary services that position us as the global leader in used equipment sales.

&#160;

Our multi-channel sales solutions allow sellers to choose the method of sale based on their needed degree of control. Our vision is to position appropriate solutions at each point of the seller journey, which is illustrated as follows, and connect them with quality buyers from a global marketplace:

Further, we believe that our services complement each other and allow us to provide our customers with a variety of options that are synergistically &#8216;Better Together&#8217;.

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers &#8212; our core unreserved auction business 

Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers is the world&#8217;s largest industrial auctioneer, and our core business is providing unreserved auction services to equipment buyers and sellers. Our adherence to the unreserved auction process is one of our founding principles and we believe one of our most significant competitive advantages. All Ritchie Bros. auctions are unreserved, meaning that there are no minimum bids or reserve prices on any item sold at our auctions. Each item is sold to the highest bidder, regardless of price. This process, combined with our global market reach, ensures that each item sold at our auctions is sold for global market value. In addition, consignors, or their agents, are not allowed to bid on or buy back or in any way influence the selling price of their own equipment. This policy provides a transparent environment for our auction bidders.

&#160;

Our bidders participate in our auctions in person, by proxy, or through real-time online bidding. Online participation in our auctions has increased steadily since that option was introduced in 2002. Most online bidders still visit our auction sites prior to the auction, in order to test and inspect the equipment being sold.

&#160;

Consignment volumes at our auctions are affected by a number of factors, including regular fleet upgrades and reconfigurations, financial pressure, retirements, and inventory reductions, as well as by the timing of the completion of major construction and other projects. We generally cannot influence the decision of an equipment owner whether to sell, but once they have made the decision to sell, our sales team&#8217;s opportunity is to demonstrate the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers value proposition and have the equipment contributed to one of our unreserved auctions.

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. 4 

&#160;

&#160;

Over 60% of our core auction GAP goes to buyers from outside the region of sale. Our ability to consistently draw significant numbers of local and international bidders from many different markets to our auctions, most of whom are end users rather than resellers, is appealing to sellers of used equipment and trucks and helps us to attract consignments to our auctions. Higher consignment volumes attract more bidders, which in turn attract more consignments, and so on in a self-reinforcing process that has helped us to achieve a history of significant growth and momentum in our business which is reflected in our core auction GAP growth.

&#160;

EquipmentOne &#8212; our online used equipment marketplace 

Ritchie Bros. commercially launched EquipmentOne (an Online Negotiation Engine) in 2013 to reach the segment of the used equipment transaction market that prefers to retain control over the sales process, while potentially taking on more effort. Through EquipmentOne ( www.equipmentone.com ), equipment sellers are able to list their equipment on the online marketplace, receive and accept offers, and complete and settle their sale.

&#160;

EquipmentOne is a secure online marketplace that equipment sellers can navigate independently, while still leveraging Ritchie Bros.&#8217; trusted brand and transaction processing. EquipmentOne facilitates the completion of sales through a settlement process that protects both the seller and the buyer. Once a sale is agreed upon, buyers are instructed to pay the purchase price of the sale to Ritchie Bros. to hold in escrow. When the funds are received, the seller is informed that they can release the sold equipment to the purchaser. When the purchaser provides approval to Ritchie Bros. that the equipment is as advertised, we then release the net sales proceeds to the seller.

&#160;

We still consider EquipmentOne to be in a start-up phase, and as such, we do not anticipate that this online marketplace will contribute materially to our overall operations for several years. However, we believe that there is a substantial growth opportunity for this business line, and so we continue to invest in EquipmentOne. In February 2016, we expanded our EquipmentOne offering from the United States into Canada.

&#160;

Private treaty services 

In 2015, we commercially launched our private treaty service, wherein we act as a private sales agent leveraging our global customer base and extensive heavy industry knowledge to conduct negotiated sales of specialized and high-value equipment items between buyers and sellers. Under this service offering, the seller sets the price and the completion timeline. To earn our commission from rendering private treaty services, we manage the entire sales process in accordance with the seller&#8217;s terms, including marketing the equipment to a global audience and settling the sale. With over 50 years of experience, we have the connections and expertise to identify and target the most qualified buyers from around the world for sellers&#8217; assets.

&#160;

Financial services 

In 2011, we launched RBFS, one of our subsidiaries that offers our buyers affordable, flexible equipment financing. RBFS brokers with select lenders to provide buyers with the best rates and low monthly payments. We feel that as a result of this financing service, we are able to increase the number of buyers at our auctions, and in turn, attract a greater number of consignors as well.

&#160;

Technology services 

In November 2015, we acquired a controlling interest in Xcira LLC (&#8220;Xcira&#8221;), a Florida-based company specializing in the provision of software and technology solutions to auction companies in order to allow those companies to conduct live, online bidding. By acquiring Xcira, we are able to invest in further custom projects to cater to the unique needs of our customers in order to build on our strong online bidding customer experience and further differentiate Ritchie Bros. from other industrial auction companies. Over the past 14 years, we have worked closely with Xcira to customize Xcira&#8217;s solution to meet our needs. While we are the exclusive industrial auctioneer customer of Xcira, Xcira offers its solutions to many other auction companies including those in the luxury items, art, and auto markets.

History and Development of Our Business 

Our company was founded in 1958 in the small town of Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. We held our first major industrial auction in 1963, selling over $600,000 worth of construction equipment in Radium, British Columbia. While our early auction sales were held primarily in Western Canada, Ritchie Bros. expanded eastward in Canada through the 1960s.

&#160;

By 1970, we had established operations in the United States and held our first American sale in Beaverton, Oregon. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, we held auctions in additional locations across Canada and an increasing number of American states. In 1987, we held our first European auctions in Liverpool, United Kingdom and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Our first Australian auction was held in 1990, and this was followed by expansion into Asia, with subsequent sales in Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore. We held our first Mexican auction in 1995 and our first Middle Eastern auction in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 1997.

&#160;

Although we expect that most of our growth in the near future will come from expanding our business and increasing our penetration in regions where we already have a presence, such as the United States and Western Europe, we believe that emerging markets such as China offer significant potential for growth in the long-term.

&#160;

In 1994, we introduced our prototype auction facility, opening new permanent auction sites in Fort Worth, Texas and Olympia, Washington that represented significant improvements over the facilities being used at the time by other industrial equipment auctioneers. We have since constructed similar facilities in various locations in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Europe, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. We have 44 auction sites at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

In March 1998, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares. Our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (&#8220;TSX&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;RBA&#8221;.

&#160;

On May 15, 2012, we purchased AssetNation, an online marketplace and solutions provider for surplus and salvage assets based in the United States. Leveraging AssetNation&#8217;s technology and e-commerce expertise in early 2013 we commercially launched our new online marketplace, EquipmentOne.

&#160;

On November 4, 2015, we acquired a 75% interest in Xcira, a proven leader in simulcast auction technology that provides a seamless customer experience for integrated on site and online auctions. Through this acquisition, we secured Xcira&#8217;s bidding technology, which represents a significant and growing portion of all bidding conducted at our auctions.

&#160;

On February 19, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Mascus International Holding B.V. (&#8220;Mascus&#8221;) for a provisional purchase price of 24.0 million Euros ($26.6 million) subject to working capital adjustments under the terms of the agreement. Mascus is an Amsterdam-based company that operates a global online portal for the sale and purchase of heavy equipment and vehicles. Additional cash compensation, totaling no more than 3.4 million Euros ($3.8 million), may be provided to Mascus&#8217; former shareholders, contingent upon certain operating performance targets being achieved over the next three years.

&#160; 

The Used Equipment Market Opportunity 

Ritchie Bros. is the well-established world leader for used equipment sales. Our market position, in itself, is a competitive advantage. As we sell more used equipment than anyone else, we attract the largest audience of interested used equipment buyers. This in turn attracts more equipment sellers. This cycle continues to bolster our growth, which is demonstrated by our long history of expansion.

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. 6 

&#160;

&#160;

We recently updated our estimate of the annual global used equipment market, through a review of the construction, transportation and agricultural used equipment markets. Based on this review, we believe the global used equipment market is valued at approximately $360 billion. The market is highly fragmented, and we believe we are the largest player in the unreserved auction market space. We compete with other sellers of used equipment on the basis of breadth, brand reputation, security, and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment.

&#160;

The volume of used equipment transactions is affected by the ongoing production of new equipment and trucks, the demand for equipment, the rate of equipment utilization and the motivations of equipment owners to realign and replace their fleets. Our goal is to capture a greater proportion of the transactions through our multi-channel strategy. Our businesses generate revenue based on a percent of the selling price of goods sold through our sales channels. As such, influences on used equipment pricing can affect corporate performance. Factors such as regional or global economic and construction activity, the supply of good quality used equipment, availability of low-cost financing and changes to regional regulations can affect the demand for, and therefore price of, equipment sold through our auctions and our online marketplace.

&#160;

Competitive Advantages 

Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term. Our GAP has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9.0% over the last 25 years, as illustrated below.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Reputation for conducting unreserved auctions 

We believe that our widely known commitment to fair dealing and the unreserved auction process is a key contributor to our growth and success. All of our auctions are unreserved, meaning that there are no minimum bids or reserve prices; each and every item is sold to the highest bidder on the day of the auction regardless of the price. Consignors are prohibited by contract from bidding on their own consigned items at the auction or in any way artificially affecting the auction results. Bidders at our auctions have confidence that if they are the highest bidder on an item, then they are the buyer of that item, regardless of price. We believe that Ritchie Bros.&#8217; reputation for conducting only unreserved auctions is a major reason why bidders are willing to commit the necessary time and effort to participate in our auctions, and we believe that the size and breadth of the resulting bidding audiences enables us generally to achieve higher prices than our competitors.

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. 7 

&#160;

&#160;

Ability to transcend local market conditions 

We market each auction to a global customer base of potential bidders, through the use of digital media, print media and the internet. Because bidders are willing to travel between regions and countries to attend our auctions, and are able to participate over the internet if they are unable or choose not to attend in person, consignors have confidence that they will receive the world market price for their equipment. In recent periods, an average of approximately 60% of the value of equipment sold at any particular auction has left the region of the sale.

&#160;

International scope 

We have substantial expertise in marketing, assembling and conducting auctions in international markets. We have conducted auctions in more than 20 countries and we regularly hold auctions in North America, Central America, Europe, Australia, Asia and the Middle East.

&#160;

Extensive network of auction sites 

Our international network of auction sites is attractive to consignors of trucks and equipment with widely dispersed fleets and also to manufacturers wanting to access multiple regional markets. We believe that our network of auction sites has allowed us to achieve economies of scale by holding more frequent and larger auctions at our existing facilities, thereby taking advantage of our considerable operating capacity without incurring significant incremental costs. In addition, many of our auction sites are equipped with state-of-the-art painting and refurbishing facilities which, together with purpose-built auction theatres and equipment display yards, allow us to deliver a uniquely high level of service to our customers. Our secure yards enable our bidders to inspect, test and compare assets available for sale at our auctions, and give them confidence that the assets on which they are bidding exist and will be in the same condition when they pick them up as they were when they purchased them. Our consignors take comfort knowing their assets are under our care, custody and control, and that we are looking after all details in connection with the auction, including load-out by buyers.

&#160;

Proprietary databases 

We maintain sophisticated databases containing information on several million pieces of equipment sold around the world, detailed information regarding new equipment prices and listings of stolen equipment. Together with our unique and comprehensive information about the flow of equipment coming to market, these databases help us to identify market trends and estimate equipment values.

&#160;

We also maintain a proprietary customer information database containing detailed information on users of our online bidding service, including each customer&#8217;s auction attendance, trade association memberships, buying habits and other information. This database enables us to identify customers who might be interested in the equipment being sold at any particular auction.

&#160;

Internet services 

Online bidding at live auctions 

We believe that our extensive internet presence and the tools available on our website are valuable to buyers and sellers of equipment and represent a distinct competitive advantage for Ritchie Bros. Our online bidding service, provided by Xcira, has enhanced our ability to transcend local market conditions and offer international scope to equipment buyers and sellers at our auctions. It has also increased the number of bidders participating in our auctions, which we believe has led to higher selling prices.

&#160;

Through the use of Xcira&#8217;s online bidding technology, we launched our internet bidding service in 2002. In 2015 we sold over $1.8 billion of equipment to users of this service. In 2015, customers bidding in our live industrial auctions over the internet accounted for over 60% of total industrial auction registrations. Our internet bidding service gives our auction customers the choice of how they want to do business with us and access to both live and online auction participation. The average number of registered bidders, both online and on-site, participating in our industrial auctions has increased 103% to 2,192 registered bidders in 2015 from 1,080 bidders in 2001, prior to the implementation our internet bidding service. In November 2015 we secured our online bidding technology by acquiring a controlling interest in Xcira.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Online sales through a secure and trusted marketplace 

In 2013, we launched our online equipment marketplace, EquipmentOne ( www.equipmentone.com ), which provides equipment sellers with control over the selling price and the sales process. EquipmentOne appeals to equipment sellers who want to manage the process, decide if and when to sell, and negotiate a selling price. This optionality appeals to companies and equipment owners who would prefer to sell only under certain conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2015, average monthly users of our EquipmentOne websites totaled 108,579, an 11% increase compared to 98,187 in the fourth quarter of 2014.

&#160;

Search engine optimization 

In 2010 we launched our new 21-language Ritchie Bros. website, with enhanced features such as high quality zoomable photos, watch lists and other valuable features. The website ( www.rbauction.com ) now enables customers to interact with us more easily, as well as search for and purchase the equipment they need, and we believe it is a powerful tool for attracting new non-English speaking customers. As at December 31, 2015, the average monthly users of our Ritchie Bros. website totaled 934,290, a 14% increase compared to 822,718 on December 31, 2014, which itself was a 31% increase compared to 626,815 on December 31, 2013.

&#160;

In 2011 we launched our detailed equipment information program, in which we provide free of charge on our website to all customers much more detailed information and photos about the equipment to be sold at our auctions. We believe this program is allowing customers to shop with greater ease and bid with more confidence, and has made our auctions more appealing to a broader range of equipment owners.

&#160;

Size and financial resources 

In addition to being the world&#8217;s largest auctioneer of industrial equipment, we believe that we sell more used trucks and equipment than any other company, including non-auction companies such as manufacturers, dealers and brokers, making us the largest participant in this highly fragmented market. In addition to our strong market position, we have the financial resources to offer our consignors flexible contract options such as guarantee and inventory contracts, as well as to expand into new industries and geographies.

&#160;

Our size and financial resources also enable us to invest in new technologies and services, including but not limited to the following:

&#160;

&#183; EquipmentOne &#8211; online sales marketplace services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; RBFS &#8211; financing services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Private treaty &#8211; broker services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Ritchie Bros. Logistics &#8211; full-service shipping and logistics solutions &#160; &#160; &#183; Xcira &#8211; online auction bidding technology services &#160; 

Dedicated and experienced workforce 

Our sales and support team is a key part of our customer service effort. We had 1,522 full-time employees at December 31, 2015, including 342 Revenue Producers 2 and 31 Trainee Territory Managers, which are sales personnel enrolled in our comprehensive training program to enhance their sales skills and develop them into high-producing Territory Managers.

&#160;

&#160;

2 Revenue Producers is a term used to describe our revenue producing sales personnel. This definition is comprised of Regional Sales Managers and Territory Managers. &#160;

Ritchie Bros. 9 

&#160;

&#160;

These competitive advantages have enabled us to hold successful auctions that are appealing to both buyers and consignors, as evidenced by the growth in the number of buyers and consignors participating in our auctions, set out in the graph below, and the resulting growth in our GAP.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe that this momentum, together with our reputation, size and financial resources, gives our customers confidence in our auction services, which should contribute to our growth over the long term.

&#160; 

Strategy 

Over the past several years our strategy has continued to evolve. During 2014 we updated our strategy to outline the following objectives, strategic pillars and key enablers:

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

There are three main drivers to our strategy and roadmap to generate shareholder value:

&#160;

&#160;

Ritchie Bros. 10 

&#160;

&#160;

GROW Revenue and Earnings 

We are committed to pursuing growth initiatives that will further enhance our sector reach, drive geographic depth, meet a broader set of customer needs, and add scale to our operations. EquipmentOne is a key part of a full-service offering to provide our customers with a menu of options that cater to their needs at different points of their asset disposition journey. This &#8220; Better Together &#8221; strategy of offering EquipmentOne alongside our core auction services is a key step in developing a truly multi-channel offering to our market. In addition, we will focus on accelerating our strategic accounts growth and improving the overall performance and use of our underwritten commission contracts.

&#160;

DRIVE Efficiencies and Effectiveness 

We plan to take advantage of opportunities to improve the overall effectiveness of our organization by enhancing sales productivity, modernizing and integrating our legacy IT systems and optimizing business processes. We are also implementing formal performance measurement metrics (such as a Performance Scorecard ) to gauge our effectiveness and progress, and will better align our executive compensation plans with our new strategy and key targets. We are also better aligning our organizational structure to help us more effectively meet the needs of our customers in each of our regions. We believe this will enhance the agility of our organization, and our decision making processes, to better serve our customers.

&#160;

OPTIMIZE our Balance Sheet 

Our business model provides us with the ability to generate strong cash flows. Cash flow represents our ability to convert revenue into cash, and provides a meaningful indication of the strength inherent in our business. We will focus not only on profit growth but also cash flow growth, reviewing each site in order to improve returns on a location-by-location basis within our core auction segment. The majority of our sites meet these return expectations and some are significantly exceeding them.

&#160;

A more detailed outline of our strategy is as follows:

&#160;

Segmented Information 

Segmented information is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Operations 

In 2015, approximately 85% of our GAP was attributable to auctions held at our permanent auction sites and regional auction sites, compared to 86% in 2014 and 2013. Please see further discussion below under &#8220;Item 2. Properties &#8211; international network of auction sites&#8221; for a discussion of our properties.

&#160;

In 2015 and 2014, 12% of our GAP came from &#8220;off-site&#8221; auctions, compared to 11% in 2013. Off-site auctions are typically held on rented or consignor-owned land. The decision as to whether to hold a particular auction at one of our sites instead of at an off-site location is influenced by the nature, amount and location of the equipment to be sold. The majority of our agricultural auctions are held at off-site locations, usually on the consignor&#8217;s farm.

&#160;

The remainder of our GAP was primarily attributable to the Gross Transaction Value (&#8220;GTV&#8221;) of all items sold through EquipmentOne. GTV represents total proceeds from all items sold at our online marketplaces, as well as a buyers&#8217; premium component applicable only to our online marketplace transactions.

&#160;

Our GAP and associated revenues are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. Our GAP and revenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than in the first and third calendar quarters. We believe that revenues are best understood by considering their relationship to GAP. We use Revenue Rate, which is calculated by dividing revenues by GAP, to determine the amount of GAP changes that flow through to our revenues.

&#160;

Some of the key elements of our auction process include:

&#160;

&#160;

3 Operating Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our consolidated financial statements under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. &#160;

Ritchie Bros. 12 

&#160;

&#160;

Attracting bidders 

We believe our proprietary customer database, which contains over 584,500 customer names from approximately 195 countries, significantly enhances our ability to market our auctions effectively. We typically send tens of thousands of print and digital direct marketing materials to strategically selected customers from our database as part of our comprehensive auction marketing service. We also conduct targeted regional and industry-specific advertising and marketing campaigns and use social media to generate awareness. In addition, we present information about the majority of the consigned equipment at upcoming auctions on our website so that potential bidders can review equipment descriptions and view photographs of many of the items to be sold. We had over 507,200 bidder registrations at our industrial auctions in 2015 compared to approximately 463,500 in 2014 and 424,700 in 2013.

&#160;

Attracting equipment 

We solicit equipment consignments ranging from single pieces of equipment consigned by local owner-operators to large equipment fleets offered by multi-national consortiums upon the completion of major construction projects.

&#160;

For larger consignments, our service typically begins with an equipment appraisal that gives the prospective consignor a credible estimate of the value of the appraised equipment. We believe that consignors choosing to sell their equipment at auctions choose Ritchie Bros. over other auctioneers, because they believe that selling at a Ritchie Bros. global auction is the best way to maximize the net proceeds on the sale of their assets.

&#160;

Our willingness to take consignment of a customer&#8217;s full equipment fleet, including ancillary assets such as inventories, parts, tools, attachments and construction materials, rather than only accepting selected items, is another valuable service that we offer to consignors that sets us apart from most of our competitors.

&#160;

Attractive contract options 

We offer consignors several contract options to meet their individual needs and sale objectives. These can include a straight commission contract, where the consignor receives the gross proceeds from the sale less a pre-negotiated commission rate, as well as alternate arrangements including guarantee contracts (where the consignor receives a guaranteed minimum amount plus an additional amount if proceeds exceed a specified level) or inventory contracts (where we purchase the equipment temporarily for resale). We refer to guarantee and inventory contracts as underwritten commission contracts, which accounted for approximately 29% of our GAP in 2015, compared to 31% in 2014 and 28% in 2013.

&#160;

In order to assist customers with their equipment transactions and to build our business and position ourselves in the marketplace, in a minority of cases, we will strategically present proposals to customers that include underwritten commission contracts. In making the decision to strategically use an underwritten proposal, we consider a multitude of factors, including, the size and the mix of the equipment in the proposal, the condition of the equipment, the timing of the contract in relation to a particular auction and its impact on attracting additional consignments, the competitive environment, our ability to build our market share and the relationship with the customer. We have a rigorous approach to appraising and evaluating the items included in a potential underwritten deal and have a well-developed, strict internal approval process for entering into underwritten commission contracts.

&#160;

Further, the choice by equipment owners between straight commission, guarantee, or inventory contracts, if presented by us, depends on the owner&#8217;s risk tolerance and sale objectives. We work with our customers to provide them with the contract option that best suits their needs at that point in time. As a result, the mix of contracts in a particular quarter or year fluctuates and is not necessarily indicative of the mix in future periods. The composition of our auction commissions and our Revenue Rate are affected by the mix and performance of contracts entered into with consignors in the particular period and fluctuates from period to period.

&#160;

Value-added services 

We provide a wide array of services to make the auction process convenient for buyers and sellers of equipment. Examples of these services include:

&#183; conducting title searches, where registries are commercially available, to ensure equipment is sold free and clear of all liens and encumbrances (if we are not able to deliver clear title, we provide a full refund up to the purchase price to the buyer); &#160;

Online bidding and equipment marketplace purchase metrics 

We continue to see an increase in the use and popularity of both our online bidding system and our online equipment marketplace. During 2015, we attracted record annual online bidder registrations and sold approximately $1.9 billion of equipment, trucks and other assets to online auction bidders and EquipmentOne customers. This represents an 8% increase over the $1.8 billion of assets sold online in 2014, and an annual online sales record. In 2014, we sold 18% more assets to online bidders and EquipmentOne customers than the $1.5 billion sold in 2013.

&#160;

Productivity 

To support our revenue-producing sales personnel, we follow a dual marketing strategy, promoting Ritchie Bros. and the unreserved auction process in general, as well as marketing specific auctions and listings in our EquipmentOne marketplace. This dual strategy is designed to attract both consignors and bidders to our sales solutions. Our advertising and promotional efforts include the use of trade journals and magazines and attendance at numerous trade shows held around the world. We also participate in international, national and local trade associations. Digital marketing, social media and our Ritchie Bros. website are other important components of our marketing effort.

&#160;

In addition to regional marketing through our sales representatives, we market through our national accounts team to large multi-national customers, including rental companies, manufacturers and finance companies, who have equipment disposition requirements in various regions and countries and can therefore benefit from our international network of auction sites.

&#160;

Competition 

The global used industrial equipment market, including the auction segment of that market, is highly fragmented. We compete for potential purchasers and sellers of industrial equipment with other auction companies and with non-auction competitors such as equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers, equipment rental companies, and other online marketplaces. When sourcing equipment to sell at our auctions or through EquipmentOne, we compete with other auction companies, dealers and brokers, and equipment owners who have traditionally disposed of equipment through private sales.

&#160;

Governmental regulations and environmental laws 

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations throughout the world relating to, among other things, the auction business, imports and exports of equipment, worker health and safety, privacy of customer information and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. In addition, our development or expansion of auction sites depends upon the receipt of required licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations, and we are subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction sites, which vary among jurisdictions.

&#160;

Under some of the laws regulating the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, an owner or lessee of, or other person involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee or other person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.

&#160;

We typically obtain Phase I environmental assessment reports prepared by independent environmental consultants in connection with our site acquisitions and leases. A Phase I environmental assessment consists of a site visit, historical record review, interviews and reports, with the purpose of identifying potential environmental conditions associated with the subject property. There can be no assurance, however, that acquired or leased sites have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of environmental liability upon us or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. Although we have insurance to protect us from such liability, there can also be no assurance that it will cover any or all potential losses.

&#160;

There are restrictions in the United States and Europe that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions. One example of these restrictions is environmental certification requirements in the United States, which prevent non-certified equipment from being entered into commerce in the United States. In addition, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those markets. We expect these emission standards to be implemented in additional jurisdictions or to be strengthened in existing jurisdictions in the future.

&#160;

We are committed to contributing to the protection of the natural environment by preventing and reducing adverse impacts of our operations. As part of our commitment, we aim to:

&#160;

&#183; empower our employees to identify and address environmental issues; &#160;

&#183; consider environmental impacts as part of all business decisions; &#160;

&#183; conduct business in compliance with applicable regulations and legislation, and where appropriate, adopt the most stringent standards as our global benchmark; &#160;

&#183; use resources wisely and efficiently to minimize our environmental impact; &#160;

&#183; communicate transparently with our stakeholders about environmental matters; &#160;

&#183; conduct ongoing assessments to ensure compliance and good stewardship; and &#160;

&#183; hold management accountable for providing leadership on environmental matters, achieving targets, and providing education to employees. &#160;

We believe that by following these principles, we will be able to achieve our objective to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and make a positive contribution to the protection of the natural environment.

&#160;

Our operational and marketing activities are subject to various types of regulations, including laws relating to the protection of personal information, consumer protection and competition. For example, the Canadian Anti-Spam Law (&#8220;CASL&#8221;) came into force on July 1, 2014. CASL prohibits the transmission of commercial electronic messages to an email address without consent and it also requires certain formalities to be complied with, including the ability to unsubscribe easily from subsequent messages.

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements that affect our business, and that compliance with such laws, rules, regulations and requirements does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct our business.
