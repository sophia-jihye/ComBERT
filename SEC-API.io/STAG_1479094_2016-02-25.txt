 Item 1. Business 

As used herein, except where the context otherwise requires, &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us,&#8221; refer to STAG Industrial, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships, including our operating partnership, &#32; STAG Industrial Operating Partnership, L.P. (&#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;). &#32; As used herein,&#8220;annualized base rental revenue&#8221; refers to the contractual monthly base rent as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(which differs from rent calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)) multiplied by 12. If a tenant is in a free rent period as of December 31, 2015 , the annualized rent is calculated based on the first contractual monthly base rent amount multiplied by 12. 

Overview 

We focus on the acquisition and operation of single-tenant industrial properties throughout the United States. We (i) identify properties that create relative value investments across all locations, industries and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 291 &#32;buildings in 38 &#32;states with approximately 54.7 million rentable square feet, consisting of 223 &#32;warehouse/distribution buildings, 47 &#32;light manufacturing buildings and 21 &#32;flex/office buildings. As of December 31, 2015 , our buildings were approximately 95.6% &#32;leased to 266 &#32;tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 3.3% &#32;of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 12.2% &#32;of our total annualized base rental revenue. We intend to maintain a diversified mix of tenants to limit our exposure to any single tenant. 

The industrial property market in the United States is a large and fragmented market that we believe offers sustainable acquisition opportunities throughout all phases of the economic cycle. We estimate that our target market of single-tenant, industrial properties anticipated to satisfy our investment criteria to be approximately $250 billion or more. Based on this estimate, our current share of our target market is less than 1%. We have a fully-integrated acquisition, leasing and asset management platform, and our senior management team has a significant amount of single-tenant, industrial real estate experience. 

Our mission is to continue to be a disciplined, relative value investor and a leading owner and operator of single-tenant, industrial properties in the United States. We seek to deliver attractive stockholder returns in all market environments by providing a covered dividend combined with accretive growth. 

We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;STAG.&#8221; We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, also known as an UPREIT, and own all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership, which we control and manage. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned approximately 95.1% &#32;of the common equity of our Operating Partnership, and our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common equity in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 4.9% . We completed our initial public offering of common stock (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) and related formation transactions, pursuant to which we succeeded to the business of our predecessor, on April 20, 2011. 

Our Investment Thesis 

We believe that our focus on owning and operating a portfolio of individually-acquired, single-tenant industrial properties throughout the United States will, when compared to other real estate portfolios, generate returns for our stockholders that are attractive in light of the associated risks for the following reasons: 

&#8226; 

Buyers tend to price an individual, single-tenant, industrial property according to the binary nature of its cash flows: with only one potential tenant, any one property is either generating revenue or not. Furthermore, tenants typically cover operating expenses at a property and when a property is not generating revenue, we, as owners, are responsible for paying these expenses. We believe the market prices these properties based upon a higher risk profile due to the single-tenant nature of these properties and therefore applies a lower value relative to a diversified cash flowing investment. 

&#8226; 

The acquisition and contribution of these single-tenant properties to an aggregated portfolio of these individual binary risk cash flows creates diversification, lowering risk and thereby creating value. 

&#8226; 

Industrial properties generally require less capital expenditure than other commercial property types and single-tenant properties generally require less expenditure for leasing, operating and capital costs per property than multi-tenant properties. 

&#8226; 

Other institutional, industrial real estate buyers tend to focus on larger properties and portfolios in a select few primary markets. In contrast, we focus on smaller, individual properties across many markets; as a result, our typical competitors are local investors who often do not have the same access to debt or equity capital as us. In our fragmented, predominantly non-institutional environment, a sophisticated, institutional platform with access to capital has execution and operational advantages. 

&#8226; 

Tenants in our target properties tend to manage the day-to-day operational aspects of their properties directly, which allows us to grow our portfolio without increasing the size of our asset management infrastructure on a linear basis to our portfolio. 

While we invest in properties in all locations, our proprietary risk assessment model typically identifies the best relative value in primary and secondary markets. We define primary markets as the 29 largest industrial metropolitan areas, which each have approximately 200 million or more in net rentable square footage. We define secondary industrial markets as the markets which each have net rentable square footage ranging from approximately 25 million to approximately 200 million. We define tertiary markets as markets with less than 25 million square feet of net rentable square footage. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our investments in primary, secondary, and tertiary markets are summarized in the table below.

We have found, and the charts below indicate, that primary and secondary markets have similar occupancy and rent growth experiences. Furthermore, secondary industrial property markets generally provide less rent volatility and equivalent occupancy, compared to primary industrial property markets. The tables below, based on data provided by CB Richard Ellis&#8212;Econometric Advisors (&#8220;CBRE-EA&#8221;), show the quarter-over-quarter (&#8220;Q-o-Q&#8221;) percentage changes in warehouse rent and occupancy for primary and secondary markets. 

Our Strategies 

Our primary business objectives are to own and operate a balanced and diversified portfolio of binary risk investments (individual single-tenant industrial properties) that maximize cash flows available for distribution to our stockholders, and to enhance stockholder value over time by achieving sustainable long-term growth in distributable cash flow from operations per share through the following strategies. 

External Growth Strategy 

We focus our acquisition activities (assuming our market opportunity remains attractive) on our core property types: warehouse/distribution facilities and light manufacturing facilities. From time to time, if an attractive opportunity presents itself, we may consider portfolio acquisitions. 

Underwriting Strategy 

We blend fundamental real estate analysis with corporate credit analysis in our proprietary model to make a probabilistic assessment of future cash flows. We focus on quality real estate and long-term ownership. 

Our underwriting strategy involves our asset management and leasing, credit, capital markets and legal departments. For each asset, our analysis focuses on the following, which we input into our risk assessment model: 

&#8226; 

Asset Management and Leasing . We evaluate the physical real estate within the context of the market (and submarket) in which it is located and the prospect for re-tenanting the building if it becomes vacant by estimating the following: 

&#8226; 

current and future market rent for this building in this location; 

&#8226; 

downtime to re-lease and related carrying costs; 

&#8226; 

cost (tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital expenditures) to achieve the occupancy and the projected market rent within the projected downtime; and 

&#8226; 

the fungibility of the property with other properties in the market and the flexibility of the property for other uses, including single-tenant or multi-tenant reuse. 

&#8226; 

Renewal probability, which we determine by the tenant&#8217;s use of the property and the degree to which the property is central to the tenant&#8217;s ongoing operations, the tenant&#8217;s potential cost to relocate, the supply/demand dynamic in the relevant submarket and the availability of suitable alternative properties. 

&#8226; 

Credit. We apply fundamental credit analysis to evaluate the tenant&#8217;s credit profile by focusing on the tenant&#8217;s current and historical financial status, general business plan, operating risks, capital sources, industry trends, and earnings expectations. We also analyze Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) filings, press releases, tenant management calls, rating agency reports, macroeconomic variables, analyst reports, and market signals. In the case of a private, non&#8209;rated firm, we will generally obtain financial information from the tenant, calculate common measures of credit strength and coverage ratios, evaluate qualitative factors including but not limited to competition and customer/supplier concentration, obtain third party references, and conduct tenant interviews. For publicly rated firms, we use our own internal underwriting model, as well as the credit information issued by Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch Ratings. Using this data and publicly available bond default studies of comparable tenant credits, we estimate the probability of future rent loss due to tenant default, as well as the possibility of a reorganization or liquidation in the case of a tenant default or bankruptcy event. 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets. We evaluate the leverage levels, credit spreads, and costs associated with the capital used to fund the proposed acquisition. In addition, we estimate future inflation rates and interest rates. 

&#8226; 

Legal. We evaluate transaction documents, the tenant and landlord obligations contained within the existing or proposed leases, and other legal issues associated with the building, such as zoning, encroachments and environmental conditions. 

For our portfolio as a whole, we use risk management guidelines to ensure diversification by tenant, industry, lease term and geography. 

Real Estate Operation Strategy 

We establish direct, long-term relationships with our tenants and use our in-house expertise in asset management and leasing to manage all operational aspects of our portfolio. We also engage and actively manage high-quality third parties for localized leasing, property management, and construction services. Our asset management team utilizes our direct tenant relationships and leasing expertise to strive to achieve better than market levels of occupancy and rental rates. We utilize third party real estate brokers for the execution of new leases; however, we typically manage the renewal of leases with our tenants directly, thereby reducing the amount of leasing commissions paid. The team also collaborates with our internal credit function to monitor the credit profile of 

each of our tenants through financial statement review, tenant management calls, and press releases. The team&#8217;s efforts have resulted in our achieving a tenant retention rate of approximately 70% &#32;for those tenants whose leases were scheduled to expire since our IPO in 2011. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio had approximately 4.4% &#32;of our total rentable square feet, available for lease, compared to 5.2% as of December 31, 2014 . 

We continually evaluate dispositions on an opportunistic basis by evaluating tenants, property locations, and asset class. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we reviewed our portfolio and identified several properties for potential disposition. We reviewed our current properties for disposition to realize value created in the portfolio and enhance the quality of the portfolio by disposing of underperforming assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we sold six &#32;industrial buildings consisting of approximately 0.8 million &#32;square feet for a net gain of approximately $5.0 million . 

Financing Strategy 

Our main focus is to preserve a flexible capital structure and maintain a relatively low-leveraged balance sheet designed to allow us to capitalize on market opportunities throughout the economic cycle. We seek to &#160; maintain a conservative balance sheet and we achieve this by capitalizing new acquisitions with 60% equity and 40% debt. As of December 31, 2015 , our ratio of net debt to real estate cost basis was approximately 45% &#32;and our ratio of total long-term indebtedness to enterprise value was approximately 40% . For purposes of these ratios, we define: 

&#8226; 

&#8220;net debt&#8221; as our total long-term indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents on hand; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;long-term indebtedness&#8221; as our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes and mortgage notes; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;real estate cost basis&#8221; as the book value of rental property, exclusive of the related accumulated depreciation and amortization; and 

&#8226; 

&#8220;enterprise value&#8221; as the market value of our common stock (based on the period-end closing price on the NYSE) plus the liquidation value of our preferred stock plus our long-term indebtedness. 

We raise capital through equity offerings, including discrete marketed offerings and ongoing &#8220;at the market&#8221; (&#8220;ATM&#8221;) offerings, and through unsecured debt offerings such as bank borrowings and private placement issuances. We believe unsecured indebtedness is generally more efficient and less restrictive operationally than secured indebtedness. We continue to utilize our ATM program as our primary source of equity capital when required and available. As a supplement to the ATM activity, we have also executed marketed overnight equity offerings. From time to time, we issue common units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership to acquire properties from owners who desire a tax-deferred transaction. 

Management Team and Personnel 

We have a fully integrated, highly experienced management team, and a majority of our senior management team has two or more decades of single-tenant, industrial real estate experience. 

Regulation 

General 

Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that we and/or our tenants, as applicable, have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined under the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in our portfolio in the aggregate substantially comply with current requirements of the ADA, and we have not received any notice for correction from any regulatory agency, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine whether we are in compliance and therefore we may own properties that are not in compliance with the ADA. 

ADA compliance is dependent upon the tenant&#8217;s specific use of the property, and as the use of a property changes or improvements to existing spaces are made, we will take steps to ensure compliance. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in additional costs to attain compliance, imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages or attorney&#8217;s fees to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations to achieve compliance as necessary. 

Environmental Matters 

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, as owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated, and therefore it is possible we could incur these costs even after we sell some of our properties. In addition to the costs of cleanup, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner&#8217;s ability to borrow using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under applicable environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment. We invest in properties historically used for industrial, light manufacturing and commercial purposes. Certain of our properties are on or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others, including former owners or tenants of our properties have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may generate or release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. 

Environmental laws in the United States also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our buildings are known to have asbestos containing materials, and others, due to the age of the building and observed conditions, are suspected of having asbestos containing materials. We do not believe these conditions will materially and adversely affect us. In most or all instances, no immediate action was recommended to address the conditions. 

Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos at one of our properties may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used. 

We could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our shareholders. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessment by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. We generally expect to continue to obtain a Phase I or similar environmental assessment by independent environmental consultants on each property prior to acquiring it. However, these environmental assessments may not reveal all environmental costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities. 

At the time of acquisition, we add each property to our portfolio environmental insurance policy that provides coverage for potential environmental liabilities, subject to the policy&#8217;s coverage conditions and limitations. 

We can make no assurances that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants, the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy. In addition, we maintain a portfolio environmental insurance policy that provides coverage for potential environmental liabilities, subject to the policy&#8217;s coverage conditions and limitations. Generally, we do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by floods (unless the property is located in a flood plain), earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots. We carry employment practices liability insurance that covers us against claims by employees, former employees or potential employees for various employment related matters including wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, hostile work environment, and retaliation, subject to the policy&#8217;s coverage conditions and limitations. We carry comprehensive cyber liability insurance coverage that covers us against claims related to certain first party and third party losses including data restoration costs, crisis management expenses, credit monitoring 

costs, failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures, invasion of customer&#8217;s privacy and negligence, subject to the policy&#8217;s coverage conditions and limitations. We also carry directors and officers insurance. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and standard industry practice; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. 

Competition 

In acquiring our target properties, we compete primarily with local individuals or local operators due to the single asset (versus portfolio) focus of our acquisition strategy. From time to time we compete with other public industrial property sector REITs, single-tenant REITs, income oriented non-traded REITs, and private real estate funds. Local real estate investors historically have represented our predominant competition for deals and they typically do not have the same access to capital that we do as a publicly traded institution. We also face significant competition from owners and managers of competing properties in leasing our properties to prospective tenants and in re-leasing space to existing tenants. 

Operating Segments 

We manage our operations on an aggregated, single segment basis for purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions, and accordingly, have only one reporting and operating segment. See Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under &#8220;Segment Reporting.&#8221; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 68 &#32;full-time employees. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 

Our Corporate Structure 

We were incorporated in Maryland on July 21, 2010, and our Operating Partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on December 21, 2009. 

We are structured as an UPREIT; our publicly-traded entity, STAG Industrial, Inc., is the REIT in the UPREIT structure, and our Operating Partnership is the umbrella partnership. We own a majority, but not all, of the Operating Partnership. We also wholly own the sole general partner (the manager) of the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held in, and substantially all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Shares of our common stock are listed and traded on the NYSE. The limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which we sometimes refer to as &#8220;units,&#8221; are not and cannot be publicly traded, although they may provide liquidity through an exchange feature described below. Our UPREIT structure allows us to acquire a property from an owner on a tax-deferred basis by issuing units in exchange for the property. 

The common units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership correlate on a one-for-one economic basis to the shares of common stock in the REIT. Each common unit in the Operating Partnership receives the same distribution as a share of our common stock, the value of each common unit is tied to the value of a share of our common stock and each common unit, after one year, generally may be redeemed (that is, exchanged) for a cash payment in an amount equivalent to the value of a share of common stock or, if we choose, for a share of common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

The following is a simplified diagram of our UPREIT structure at December 31, 2015 .
