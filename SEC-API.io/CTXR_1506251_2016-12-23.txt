Overview 

&#160;

Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Citius&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) headquartered in Cranford, New Jersey, is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of critical care products targeting important medical needs with a focus on anti-infective products, adjunctive cancer care, and unique prescription products. Our goal is to achieve leading market positions in our targeted markets by providing therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs. New formulations of previously approved drugs with substantial safety and efficacy data is a core focus as we seek to reduce development and clinical risks associated with drug development. Our strategy keys on products that have intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protection, while providing competitive advantages over other existing therapeutic approaches.

&#160;

The Company was founded as Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, on January 23, 2007. On September 12, 2014, Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC entered into a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, with Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Trail One, Inc.), a publicly traded company incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citius. On March 30, 2016, Citius acquired Leonard-Meron Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;LMB&#8221;) as a wholly-owned subsidiary. LMB was a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of critical care products with a concentration on anti-infectives.

&#160;

Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital. We are developing two proprietary products: Mino-Lok TM , an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections by salvaging the infected catheter, and a Hydrocortisone-Lidocaine topical formulation that is intended to provide anti-inflammation and anesthetic relief to persons suffering from hemorrhoids. We believe the markets for our products are large, growing, and underserved by the current prescription products. 

&#160;

References to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and similar words refer to the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Citius Pharmaceuticals LLC and LMB, taken as a whole. References to &#8220;Trail One&#8221; refer to the Company and its business prior to the Reverse Acquisition.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

We seek to achieve our business objectives by utilizing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s, or FDA&#8217;s, 505(b)(2) pathway for our new drug approvals. We believe this pathway is faster, has lower risk and is less expensive than the FDA&#8217;s traditional new drug approval pathway. In addition to focusing on new drug approvals, we focus on obtaining intellectual property protection with the objective of listing relevant patents in the FDA Orange Book in order to limit generic competition.

&#160;

By using previously approved drugs with substantial safety and efficacy data already available, we seek to reduce the risks associated with pharmaceutical product development. We have two development candidates. Our Mino-Lok product for the treatment of catheter related bloodstream infections has completed Phase 2b and is entering Phase 3 trials. We are also developing a topical product containing both hydrocortisone and lidocaine (Hydro-Lido) for the treatment of mild to moderate hemorrhoids. We are reformulating this product and will be entering Phase 2b trials in 2017.

&#160;

In July 2016, the Company decided to discontinue Suprenza, its FDA-approved phentermine-based product for weight loss, due to a strategic change in direction following the acquisition of LMB and the Mino-Lok product. In September 2016, Citius notified the FDA of its decision to voluntarily withdraw both the Investigative New Drug Application and New Drug Application for commercial reasons and not due to safety concerns, effective immediately. The Company had received no royalties from Suprenza and believed costs associated with the ongoing regulatory expenses were depleting resources from our more promising Mino-Lok and Hydro-Lido product candidates.

Mino-Lok TM 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Mino-Lok is a patented solution containing minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edetate), and ethyl alcohol, all of which act synergistically to treat and salvage infected central venous catheters (&#8220;CVCs&#8221;) in patients with catheter related bloodstream infections (&#8220;CRBIs&#8221;). Mino-Lok breaks down biofilm barriers formed by bacterial colonies, eradicate the bacteria, and provide anti-clotting properties to maintain patency in CVCs.

&#160;

The administration of Mino-Lok consists of filling the lumen of the catheter with 0.8 ml to 2.0 ml of Mino-Lok solution, with a lock (dwell-time) of two hours while the catheter is not in use. If the catheter has multiple lumens, all lumens may be locked with the Mino-Lok solution either simultaneously or sequentially. If patients are receiving continuous infusion therapy, the catheters alternate between being locked with the Mino-Lok solution and delivering therapy. The Mino-Lok therapy is two hours per day for at least five days, usually with additional locks in the subsequent two weeks. After locking the catheter for two hours, the Mino-Lok solution is aspirated, and the catheter is flushed with normal saline. At that time, either the infusion will be continued, or will be locked with the standard-of-care lock solution until further use of the catheter is required. In a clinical study conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center (&#8220;MDACC&#8221;), there were no serum levels of either minocycline or edetate detected in the sera of several patients who underwent daily catheter lock solution with minocycline and edetate (&#8220;M-EDTA&#8221;) at the concentration level proposed in Mino-Lok treatment. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the amount of either minocycline or edetate that leaks into the serum is very low or none at all.

&#160;

Phase 2b Results 

&#160;

From April 2013 to July 2014, 30 patients with CVC-related bloodstream infection were enrolled at MDACC in a prospective Phase 2b study. Patients received Mino-Lok therapy for two hours once daily for a minimum of five days within the first week followed by two additional locks within the next two weeks. Patients were followed for one month post lock therapy. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapy, as well as adverse events and outcome were collected for each patient. Median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range: 21-73 years). In all patients, prior to the use of lock therapy, systemic treatment with a cultured-directed, first-line intravenous was started. Microbiological eradication was achieved in all cases. None of the patients experienced any serious adverse event related to the lock therapy. 

&#160;

The active arm was then compared to 60 patients in a matched cohort that experienced removal and replacement of their CVCs within the same contemporaneous timeframe. The patients were matched for cancer type, infecting organism, and level of neutropenia. All patients were cancer patients and treated at the MDACC. The efficacy of Mino-Lok therapy was 100% in salvaging CVCs, demonstrating equal effectiveness to removing the infected CVC and replacing with a new catheter.

&#160;

However, the main purpose of the study was to show that Mino-Lok therapy was at least as safe as the removal and replacement of CVCs when CRBSIs are present, and that the complications of removing an infected catheter and replacing with a new one could be avoided. In addition to having a 100% efficacy rate with all CVCs being salvaged, Mino-Lok therapy had no significant adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;), compared to an 18% serious adverse event rate in the matched cohort where patients had the infected CVCs removed and replaced (&#8220;R&#38;R&#8221;). There were no overall complication rates in the Mino-Lok arm group compared to 11 events (18%) in the control group. These events included bacterial relapse (5%) and a number of complications associated with mechanical manipulation in the removal or replacement procedure for the catheter (10%) or development of deep seated infections such as septic thrombophlebitis and osteomyelitis (8%). It was noted that six (6) patients had more than one (1) complication in the control arm group.

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

Phase 3 Initiation 

&#160;

In November 2016, the Company initiated site recruitment for Phase 3 clinical trials. It is expected that patient enrollment will commence in the Company&#8217;s second quarter 2017.

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160;

In spite of best clinical practice, catheters contribute to approximately 70% of blood stream infections that occur in the ICU, or are associated with hemodialysis or cancer patients (approximately 470,000 per year). Bacteria enter the catheter either from the skin or intraluminally through the catheter hub. Once in the catheter, bacteria tend to form hard biofilm on the surface of the catheter that is resistant to most antimicrobial solutions. The most frequently used maintenance flush, heparin, actually stimulates biofilm formation. Heparin is widely used as a prophylactic lock solution, in spite of the evidence that it contributes to the promotion of biofilm formation. The formation of bacterial biofilm usually precedes CRBSIs.

&#160;

The standard of care (SOC) in the management of CRBSI patients consists of removing the infected CVC and replacing it with a new catheter at a different vascular access site. However, in cancer and hemodialysis patients with long-term surgically implantable silicone catheters, removal of the CVC and reinsertion of a new one at a different site might be difficult, or even impossible, because of the unavailability of other accessible vascular sites and the need to maintain infusion therapy. Furthermore, critically ill patients with short-term catheters often have underlying coagulopathy, which makes reinsertion of a new CVC at a different site, in the setting of CRBSIs, risky in terms of mechanical complications, such as pneumothorax, misplacement, or arterial puncture. Studies have also revealed that CRBSI patients may be associated with serious complications, including septic thrombosis, endocarditis and disseminated infection, particularly if caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Candida species. Furthermore, catheter retention in patients with CRBSIs is associated with a higher risk of relapse and poor response to antimicrobial therapy.

&#160;

According to Maki et al., published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2006, there are approximately 250,000 CRBSIs annually in the U.S. Subsequent to this study, our estimates have ranged upwards to over 450,000 central line-associated blood stream infections (&#8220;CLABSIs&#8221;) annually (see analysis in the table below). CRBSIs are associated with a 12% to 35% mortality rate and an attributable cost of $35,000 to $56,000 per episode. 

&#160;

We estimate that the potential market for Mino-Lok in the U.S. to be approximately $500 million to $1 billion as shown in the table below.

&#160;

Under various plausible pricing scenarios, we believe that Mino-Lok would be cost saving to the healthcare system given that the removal of an infected CVC and replacement of a new catheter in a different venous access site is estimated by the Company to cost between $8,000 and $10,000. Furthermore, there are potential additional medical benefits and reduction in patient discomfort with the Mino-Lok approach. We believe there will be an economic argument to enhance the adoption of Mino-Lok by infection control committees at acute care institutions.

Hydro-Lido 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Hydro-Lido is a topical formulation of hydrocortisone and lidocaine that is intended for the treatment of hemorrhoids. To our knowledge, there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Some physicians are known to prescribe topical steroids for the treatment of hemorrhoids. In addition, there are various strengths of topical combination prescription products containing hydrocortisone along with lidocaine or pramoxine, each a topical anesthetic, that are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of hemorrhoids. These products contain drugs that were in use prior to the start of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program and are commonly referred to as DESI drugs. However, none of these single-agent or combination prescription products have been clinically evaluated for safety and efficacy and approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Further, many hemorrhoid patients use over the counter (OTC) products as their first line therapy. OTC products contain any one of several active ingredients including glycerin, phenylephrine, pramoxine, white petrolatum, shark liver oil and/or witch hazel, for symptomatic relief. 

&#160;

Development of Hemorrhoids Drugs 

&#160;

Hemorrhoids are a common gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by anal itching, pain, swelling, tenderness, bleeding and difficulty defecating. In the U.S., hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million persons annually admitting to having symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease. Of these persons, approximately one third visit a physician for evaluation and treatment of their hemorrhoids. The data also indicate that for both sexes a peak of prevalence occurs from age 45 to 65 years with a subsequent decrease after age 65 years. Caucasian populations are affected significantly more frequently than African Americans, and increased prevalence rates are associated with higher socioeconomic status in men but not women. Development of hemorrhoids before age 20 is unusual. In addition, between 50% and 90% of the general U.S., Canadian and European population will experience hemorrhoidal disease at least once in life. Although hemorrhoids and other anorectal diseases are not life-threatening, individual patients can suffer from agonizing symptoms which can limit social activities and have a negative impact on the quality of life.

&#160;

Hemorrhoids are defined as internal or external according to their position relative to the dentate line. Classification is important for selecting the optimal treatment for an individual patient. Accordingly, physicians use the following grading system:

&#160;

Grade I

Hemorrhoids not prolapsed but bleeding.

&#160;

&#160;

Grade II 

Hemorrhoids prolapse and reduce spontaneously with or without bleeding.

&#160;

&#160;

Grade III 

Prolapsed hemorrhoids that require reduction manually.

&#160;

&#160;

Grade IV

Prolapsed and cannot be reduced including both internal and external hemorrhoids that are confluent from skin tag to inner anal canal.

&#160;

Development Activities to Date 

&#160;

In the fall of 2015, we completed dosing patients in a double-blind dose ranging placebo controlled Phase 2 study where six different formulations containing hydrocortisone and lidocaine in various strengths were tested against the vehicle control. The objectives of this study were to: 1) demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the formulations when applied twice daily for two weeks in subjects with Grade I or II hemorrhoids and 2) assess the potential contribution of lidocaine hydrochloride and hydrocortisone acetate, alone or in combination for the treatment of symptoms of Goligher&#8217;s Classification Grade I or II hemorrhoids.

&#160;

Symptom improvement was observed based on a global score of disease severity (&#8220;GSDS&#8221;), and based on some of the individual signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids, specifically itching and overall pain and discomfort. Within the first few days of treatment, the combination products (containing both hydrocortisone and lidocaine) were directionally favorable versus the placebo and their respective individual active treatment groups (e.g., hydrocortisone or lidocaine alone) in achieving &#8216;almost symptom free&#8217; or &#8216;symptom free&#8217; status according to the GSDS scale. These differences suggest the possibility of a benefit for the combination product formulation.

&#160;

Overall, results from adverse event reporting support the safety profile of all test articles evaluated in this study and demonstrate similar safety profiles as compared to the vehicle. The safety findings were unremarkable. There was a low occurrence of adverse events and a similar rate of treatment related adverse events across all treatment groups. The majority of adverse events were mild and only one was severe. None of the adverse events were serious and the majority of adverse events were recovered/resolved at the end of the study. There were only two subjects who were discontinued from the study due to adverse events. 

&#160; &#160; 7 

&#160;

In addition to the safety and dose-ranging information, information was obtained relating to the use of the GSDS as an assessment tool for measuring the effectiveness of the test articles. Individual signs and symptoms were also assessed but can vary from patient to patient. Therefore, the goal of the GSDS was to provide an assessment tool that could be used for all patients regardless of which signs and symptoms they are experiencing. The GSDS proved to be a more effective tool for assessing the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of the drug when compared to the assessment of the individual signs and symptoms. Citius believes that we can continue to develop this assessment tool as well as other patient reported outcome endpoints for use in the next trials. 

&#160;

Information was also obtained about the formulation of the drug and the vehicle. As a result of this study, we believe that the performance of the active arms of the study relative to the vehicle can be improved by re-formulating our topical preparation. Therefore, we have initiated work on vehicle formulation and evaluation of higher potency steroids. 

&#160;

We recently conducted primary market research to better understand the symptoms that are most bothersome to patients. We also learned about the factors that drive patients to seek medical attention for hemorrhoids in an effort to understand the disease impact on quality of life. The results of this survey are able to help us develop patient reported outcome evaluation tools. These tools can be used in clinical trials to evaluate the patients&#8217; conditions and to assess the performance of the test articles. 

&#160;

A Phase 2b study will begin once the new formulation is completed and the updated evaluation tools are developed. This study will be a 300 &#8211; 400 patient four arm study. The cost is estimated at approximately $3.0 &#8211; 5.0 million and is expected to require approximately one year to complete. 

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160;

The current market for OTC and topical DESI formulations of hydrocortisone and lidocaine is highly fragmented, and includes approximately 20 million units of OTC hemorrhoid products and over 4 million prescriptions for non-approved prescription treatments. Several topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids are available containing hydrocortisone in strengths ranging from 0.5% to 3.0%, combined with lidocaine in strengths ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. The various topical formulations include creams, ointments, gels, lotions, enemas, pads, and suppositories. The most commonly prescribed topical combination gel, is sold as a branded generic product and contains 2.5% hydrocortisone and 3.0% lidocaine. 

&#160;

We believe there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Although there are numerous prescription and OTC products commonly used to treat hemorrhoids, none possess proven safety and efficacy data generated from rigorously conducted clinical trials. We believe that a novel topical formulation of hydrocortisone and lidocaine designed to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief and which has an FDA-approved label specifically claiming the treatment of hemorrhoids will become an important treatment option for physicians who want to provide their patients with a therapy that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating this uncomfortable and often recurring disease. We believe that our Hydro-Lido product represents an attractive, low-risk product opportunity with meaningful upside potential.

&#160;

Market Exclusivity 

&#160;

We believe that we will be the first company to conduct rigorous clinical trials and receive FDA approval of a topical hydrocortisone-lidocaine combination product for the treatment of hemorrhoids. If we receive FDA approval, we will qualify for 3 years of market exclusivity for our dosage strength and formulation. In addition, we will also be the only product on the market specifically proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Generally, if a company conducts clinical trials and receives FDA approval of a product for which there are similar, but non FDA-approved, prescription products on the market, the manufacturers of the unapproved but marketed products are required to withdraw them from the market. However, the FDA has significant latitude in determining how to enforce its regulatory powers in these circumstances. We have not had any communication with the FDA regarding this matter and cannot predict what action, if any, the FDA will take with respect to the unapproved products.

&#160;

We believe that should our product receive an FDA approval and demonstrate, proven safety and efficacy data, and if our products obtain 3 years of market exclusivity based on our dosage strength and formulation, Citius is likely to have a meaningful advantage in its pursuit of achieving a significant position in the market for topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids.

&#160; &#160; 8 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We are primarily focused on identifying opportunities within the critical care and cancer care market segments. In our product acquisition criteria, we concentrate on markets that are highly influenced by key opinion leaders (KOLs) and have products that are prescribed by a relatively small number of physicians, yet provide large opportunities for growth and market share. This strategy allows for a manageable commercialization effort for our Company in terms of resources and capital. We also seek to provide cost-effective therapies that would be endorsed by payers, patients, and providers. We believe that we will be able to commercialize products within the scope of these criteria ourselves, and that we can create marketing synergies by having a common narrow audience for our marketing efforts (&#8220;several products in the bag for the same customer&#8221;).

&#160;

For products that we own that fall out of the narrow scope criteria, we have identified pharmaceutical companies with large sales forces, experienced sales and marketing management teams, direct-to-consumer (DTC) capabilities, significantly larger resources than ours, and non-competing product portfolios that we believe would make excellent sales and marketing partners for us. We intend to license our mass audience, non-specialty products to such companies for sales and marketing.

&#160;

&#160; Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We also search out regulatory protections, such as qualified infectious disease product, (&#8220;QIDP&#8221;), the Hatch Waxman Act of 1984, and others, to provide us with market exclusivity for a period of time. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates both in the U.S. and abroad. However, patent protection may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.

&#160;

Mino-Lok Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Mino-Lok is covered by an issued U.S. patent (no. 7,601,731), &#8220;Antimicrobials in Combination with Chelators and Ethanol for the Rapid Eradication of Microorganisms Embedded in Biofilm,&#8221; which was issued on October 13, 2009. This patent is a composition of matter patent and provides intellectual property protection until June 7, 2024. There are corresponding applications pending in Europe and Canada (European Application No. EP 1644024; Canadian Patent Application No. 0252852). On April 15, 2014, a patent application was filed for an enhanced formulation that provides greater stability of the reconstituted Mino-Lok solution. 

&#160;

On May 14, 2014, LMB entered into a patent and technology license agreement with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc., (&#8220;NAT&#8221;) to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive, worldwide (except for South America), sub licensable basis. LMB incurred a one-time license fee in May 2014. Under the license agreement, the Company will pay (i) an annual maintenance fee until commercial sales of a product subject to the license, (ii) upon commercialization, we will pay annual royalties on net sales of licensed products, (iii) and certain regulatory and milestone payments. Unless earlier terminated, the license agreement remains in effect until the date that all patents licensed under the agreement have expired and all patent applications within the licensed patent rights have been cancelled, withdrawn or expressly abandoned. 

&#160;

Mino-Lok has received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (&#8220;QIDP&#8221;) designation from the FDA. QIDP provides New Drug Applications an incremental 5 years of market exclusivity and, when combined with the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 as well as the pediatric exclusivity provision, Mino-Lok will have a combined total of 8 1/2 years of market exclusivity regardless of patent protection.

&#160;

Hydro-Lido Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We are developing a new formulation of Hydro-Lido which will have a unique combination of excipients as well as unique concentrations of the active ingredients. The goal is to have a product that is optimized for stability and activity. Once the formulation development is completed and data are obtained, we will apply for a patent on this new topical formulation.

&#160;

We seek to achieve approval for Hydro-Lido by utilizing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s, or FDA&#8217;s, 505(b)(2) pathway. This pathway will provide 3 years of market exclusivity. 

&#160; &#160; 9 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry which is subject to rapid and frequent changes. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the drug candidates that we are developing and the same or similar products that target the same conditions we intend to treat. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies.

&#160;

&#160; Mino-Lok TM 

&#160;

Currently, the only alternative to Mino-Lok in the treatment of infected CVCs in CRBSI/CLABSI patients of which we are aware, is the SOC of removing the culprit CVC and replacing a new CVC at a different vascular site. Citius is not aware of any Investigational New Drug Applications (&#8220;INDs&#8221;) for a salvage antibiotic lock solution and does not expect any to be forthcoming due to the difficulty of meeting the necessary criteria to be effective and practical. 

&#160;

At this time, there are no pharmacologic agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention or treatment of CLABSIs in central venous catheters. Citius is aware that there are several agents in development for prevention but none for salvage. The most prominent of these appear to be Neutrolin from CorMedix and B-Lock from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;GLP&#8221;).

&#160;

Neutrolin &#210; (CorMedix Inc.) 

&#160;

Neutrolin is a formulation of Taurolidine 1.35%, Citrate 3.5%, and Heparin 1000 units/mL. Neutrolin is an anti-microbial catheter lock solution being developed by CorMedix to prevent CRBSIs and to prevent clotting. In January 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations for Neutrolin. In December 2015, CorMedix initiated its Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis patients in the United States. The clinical trial named Catheter Lock Solution Investigational Trial, or LOCK-IT-100 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active control trial designed to show efficacy and safety of Neutrolin in preventing CRBSIs in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy. CorMedix has also announced that it plans to conduct a second Phase 3 trial in parenteral nutrition patients and is working closely with the FDA. This clinical trial is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 

&#160;

B-Lock&#8482; (Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) 

&#160;

B-Lock is a triple combination of trimethoprim, EDTA and ethanol from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;GLP&#8221;). On July 24, 2012, GLP announced the initiation of a clinical study of B-Lock. GLP has stated that it has developed B-Lock as a device/drug combination product capable of effective prevention of CRBSIs. The study that was announced is a prospective, randomized, active control clinical investigation to be conducted in 22 clinical sites in Hungary and Poland and involves up to 400 patients on renal dialysis who required a central venous catheter for vascular access. GLP has stated that the clinical data would be used for CE Mark approval in the European Union. We are unaware as to the progress or results of these studies. In addition, we are not aware of any IND being filed in the US for B-Lock, nor are we aware of any clinical studies to support salvage of infected catheters in bacteremic patients. 

&#160;

Neither of these lock solutions have been shown to be effective in salvaging catheters in bacteremic patients as Mino-Lok is intended to do, and Citius does not expect that either would be pursued for this indication.

&#160;

Hydro-Lido 

&#160;

The primary competition in the hemorrhoid market is non-prescription over the counter products. When approved, Hydro-Lido will be the only prescription product for the treatment of hemorrhoids.

Supply and Manufacturing 

&#160;

We do not currently have and we do not intend to set up our own manufacturing facilities. We expect to use approved contract manufacturers for manufacturing our products in all stages of development after we file for FDA approval. Each of our domestic and foreign contract manufacturing establishments, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the New Drug Application &#8220;NDA&#8221; and must be registered with the FDA. Also, the FDA imposes substantial annual fees on manufacturers of branded products. 

&#160;

In general, our suppliers purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; &#160; 10 

&#160;

If we elect to conduct product development and manufacturing, we will be subject to regulation under various federal and state laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations.

&#160;

We have contracted with proven suppliers and manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient, development and packaging. We are confident that all materials meet or will meet specifications discussed at the chemistry, manufacturing and controls meeting with the FDA. 

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

United States Government Regulation 

&#160;

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Citius&#8217; products may be classified by the FDA as a drug or a medical device depending upon the indications for use or claims. Because certain of our product candidates are considered as medical devices and others are considered as drugs for regulatory purposes, we intend to submit applications to regulatory agencies for approval or clearance of both medical devices and pharmaceutical product candidates.

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FFDCA&#8221;) and the agency&#8217;s implementing regulations. If Citius fails to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, and the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on Citius.

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

&#160;

As an alternate path to FDA approval for modifications to products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may file a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Act. This statutory provision permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely upon the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication for which the Section 505(b)(2) applicant has its own data.

&#160;

Applications filed pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) are assessed by the FDA on a case by case basis. Product approvals based on new clinical investigation are granted three years of Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity. Under this form of exclusivity, the FDA is precluded from approving a competing generic drug application or, in some cases, a competing 505(b)(2) application. However the FDA can accept and commence review of such applications during the three year exclusivity period and grant the approval concurrent with the expiration of the exclusivity period. Further, if another company obtains approval for either product candidate for the same indication we are studying before we do, our approval could be blocked until the other company&#8217;s Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity expires.

&#160;

&#160; Foreign Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

Citius and any collaborative partners may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, Citius or its collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in such countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country. 

&#160; &#160; 11 

&#160;

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every 5 years. The recertification process requires that Citius evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling Citius&#8217; products in those countries. 

&#160;

In the European Union, in order for a product to be marketed and sold, it is required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification. The CE Mark certification encompasses an extensive review of the applicant&#8217;s quality management system which is inspected by a notified body&#8217;s auditor as part of a stage 1 and 2 International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 13485:2016 audit, in accordance with worldwide recognized ISO standards and applicable European Medical Devices Directives for quality management systems for medical device manufacturers. Once the quality management system and design dossier has been successfully audited by a notified body and reviewed and approved by a competent authority, a CE certificate for the medical device will be issued. Applicants are also required to comply with other foreign regulations such as the requirement to obtain Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approval before a new product can be launched in Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market Citius&#8217; products may vary from U.S. approvals, and requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the FDA. 

&#160;

Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which Citius may do business outside the United States. These laws and regulations range from comprehensive device approval requirements for Citius&#8217; medical device product to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. Citius may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries and may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining its foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export of certain of Citius&#8217; products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Any failure to obtain product approvals in a timely fashion or to comply with state or foreign medical device laws and regulations may have a serious adverse effect on Citius&#8217; business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 6 employees and various consultants providing support. Through our consulting and collaboration arrangements, and including our Scientific Advisory Board, we have access to more than 30 additional professionals, who possess significant expertise in business development, legal, accounting, regulatory affairs, clinical operations and manufacturing. We also rely upon a network of consultants to support our clinical studies and manufacturing efforts.

Other Information 

&#160;

While the Company was not previously subject to the filing requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), it filed certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on a voluntarily basis. On October 22, 2015, the Company registered its Common Stock under the Exchange Act and the filing of the reports with the SEC became mandatory.
