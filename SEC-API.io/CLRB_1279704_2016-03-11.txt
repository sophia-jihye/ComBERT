Business Overview 

&#160;

Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. (the Company) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of targeted phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) for the treatment and imaging of cancer. The Company&#8217;s research and development program is based on its proprietary PDC cancer targeting delivery platform. The delivery platform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of a broad range of cancer targeting agents. The company&#8217;s pipeline is comprised of pre-clinical and clinical product candidates including radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic PDC&#8217;s. The pipeline also includes diagnostic and optical imaging assets. The company&#8217;s research and development resources are focused on the clinical advancement of its therapeutic PDC&#8217;s.

&#160;

Our core company strategy is to leverage our industry leading PDC, proprietary cancer targeting delivery platform to generate capital, supplement internal resources and accelerate and broaden product candidate clinical development through strategic asset and research collaborations.

&#160;

Our shares are listed on the NASDAQ&#174; Capital Market under the symbol CLRB; prior to August 15, 2014, our shares were quoted on the OTCQX&#174; marketplace, and prior to February 12, 2014 were quoted under the symbol NVLT.

&#160;

Our PDC platform is based on our cancer-targeting and delivery technology which provides selective delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. By linking various drug payloads to our proprietary phospholipid ether cancer-targeting vehicle, we believe we can create PDCs with the potential to provide highly targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic payloads to a broad range of cancers. As a result, our PDC platform has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of drug payloads, enhancing or maintaining efficacy while reducing adverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, increasing delivery to cancer cells and a broad range of cancerous tumors. The PDC product portfolio includes:

&#160;

&#183; CLR 131 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting radiotherapeutic PDC that is designed to deliver cytotoxic (cell-killing) radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. CLR 131 is our lead PDC radiotherapeutic product candidate and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study for the treatment of relapse or refractory multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of plasma cells. This cancer type was selected for both clinical and commercial rationales, including multiple myeloma&#8217;s highly radiosensitive nature, continued unmet medical need in the relapse/refractory setting and the receipt of an orphan drug designation. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The Phase 1 study was initiated in April 2015 and we announced performance results from the first patient cohort in January of 2016. The study&#8217;s Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), unanimously agreed to advance CLR 131 into the second cohort. Patient enrollment is currently ongoing and the company plans to provide a study update in the third quarter of 2016. The primary goals of the Phase 1 study are to assess the compound&#8217;s safety, identify the optimal Phase 2 dose, and possibly obtain an early evaluation of low dose drug activity. &#160;

&#183; The Company is exploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized chemotherapeutic payloads under its CLR CTX Chemotherapeutic PDC program. The objective of our CTX program is to develop PDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand potential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads. Initial CTX product candidates include CLR 1601-PTX, CLR 1602-PTX and CLR 1603-PTX; all are small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. These PDCs are designed to selectively deliver paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic payload to cancer cells and cancer stem cells to increase the therapeutic index of paclitaxel as a monotherapy. Each of our paclitaxel PDC&#8217;s have been evaluated in vitro to demonstrate formulation stability and CLR 1602-PTX is currently being studied in vivo to further explore the PDC&#8217;s cancer targeting selectivity. In December of 2015, the company entered into a research collaboration for our PDC technology with Pierre Fabre laboratories, the third largest French pharmaceutical company. The objective of the research collaboration is to co-design a library of PDC&#8217;s employing Pierre Fabre&#8217;s natural product derived chemotherapeutics in combination with our proprietary cancer targeting delivery vehicle. The newly developed PDC&#8217;s may provide enhanced therapeutic indices to otherwise highly potent, non-targeted payloads through the targeted delivery to cancer cells provided by our cancer targeted delivery vehicle. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; CLR 125 is a broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting radiotherapeutic currently under pre-clinical investigation for the treatment of micrometastatic disease. In October, 2015, the company was awarded a national Cancer Institute Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to further advance its PDC delivery platform through CLR 125 preclinical and clinical research. The collaboration is designed to further explore the targeted delivery of radioisotopes for improved cancer therapy outcomes. The grant is awarded in two installments with up to $2.3 million in funding. Similar to CLR 131, the selective uptake and retention of CLR 125 has been observed in malignant tissues during pre-clinical studies. CLR 125 uses the radioisotope Iodine-125 (which has a 60-day half-life), which may provide an excellent tumor kinetics match with Cellectar&#8217;s proprietary delivery vehicle. Ongoing pre-clinical research includes: chemistry, manufacturing and controls of CLR 125; biodistribution and toxicity studies of CLR 125 in pre-clinical models; and efficacy and dose-response studies. &#160;

&#183; CLR 124 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) imaging PDC that we believe has the potential to be the first of its kind for the selective detection of tumors and metastases in a broad range of cancers. CLR 124 has been used for PET/CT imaging in a broad array of tumor types through Company and investigator-sponsored clinical trials. We are in the process of evaluating the data from those studies. In April 2014, the FDA granted CLR 124 orphan status as a diagnostic for the management of glioma. &#160;

&#183; CLR 1502 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting NIR-fluorophore optical imaging PDC for intraoperative tumor and tumor margin illumination. This past June, after review of the Company's IND application, the FDA determined that CLR 1502 will be evaluated as a combination product and assigned to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). As a result of this classification, the FDA has advised Cellectar that it will need to submit a new investigational application for the combination product prior to initiating its Phase 1 study in breast cancer surgery. As a result, Cellectar is working to identify the optimal clinical development and value optimizing strategic pathway. Based on our assessment, the Company believes that product will be similarly treated post marketing approval regardless of the regulatory pathway. &#160;

We believe our PDC platform has potential to provide targeted delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads, as exemplified by the product candidates listed above, that may result in improvements upon current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment and imaging of a broad range of human cancers.

&#160; 

Technology Overview 

&#160;

Our product candidates are based on a cancer-targeting delivery platform of optimized PLE analogs (phospholipid ether proprietary delivery vehicle) that interact with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of a cell&#8217;s membrane phospholipid bilayer that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids and serve to organize cell surface and intracellular signaling molecules. As a result of enrichment of lipid rafts in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, our products provide selective targeting preferentially over normal healthy cells. The cancer-targeting PLE delivery vehicle was deliberately designed to be combined with therapeutic, diagnostic and imaging molecules. For example, iodine can be attached via a very stable covalent bond resulting in distinct products differing only with respect to the isotope of iodine they contain; CLR 131 contains radioactive I-131, CLR 125 contains radioactive I-125, and CLR 124 contains the shorter-lived radioactive I-124. In addition, non-radioactive molecules, including cytotoxic compounds can also be attached to the delivery vehicle.

&#160;

The Company is focused on exploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized chemotherapeutic payloads under its CLR CTX Chemotherapeutic PDC program. The objective of our CTX program is to develop PDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand potential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads. Initial CTX product candidates include CLR 1601-PTX, CLR 1602-PTX and CLR 1603-PTX; all are small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. To date, multiple cancer-targeting product profiles have been generated from a single chemical core structure that is the foundation of our technology platform. We also believe that additional cytotoxic PDCs may be developed possessing enhanced therapeutic indices versus the original, non-targeted cytotoxic payload as a monotherapy.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the case of CLR 1502, this is a near-infrared (800 nm) emitting fluorophore whose signal can penetrate through up to approximately 1 cm of tissue. This may enable the use of CLR 1502 to visualize tumor margins during cancer surgery, effectively acting as an adjunct to a therapeutic agent, and to non-invasively detect relatively superficial tumors

&#160;

Malignant tumor targeting, including targeting of cancer stem cells, has been demonstrated in vivo . Mice without intact immune systems, and inoculated with Panc-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) cells, were injected with CLR 1502, 24 or 96 hours prior to imaging. In vivo optical imaging showed pronounced accumulation of CLR 1502 in tumors versus non-target organs and tissues. Similarly, PET imaging of tumor-bearing animals (colon, glioma, triple negative breast and pancreatic tumor xenograft models) administered the imaging agent CLR 124 clearly shows selective uptake and retention by both primary tumors and metastases, including cancer stem cells. PET/CT analysis following co-injection of CLR 131 (for therapy) and CLR 124 (for imaging) revealed time-dependent tumor responses and disappearance over nine days in a cancer xenograft model. We believe that the capability of our technology to target and be selectively retained by cancer stem cells in vivo, was demonstrated by treating glioma stem cell-derived orthotopic tumor-bearing mice with another fluorescent-labeled PDC (CLR 1501), and then removing the tumor and isolating cancer stem cells, which continued to display CLR 1501 labeling even after three weeks in cell culture.

&#160;

The basis for selective tumor targeting of our compounds lies in differences between the plasma membranes of cancer cells as compared to those of most normal cells. Data suggests that lipid rafts serve as portals of entry for PDCs such as CLR 131, CLR 124 and CLR 1502. The marked selectivity of our compounds for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells is due to the fact that cancer cells are over-expressed with lipid rafts as compared to normal cells. Following cell entry via lipid rafts, CLR 131, CLR 124 and CLR 1502 are transported into the cytoplasm, where they distribute to organelle membranes (mitochondria, ER, lysosomes) but not the nucleus. The pivotal role played by lipid rafts is underscored by the fact that disruption of lipid raft architecture significantly suppresses uptake of our PDC delivery vehicle into cancer cells.

&#160;

Our core technology platform is based on research conducted by Cellectar, Inc.&#8217;s founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Jamey Weichert, beginning in 1994 at the University of Michigan (U. Mich.), where phospholipid ether analogs were initially designed, synthesized, radiolabeled, and evaluated in the laboratory of Dr. Raymond Counsell. Since 1998, Dr. Weichert has continued his research at the University of Wisconsin (U. Wisc.) and subsequently founded Cellectar, Inc. in 2002 to further develop and commercialize the technology. Cellectar, Inc. obtained exclusive rights to the related technology patents owned by U. Mich. in 2003 and continued development of the PDC platform while obtaining ownership of numerous additional patents and patent applications (lasting until 2025, 2028, 2030 and 2034 without extensions).

&#160; 

Products in Development 

&#160; 

CLR 131 

&#160;

CLR 131 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting molecular radiotherapeutic PDC that we believe has the potential to be the first radiotherapeutic agent to use PLEs to target cancer cells. CLR 131 is comprised of our proprietary PLE, 18-(p-[I-131]iodophenyl) octadacyl phosphocholine, acting as a cancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently labeled with iodine-131, a cytotoxic (cell-killing) radioisotope with a half-life of eight days that is already in common use to treat thyroid and other cancer types. It is this &#8220;intracellular radiation&#8221; mechanism of cancer cell killing, coupled with delivery to a wide range of malignant tumor types that we believe provides CLR 131 with broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity. Selective uptake and retention has been demonstrated in cancer stem cells compared with normal cells, offering the prospect of longer lasting cancer activity.

&#160;

Pre-clinical experiments in tumor models have demonstrated selective killing of cancer cells along with a benign safety profile. CLR 131&#8217;s anti-tumor/survival-prolonging activities have been demonstrated in more than a dozen models including breast, prostate, lung, brain, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, renal, and colorectal cancers as well as, melanoma and multiple myeloma. In all but two models, a single administration of a well-tolerated dose of CLR 131 was sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. Moreover, efficacy was also seen in a model employing human uterine sarcoma cells that have known resistance to many standard chemotherapeutic drugs. CLR 131 was also tested in combination with a standard efficacious dose of gemcitabine in a pancreatic cancer model. Single doses of CLR 131 or gemcitabine given alone were equally efficacious while the combination therapy was significantly more efficacious than either treatment alone (additive). In each study, the dose of CLR 131 was ~100 &#181;Ci, which is approximately 50-fold less than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CLR 131 determined in a six-month rat radiotoxicity study.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Extensive IND-enabling, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) in vivo and in vitro pre-clinical pharmacokinetic/ distribution, toxicology and drug safety studies were successfully completed in 2007 through 2009 using non-pharmacological concentrations/doses of PLE consistent with its role as a delivery/retention vehicle in CLR 131. Tissue distribution studies supported prediction of acceptable human organ exposures and body clearance for CLR 131. Importantly, and in sharp distinction from biological products labeled with I-131, the small-molecule CLR 131 showed very minimal variation in excretion kinetics and tissue distribution among individuals within species or across a 500-fold variation in dose. Single- and repeated-dose animal toxicology studies indicated very high margins of safety with our PLE delivery and retention vehicle even when administered at 80-200x over the amount required to deliver the anticipated maximum human therapy dose of CLR 131.

&#160;

In 2009, we filed an IND with the FDA to study CLR 131 in humans. In February 2010, we completed a Phase 1 dosimetry trial with a single intravenous dose of 10 mCi/m 2 CLR 131 in eight patients with relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors. Single doses of CLR 131 were well tolerated. The reported adverse events were all considered minimal, manageable and either not dose limiting or not related to CLR 131. There were no serious adverse events reported. Analysis of total body imaging and blood and urine samples collected over 42 days following injection indicated that doses of CLR 131 expected to be therapeutically effective could be administered without harming vital organs. Two subjects (one with colorectal cancer metastasized to lung and another with prostate cancer) had tumors that were imaged with 3D nuclear scanning (SPECT/CT) on day 6 after administration of CLR 131. Uptake of CLR 131 into tumor tissue (but not adjacent normal tissue or bone marrow) was clearly demonstrated in both subjects. Echoing animal studies, pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated a prolonged half-life of radioactivity in the plasma after CLR 131 administration (approximately 200 hours) and that there was no significant variation in excretion or radiation dosimetry among subjects. The trial established an initial dose of 12.5 mCi/m 2 , for the Phase 1b escalating dose trial that commenced in January 2012.

&#160;

The primary objective of the multicenter Phase 1b dose-escalation trial in patients with a range of advanced solid tumors was to define the MTD of CLR 131. In addition to determining the MTD, the Phase 1b trial was intended to evaluate overall tumor response (using standard RESIST 1.1 criteria) and safety. In September 2012, we announced that we had successfully completed the second cohort in this Phase 1b dose-escalation trial. The second two-patient cohort was successfully dosed with 25 mCi/m 2 of CLR 131, triggering enrollment into the third cohort at 37.5 mCi/m 2 . Data from the second cohort indicated CLR 131 was well-tolerated, without any dose limiting or sub-dose limiting toxicities, enabling enrollment of the third cohort. Data from the two-patient, third cohort indicated the onset of dose-limiting hematologic toxicities with CLR 131, triggering enrollment into a five-patient, fourth cohort at a dose midway between those used in the second and third cohorts, as per trial protocol. Four patients were enrolled in the fourth cohort and we ended enrollment in November 2013. Complete study results, including data from the fourth cohort of this trial were completed in the first quarter 2014. The results of the trial were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, 2014.

&#160;

Tumor treatment with radioactive isotopes has been used as a fundamental cancer therapeutic for decades. The goals of targeted cancer therapy &#8212; selective delivery of effective doses of isotopes that destroy tumor tissue, sparing of surrounding normal tissue, and non-accumulation in vital organs such as the liver and kidneys &#8212; remains the focus of new therapies as well. We believe our isotope delivery technology is poised to achieve these goals. Because, to date, CLR 131 has been shown to reliably and near-universally accumulate in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, and because the therapeutic properties of iodine-131 are well known, we believe the risk of non-efficacy in human clinical trials is less than that of other cancer therapies at this stage of development, although no assurance can be given.

&#160;

In view of CLR 131&#8217;s selective uptake and retention in a wide range of solid tumors and in cancer stem cells, its single-agent efficacy in animal models and its non-specific mechanism of cancer-killing (radiation), we are initially developing CLR 131 as a monotherapy for cancer indications with significant unmet medical need. While a number of indications were evaluated as the initial target treatment, multiple myeloma was selected principally because it is an incurable hematologic disease that is highly radiosensitive with significant unmet medical need in the relapse or refractory clinical setting, and is designated as an orphan disease. All of which may provide an accelerated regulatory pathway due to CLR 131 unique benefits versus existing therapeutic treatment options such as a novel mechanism of action and single dose treatment. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application was accepted by the FDA in September 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We initiated our Phase 1 Study of CLR 131 for the treatment of Relapsed or Refractory multiple myeloma in April 2015, and provided a performance update on the first patient cohort and initiated the second study cohort in January 2016. CLR 131 is anticipated to be used as monotherapy through phase 1 clinical trials, with subsequent exploration of CLR 131 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (a number of which are known to be radiosensitizers and thus have the potential to enhance the efficacy of CLR 131) and in combination with external beam radiotherapy.

CTX Product Portfolio 

&#160;

The Company is exploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized chemotherapeutic payloads under its CLR CTX Chemotherapeutic PDC program. The objective of our CTX program is to develop PDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand potential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads. Initial CTX product candidates include CLR 1601-PTX, CLR 1602-PTX and CLR 1603-PTX; both all are small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. These PDCs are designed to selectively deliver paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic payload to cancer cells and cancer stem cells increasing the therapeutic index of paclitaxel as a monotherapy. Each of our paclitaxel PDC&#8217;s are being have been evaluated in vitro to demonstrate formulation stability and CLR 1602-PTX is currently being studied in vivo to demonstrate formulation stability and further explore the PDC&#8217;s cancer targeting selectivity. In December of 2015, the company entered into a research collaboration for our PDC technology with Pierre Fabre laboratories, the third largest French pharmaceutical company. The objective of the research collaboration is to co-design a library of PDC&#8217;s employing Pierre Fabre&#8217;s natural product derived chemotherapeutics in combination with our proprietary cancer targeting delivery vehicle. The newly developed PDC&#8217;s may provide enhanced therapeutic indices to otherwise highly potent, non-targeted payloads through the targeted delivery to cancer cells provided by our cancer targeted delivery vehicle.

&#160; 

CLR 125 

&#160;

CLR 125 research is fully funded through an NCI Small Business Research Grant (&#8220;SBIR&#8221;). CLR 125 is a broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting, radiotherapeutic currently under pre-clinical investigation for the treatment of micrometastatic disease. Similar to CLR 131, the selective uptake and retention of CLR 125 has been observed in malignant tissues during pre-clinical studies. CLR 125 uses the radioisotope iodine-125 (which has a 60-day half-life), which may provide an excellent tumor kinetics match with Cellectar&#8217;s proprietary delivery vehicle. Ultimately, this would yield a superior therapeutic ratio for CLR 125. The feasibility and safety of CLR 125 is currently being investigated for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the (neo) adjuvant setting. This program was initiated on October1, 2015. This Phase 1 is part of a larger Phase 1/2 SBIR Fast-Track grant that was awarded Cellectar in September 2015. Upon successful completion of the preclinical work in Phase 1, an additional grant in the amount of $2.0 million may be awarded by the NCI for the Phase 2 option period. Based upon pre-clinical performance and a thorough analysis of the clinical and commercial potential of CLR 125, Cellectar will determine whether to advance or cease additional research. Deliverables of the pre-clinical research conducted during Phase 1 will include: chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) of CLR 125; biodistribution and toxicity studies of CLR 125 in pre-clinical models of TNBC; and efficacy and dose-response studies. The anticipated completion date for the Phase 1 efforts is June 30, 2016.

&#160; 

Additional Assets 

&#160; 

CLR 124 

&#160;

CLR 124 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting imaging agent that we believe has first-in-class potential for selective detection of primary tumors and metastases in a broad range of cancers. Chemically, CLR 124 is comprised of our proprietary PLE, 18-(p-[I-124] iodophenyl) octadacyl phosphocholine, acting as a cancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently labeled with iodine-124, a PET imaging radioisotope with a radiation half-life of four days. PET imaging used in conjunction with CT scanning has now become the imaging method of choice in much of oncology. In pre-clinical studies to date, CLR 124 selectively illuminated malignant tumors in over 60 animal models of different cancer types, demonstrating broad-spectrum, cancer-selective uptake and retention. Investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trials of CLR 124 as a PET imaging agent are ongoing across multiple solid tumor indications. These trials have demonstrated positive initial imaging results in multiple tumor types. Based on positive initial CLR 124 imaging results in 29 primary and metastatic brain cancer patients, we believe CLR 124 has potential to address a significant unmet medical need for post-treatment efficacy assessment and differentiating tumor growth from pseudo-progression. In brain cancer, this has the potential to avoid unnecessary surgeries, biopsies and inappropriate treatment, resulting in better patient management and lower healthcare costs. We expect glioblastoma to be our lead indication for CLR 124 with additional development opportunities that could include brain metastases and other primary brain tumors.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

These human trials are intended to provide proof-of-concept for CLR 124 as a PET imaging agent with the potential to supplant current imaging standards of care, FDG for various solid tumors, or MRI in the case of brain cancers. This is due to what we believe to be CLR 124&#8217;s superior cancer selectivity. Furthermore, the radiation half-life of only 110 minutes for fluorine-18 labeled agents, such as FDG, severely limits their use to locations close to the point of manufacture. CLR 124&#8217;s much longer radiation half-life affords a longer imaging window of up to seven days following injection, resulting in more favorable logistics of clinical use, including the ability to be distributed to clinics throughout the U.S. from a single manufacturing site. As a chemically identical biomarker for CLR 131, CLR 124 imaging may also be capable of estimating an efficacious dose of CLR 131 in individual cancer patients.

&#160;

A three-part investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of radiolabeled CLR 1404 for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was initiated in February 2004 at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC). The first part of the trial evaluated imaging characteristics of CLR 131 in seven patients and the second part of the trial evaluated tumor accumulation in one patient. The third part of the trial is now evaluating tumor imaging with CLR 124 at increasing doses. Dr. Anne M. Traynor at UWCCC is the principal investigator for this trial. We provided funding and the data was shared with us while the study progressed and at the conclusion of the study. A total of 11 patients were enrolled across four dose levels (1.5 mCi/m 2 , 3 mCi/m 2 , 5 mCi/m 2 and 7.5 mCi/m 2 ) in this part of the Phase 1/2 trial. With the 5 mCi/m 2 dose level, we saw clear and sustained uptake of CLR 124 in cancerous tumors against low background and have not observed any adverse safety signals. In addition, in one patient, three brain metastases were detected with CLR 124 that were not identified with FDG PET, which following confirmation with current standard of care (SOC), prompted an alteration to the treatment plan for this patient. Having observed initial cancer-specific uptake with CLR 124 at a 7.5 mCi/m 2 dose in NSCLC patients, study investigators continued exploration of dose and imaging time points in an effort to optimize dosing and results.

&#160;

An investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of CLR 124 as a PET imaging agent for brain cancer was initiated in December 2011 at UWCCC and the first patient was enrolled in March 2012. This trial was funded by both the UWCCC and an Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) grant, and the data is shared with the Company. Enrollment to the trial is complete; 12 patients were dosed with 5 mCi/m 2 of CLR 124. The preliminary results showed avid and sustained uptake of CLR 124 in cancerous tumors against very low background and no adverse safety signals were observed.

&#160;

An investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of CLR 124 as a PET imaging agent for glioma was initiated in January 2012 at UWCCC and the clinical trial protocol evaluates 7.5 mCi/m 2 and 10 mCi/m 2 doses of CLR 124. A total of 19 patients were enrolled.

&#160;

An investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of CLR 124 as a PET imaging agent for patients with multiple solid tumor types (triple negative breast, prostate, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, esophageal, soft tissue sarcoma, and head &#38; neck cancer) was initiated in August 2012 at the UWCCC and the first patient was enrolled in October 2012. We provided funding for the trial and the data was shared with us. Twelve patients were enrolled, completing the enrollment of the trial.

&#160; 

CLR 1502 

&#160;

CLR 1502 is a small-molecule, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting, non-radioactive optical imaging agent that we believe has the potential to be the first of its kind for intraoperative tumor margin illumination and non-invasive tumor imaging. CLR 1502 is comprised of a proprietary PLE, acting as a cancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently attached to a near-infrared (800nm) fluorophore. According to the American Cancer Society, the majority of cancer patients were expected to have some type of surgery and more than 1.6 million new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. alone in 2014. CLR 1502 may facilitate and enable diagnostic, staging, debulking and curative cancer surgeries, intraoperatively in real-time, by defining tumor margins and regional lymph node involvement, resulting in more complete tumor resections and improving outcome and prognosis. In this context, CLR 1502 could effectively act as an adjunct therapeutic agent. In pre-clinical tumor models, non-invasive optical imaging showed pronounced accumulation of CLR 1502 in tumors versus normal tissues and successfully delineated tumor margins during tumor resection. CLR 1502 may also have utility for non-invasive imaging of relatively superficial tumor types in man (e.g., melanoma, head &#38; neck, colon, esophageal).

Market Overview 

&#160;

Our target market is broad and represents the market for the treatment and imaging of cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 1.67 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2015 and approximately 590,000 are expected to die of cancer. The global market for cancer drugs has reached $100 billion in annual sales (May 2015), and could reach $147 billion by 2018, according to a new report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a unit of drug data provider IMS Health. This growth will be driven by emerging targeted therapies, which are expected to change the cancer treatment landscape (Cowen), and an increased use of cancer drug combination regimens. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimated that the direct medical cost for treating cancer in 2010 (the latest figure available) was $124.6 billion in the U.S., and projects that by 2020, this cost will have risen to at least $158 billion.

According to the National Cancer Institute SEER data base, multiple myeloma is the 2 nd most common hematologic cancer with a U.S. incidence rate of 24,050 and a relapse or refractory patient population of 10,000 to 15,000. A Market Research Engine report from December 2015 indicated the global cancer diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% during 2015 to 2022.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We maintain a Good Manufacturing Practices compliant (cGMP) radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin, in which we manufacture drug substance for CLR 131, CLR 124, and CLR 1502 product candidates and also manufacture CLR 131 for clinical trials. This facility, consisting of approximately 19,500 square feet, contains offices, laboratories, a radiopharmaceutical research lab, a cGMP radiopharmaceutical manufacturing suite and a cGMP analytical laboratory for product release. Our manufacturing facility holds a State of Wisconsin Department of Health Services Radioactive Materials License which authorizes the use and possession of radioactive material for both manufacturing and distribution activities. The facility also holds a State of Wisconsin DHS Radioactive Materials License that authorizes the use and possession of radioactive materials for research and development. The research and development license permits the use and possession of iodine-125, iodine-131 and iodine-124 in quantities sufficient to support in-house drug substance and CLR 131manufacturing for current clinical programs and other research needs. Each of these iodine isotopes is purchased from third party vendors.

&#160;

Manufacturing of cGMP CLR 124 is currently conducted by our collaborator, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, using drug substance produced in our Madison manufacturing facility. The agreement contains standard provisions for the protection of data and intellectual property and may be terminated by either party with 60-days&#8217; notice, pending the completion of any obligations by either party set forth in an outstanding statement of work. The proprietary contract manufacturing process is sufficient to provide materials for Phase 2 trials and is scalable for larger trials. We do not plan to build in-house manufacturing capability for CLR 124.

&#160;

The drug substance is identical for CLR 131 and CLR 124 products. The base molecule is a dry powder produced via a six-step synthetic scheme. The release specifications for drug substance have been established and validated. The impurity levels at small scale are very low, suggesting that larger scale production is feasible. We have also demonstrated 60-month stability for the drug substance in desiccated and refrigerated forms. We believe our laboratories are well equipped with the appropriate equipment for manufacturing pilot and small-scale batches in accordance with cGMP. We believe we have adequate drug substance manufacturing and CLR 131 drug product manufacturing capacity expertise and capacity for non-pivotal clinical trials.

&#160;

CLR 1502 drug substance is synthesized at the Madison facility via a cGMP process from the same chemical precursor used in the manufacture of CLR 131. The facility has the capability to manufacture the CLR 1502 drug product to support Phase 1 clinical trials. Manufacturing of drug substance and drug product for subsequent clinical trials will likely be achieved through contract manufacturing.

&#160;

All investigational drug substance and product intended for human use during clinical studies will be manufactured according to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, FDA requirements (CFR part 211) and cGMP.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have not entered into any joint development, licensing or similar partnering agreements with respect to any of our clinical stage product candidates or pre-clinical compounds. We plan to pursue and evaluate all available options to develop, launch and commercialize our compounds. These options presently include, but are not limited to: entering into a partnering arrangement with one or more pharmaceutical, imaging agent or imaging device companies with strong development and commercial expertise and infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and/or Japan. While we currently do not plan to build our own sales force or utilize a contract sales organization for launch and commercialization of our compounds, we may reconsider that in the future.

&#160; 

Competition for Our Clinical-Stage Compounds 

&#160; 

CLR 131 

&#160;

Currently, several classes of approved products with various mechanisms of action exist, including: immune-modulating agents, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, and traditional chemotherapeutics. While a number of indications were evaluated as the initial target treatment for CLR 131, multiple myeloma was selected principally because of its highly radiosensitive nature, single dose treatment, and novel mechanism of action relative to all existing classes of approved drugs. As a result, we believe CLR 131 is an ideal therapeutic option in the relapse or refractory setting either as a monotherapy or in combination with currently approved agents, some of which are radiosensitive and maintain exclusive adverse event profiles.

&#160; 

CLR 124 

&#160;

FDG is the current SOC for cancer PET imaging. FDG accumulates in any tissue having increased glucose metabolism (i.e. energy utilization) compared to surrounding tissue. As a result, and in contrast to CLR 124, FDG is not selective for malignant tumors. FDG localizes in certain normal tissue such as heart, liver and brain tissues that also have high glucose metabolism as well as kidney and bladder due to FDG excretion paths. FDG is also known to localize in inflammatory sites, which are often found in the vicinity of malignancies and can result in diagnostic and treatment plan uncertainties. Other major limitations to the use of FDG are found in pelvic imaging due to the high renal (kidney) clearance of the compound. Moreover, there are clinically important malignancies that do not demonstrate reliable FDG activity such as prostate cancer. We believe these characteristics of FDG decrease its diagnostic specificity for certain malignancies. FDG is no longer covered by patent and is typically manufactured at or extremely proximate to PET imaging medical facilities because of its very short (110 minute) radiation half-life. I-124 has a four-day half-life that permits worldwide distribution of CLR 124 from one manufacturing location. Additionally, the longer half-life affords a longer imaging window of up to seven days following injection. 

&#160;

MRI is the current SOC for imaging brain cancer, due in part to FDG PET&#8217;s limited utility in brain imaging. While MRI can differentiate tissue densities and demark structural changes in tissue, it is not cancer-selective. This imaging can result in a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians, particularly with respect to glioma; the most common form of primary brain cancer. After chemo-radiation - commonly employed in glioma management - MRI changes suggestive of tumor recurrence are seen in approximately 50% of high-grade glioma patients. However, in approximately 50% of these cases, the MRI changes actually represent treatment-related changes that do not truly represent disease progression. This is termed pseudo-progression. The dilemma facing clinicians is the decision whether to re-treat the patient (surgery, chemotherapy, biological therapy, re-irradiation) with associated risks to the patient (e.g. damage to normal brain tissue and consequent loss of function), or monitor with periodic re-imaging with the risk of the imaging changes actually representing tumor recurrence, and with the costs associated with re-imaging.

&#160;

In Phase 1/2 investigator-sponsored trials at the UWCCC, preliminary results suggest that CLR 124 may provide a more accurate assessment of the post-treatment progression of glioma when compared to MRI. Specifically, CLR 124 appears to be capable of distinguishing malignant tumors from tissue changes associated with pseudo-progression.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

CLR 1502 

&#160;

CLR 1502 is a pre-clinical, broad-spectrum, cancer-targeting, non-radioactive optical imaging agent for intraoperative tumor margin illumination and non-invasive tumor imaging. The topic of providing cancer surgeons with better technology for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins designed to result in more complete tumor removal has gained considerable attention in recent years. While there are a number of technologies in various stages of development, some of the most common categories include the use of fluorescence agents: either alone, or attached to cancer delivery vehicles, nanoparticle technologies or electromagnetic technologies. At present, the only known FDA approved technology for tumor margin assessment is believed to be MarginProbe TM , marketed by Dune Medical Devices, which received FDA approval in January, 2013, as an intraoperative tissue assessment tool for early-stage breast cancer surgery. MarginProbe TM claims to use electromagnetic &#8220;signatures&#8221; to identify healthy and cancerous tissue.

&#160;

5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a technology approved in Europe for use with intraoperative tumor margin assessment, is a small molecule that is preferentially taken up by tumor cells leading to biosynthesis and accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, a natural fluorophore with red fluorescence emission. Investigator sponsored trials of 5-ALA are ongoing in the U.S., primarily in newly diagnosed and recurrent brain cancer indications.

&#160;

Other technologies known to be in development include Blaze Biosciences&#8217; Tumor Paint TM , a combination of a targeting peptide and a fluorescent beacon, under development for cancer surgery in multiple solid tumor types. Additionally, Avelas Biosciences, based in San Diego, CA, is developing a fluorescence peptide based compound named AVB-620 for fluorescence image-guided cancer surgery.

&#160;

While a number of technologies are in development to provide intraoperative tumor margin guidance we are leveraging our cancer-targeting delivery platform to provide cancer selectivity and specificity for accurate tumor margin illumination. Further, CLR 1502 may be able to demonstrate application with a broad spectrum of cancer types based on data that includes our other product candidates utilizing the same cancer-targeting delivery platform in pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials (CLR 124 and CLR 131).

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have established a broad U.S. and international intellectual property rights portfolio around our proprietary cancer-targeting PLE technology platform including our CLR CTX Program, CLR 131, CLR 1502, CLR 124, and CLR 125.

&#160;

CLR CTX Program: In November 2015, we converted our previously filed provisional patent application for Phospholipid-Ether Analogs as Cancer Targeting Drug Vehicles to non-provisional US and International (PCT) patent applications. These patent applications further protect PDCs developed with Cellectar's proprietary phospholipid-ether delivery vehicle conjugated with any existing or future cytotoxic agents, including chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel, for targeted delivery to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Both composition of matter and methods of use are covered by these patent applications and provide intellectual property protection in the United States and up to 148 additional countries. This protection extends through at least November 2034 in the US and key international markets.

&#160;

CLR 131: We have been granted orphan status designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Orphan status designation provides for seven years of marketing exclusivity following US approval of CLR 131 for treatment of multiple myeloma. It is also covered by an additional series of our patents and applications aside from the Michigan patents (see below). The first is directed to a method of use for cancer therapy and has also been filed in Europe, Japan, and China, in addition to the U.S. We have two issued patents in the U.S., two in Europe and one in China, in addition to pending applications in the U.S. and Japan. These are expected to expire in 2025. Some of these resulting patents may be extendable on a country-by-country basis.

&#160;

CLR 1502 is covered by patents and patent applications directed to the compound, methods of use and method of manufacture that have been filed in U.S., Europe and Japan. A U.S. patent covering the composition and methods of use has already been issued and is expected to expire in 2030. Any additional patents resulting from these applications are also expected to expire in 2029. Some of these resulting patents may be extendable on a country-by-country basis.

&#160;

CLR 124: We have been granted orphan status designation for CLR 124 as a diagnostic for the management of glioma by the US FDA. Orphan status designation provides for seven years of marketing exclusivity following US approval of CLR 124 as a diagnostic for the management of gliomas. It is also covered by the Michigan patents (see below) as well as four of our U.S. patents, two of which are generally directed to detecting cancers, one of which is directed to its use for virtual colonoscopy that expires in 2029 and one of which is directed to its use for in vitro diagnostics that expires in 2027. CLR 124 is also covered by an issued European patent, and pending U.S., Japanese and Hong Kong patent applications that expire in 2025. Any patents issued from these applications would be expected to expire in 2025.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our proprietary rights also include patents and patent applications that are either owned by us or exclusively licensed to us by the University of Michigan (the &#8220;Michigan patents&#8221;). CLR 131, CLR 125 and CLR 124 are covered by the Michigan patents that provide compound (composition of matter) coverage in the U.S. and Canada and expire in 2016. Our patents and applications cover methods of use, composition and method of manufacture related to CLR 124, CLR 131, CLR 1502, CLR 125 and other PLEs. These patents and applications are filed in key commercial markets worldwide. These patents will generally expire between 2025 and 2030 unless extended, most likely under clinical development extensions.

&#160;

Separate from any patent protection and following product approval by regulatory authorities, data exclusivity may be available for various compounds for up to 10 years on a country-by-country basis (e.g., up to 5 years in the U.S. and up to ten years in Europe).

&#160;

In addition to the above noted patents/applications directed to CLR 131, CLR 125, CLR 124 and CLR 1502, we own other patents/applications directed to different forms of phospholipid ethers and methods of manufacturing of phospholipid ethers.

&#160;

We also own all intellectual property rights in the U.S. related to our clinical-stage pipeline compound, NOV-002, and other pre-clinical compounds based on oxidized glutathione. Issued composition-of-matter patents cover proprietary formulations of oxidized glutathione that expire in 2019, and these patents include methods of manufacture for oxidized glutathione formulated with various metals.

&#160;

Licenses / Collaborations 

&#160;

On December 14, 2015 the Company entered into an arrangement (the &#8220;MTA&#8221;) with Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre (&#8220;IRPF&#8221;). Under this arrangement, IRPF will provide a selection of its proprietary cytotoxics to the Company for use in an in vivo proof-of-concept study to evaluate the potential to create new drug conjugates (&#8220;NDCs&#8221;) in combination with the Company&#8217;s proprietary Phospholipid Drug Conjugate platform technology. The Company will own all intellectual property associated with the NDCs developed as part of the research collaboration. If the Company decides to further develop any of the NDCs for preclinical studies, the Company will enter into good faith discussions with IRPF to acquire an option to in-license the IRPF Materials. In the event that the Company proposes to enter into a business relationship with a third party for advancement of the NDCs, the Company will grant IRPF a right of first refusal to enter into the same business relationship, which will be exercisable by IRPF within 60 days. In the event that the Company does not choose to further develop the NDCs for preclinical studies and IRPF desires to do so within four years following expiration of this arrangement, the Company and IRPF will enter into good faith business discussions relating to IRPF&#8217;s use of the results of the study and certain of the Company&#8217;s proprietary technologies relating to the IRPF Materials. The Company has agreed to perform the study by December 14, 2017, and the Company&#8217;s obligation to grant a right of first refusal will continue for four years following the date on which the Company provides the results of the study to IRPF.

&#160;

In September 2003, Cellectar, Inc. entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan (the U. Mich. License), which granted Cellectar, Inc. exclusive rights to the development, manufacture and marketing of products under several composition of matter patents in North America that expire in December 2016. The U. Mich. License expires upon the expiration of the last covered patent. We are responsible for an annual license fee of $10,000 and are required to pay costs associated with the maintenance of the patents covered by the U. Mich. License. Additionally, we are required to make milestone payments of $50,000 upon the filing of a NDA for a licensed product intended for use in a therapeutic or diagnostic application (such milestone fees may be deferred and paid within twelve months of the first commercial sale of such product) and make certain milestone payments within a year following the first commercial sale of any licensed products. The sales milestones range from $100,000 to $200,000, dependent upon whether the drug is for use in a diagnostic or therapeutic application. If sales in the first 12 months are less than the amount of the milestone, then we are required to pay 50% of all sales until the milestone is satisfied. The milestone payments may total up to $400,000.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The U. Mich. License provides that we pay a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any licensed products sold by us or our sub licensees for such licensed products unless the sublicense fee payable to us is between 4% and 5% of net sales, then the royalties payable to U. Mich. shall be equal to 50% of the sublicense fee. Furthermore, the U. Mich. License provides for a reduction in the royalties owed by up to 50% if we are required to pay royalties to any third parties related to the sale of the licensed products. If we receive any revenue in consideration of rights to the licensed technology that is not based on net sales, excluding any funded research and development, we are required to pay U. Mich. 10% of amounts received. During 2003, pursuant to the U. Mich. License, Cellectar, Inc. paid approximately $54,000 of back patent costs and issued 203,483 shares of common stock to U. Mich. as partial consideration for the rights described above. U. Mich. may terminate the license agreement if we cease operations, fail to make any required payment under the license agreement, or otherwise materially breach the license agreement, subject to applicable notice and cure periods. To date, we have made all payments as they have become due, there have been no defaults under the U. Mich. License, nor have we ever been notified of a default by U. Mich. We may terminate the U Mich. License agreement with six months&#8217; notice to U. Mich. and the return of licensed product and related data. The U. Mich. License contains milestones that required certain development activities to be completed by specified dates. All such development milestones have been either completed or removed by subsequent amendment to the agreement. U. Mich. has provided no warranties as to validity or otherwise with respect to the licensed technology. The early termination of the University of Michigan License agreement would result in the loss of our rights to use the covered patents.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our primary activity to date has been research and development. We conduct our research and development program at our manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Our research and development expenses were approximately $5,159,000 and $5,964,000 for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

The production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our technology, and our development activities, are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including radioactive isotopes. These laws, and similar laws outside the United States, govern the clinical and pre-clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising, and promotion of drugs. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, if successful, will take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA&#8217;s and other health authorities&#8217; delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions.

&#160;

The following paragraphs provide further information on certain legal and regulatory issues with a particular potential to affect our operations or future marketing of products employing our technology.

&#160;

Research, Development, and Product Approval Process 

&#160;

The research, development, and approval process in the United States and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete. The typical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the United States includes:

&#160;

&#8226; pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices regulations, referred to herein as GLP; &#160;

&#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; &#160;

&#8226; human clinical studies performed under the FDA&#8217;s Good Clinical Practices regulations, to evaluate the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses; &#160;

&#8226; FDA review of whether the facility in which the drug is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued quality; and &#160;

&#8226; submission of a marketing application to the FDA, and approval of the application by the FDA. &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pre-clinical Testing 

&#160;

During pre-clinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. These studies are subject to GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically done in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new product candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety.

&#160; 

Submission of IND 

&#160;

An IND must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence. The IND must include a sufficient amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

Clinical trial programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological action of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients having the target disease or condition in order to validate clinical endpoints, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of effectiveness and safety of the product candidate as required by United States regulatory agencies.

&#160;

In the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results traditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as &#8220;Phase 1/2&#8221; studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human testing and a Phase 1/2 study carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.

&#160;

Before proceeding with a study, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). Among other things, SPAs can cover clinical studies for pivotal trials whose data will form the primary basis to establish a product&#8217;s efficacy. SPAs help establish upfront agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of a clinical trial design to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding if new circumstances arise. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA.

&#160;

United States law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be &#8220;adequate and well controlled.&#8221; In general, this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice requirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. The clinical trial process for a new compound can take ten years or more to complete. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated by institutional review boards, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can result in additional limitations being placed on a product&#8217;s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market.

&#160; 

Submission of NDA 

&#160;

Following the completion of clinical trials, the data is analyzed to determine whether the trials successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness and whether a product approval application may be submitted. In the United States, if the product is regulated as a drug, a NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA. The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process and determines that the facility is in compliance with cGMP requirements.

&#160;

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. For fiscal year 2015, the NDA review fee alone is $2,335,200, although certain limited deferral, waivers, and reductions may be available.

&#160;

Each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 45 to 60 days following submission of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will &#8220;file&#8221; the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs&#8212; six months for priority applications and 10 months for standard applications. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time.

&#160;

Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, typically is not an actual approval but an &#8220;action letter&#8221; that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. The FDA&#8217;s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.

&#160; 

Post NDA Regulation 

&#160;

Significant legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among other things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product advertising and promotion and ongoing adherence to cGMPs, as well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.

&#160;

The regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing and/or sale of our product pipeline may change significantly from the current descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our products to reach a point at which an NDA is approved.

&#160;

Overall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at FDA, the number of questions posed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA&#8217;s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials.

&#160; 

Other United States Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Heath Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our research and development, manufacturing and administration of our drugs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive materials, such as radioactive isotopes. Therefore, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of these materials and some waste products and are required to maintain both a manufacturer&#8217;s license and a radioactive materials license with State of Wisconsin agencies.

&#160;

Moreover, we are now, and may become subject to, additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and hazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work.

&#160;

Foreign Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

We, and any future collaborative partners, may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations that may be quite different from those of the FDA governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or any future collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in these countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.

&#160;

Reimbursement and Pricing Controls 

&#160;

In many of the markets where we or any future collaborative partners would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. For example, in the case of Medicare coverage for physician-administered oncology drugs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, with certain exceptions, prohibits Medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an FDA-approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, or the United States Pharmacopoeia Drug Information. Another commonly cited compendium, for example under Medicaid, is the DRUGDEX Information System.
