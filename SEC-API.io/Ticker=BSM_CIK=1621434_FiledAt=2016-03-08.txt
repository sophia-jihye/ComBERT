 ITEMS 1 AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

We are one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States. Our principal business is actively managing our existing portfolio of mineral and royalty assets to maximize its value and expanding our asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests. We maximize value through marketing our mineral assets for lease, creatively structuring terms on those leases to encourage and accelerate drilling activity, and selectively participating alongside our lessees on a working-interest basis in low-risk development-drilling opportunities on our mineral acreage. Our primary business objective is to grow our reserves, production, and cash generated from operations over the long term, while increasing, to the extent practicable, the distribution to our unitholders over time.

We own mineral interests in approximately 14.6 million acres, with an average 47.8% ownership interest in that acreage. We also own nonparticipating royalty interests in 1.3 million acres and overriding royalty interests in 1.4 million acres. These non-cost-bearing interests, which we refer to collectively as our &#8220;mineral and royalty interests,&#8221; include ownership in over 45,000 producing wells. Our mineral and royalty interests are located in 41 states and in 61 onshore basins in the continental United States. Many of these interests are in active resource plays, including the Bakken/Three Forks, Eagle Ford Shale, Wolfcamp, Haynesville/Bossier, and Fayetteville Shale plays, as well as emerging plays such as the Lower Wilcox and Canyon Lime plays. The combination of the breadth of our asset base and the long-lived, non-cost-bearing nature of our mineral and royalty interests exposes us to potential additional production and reserves from new and existing plays without investing additional capital. 

We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed on September 16, 2014. On May 1, 2015, our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;BSM.&#8221; On May 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 22,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price to the public of $19.00 per common unit.

BSM files or furnishes annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to these reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Through our website, http://www.blackstoneminerals.com, we make available electronic copies of the documents we file or furnish to the SEC. Access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. 

Recent Developments

Common Unit Repurchase Program

On March 4, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million in common units over the next six months. The repurchase program authorizes us to make repurchases on a discretionary basis as determined by management, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, available liquidity, and other appropriate factors. All or a portion of any repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common units to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common units and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to completion. We will periodically report the number of common units repurchased. The repurchase program will be funded from our cash on hand or available revolving credit facility. Any repurchased common units will be cancelled.

Cash Tender Offer

On November 6, 2015, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 100% of the 117,963 then outstanding preferred units from our preferred unitholders at the units&#8217; par value of $1,000.00 per preferred unit, plus unpaid accrued yield. The tender offer expired on December 10, 2015. We purchased and cancelled 40,747 preferred units, representing 34.5% of our then outstanding preferred units. The tendered units were purchased for $1,019.45 per preferred unit for a total cost of approximately $41.5 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer.

&#160;

Acquisitions 

We closed five separate transactions to acquire unproved oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin during 2015 for a total of $51.7 million. We acquired acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale play through two transactions totaling $9.7 million during 2015, and we also acquired an overriding royalty interest in the Utica Shale and Marcellus plays for $1.8 million.

Our Assets

As of December 31, 2015, our total estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 49,788 MBoe based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland Sewell and Associates (&#8220;NSAI&#8221;), an independent third-party petroleum engineering firm. Of the reserves as of December 31, 2015, approximately 89.6% were proved developed reserves (approximately 88.1% proved developed producing and 1.5% proved developed non-producing) and approximately 10.4% were proved undeveloped reserves. At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved reserves were 31.8% oil and 68.2% natural gas.

The locations of our oil and natural gas properties are presented on the following map. Additional information related to these properties follows this map.

&#160;

&#160;

Mineral and Royalty Interests

Mineral interests are real-property interests that are typically perpetual and grant ownership of the oil and natural gas under a tract of land and the rights to explore for, drill for, and produce oil and natural gas on that land or to lease those exploration and development rights to a third party. When those rights are leased, usually for a three-year term, we typically receive an upfront cash payment, known as lease bonus, and we retain a mineral royalty, which entitles us to a cost-free percentage (usually ranging from 20% to 25%) of production or revenue from production. A lessee can extend the lease beyond the initial lease term with continuous drilling, production, or other operating activities. When production or drilling ceases, the lease terminates, allowing us to lease the exploration 

&#160;

and development rights to another party. Mineral interests generate the substantial majority of our revenue and are also the assets that we have the most influence over. &#160;

In addition to mineral interests, we also own other types of non-cost-bearing royalty interests, which include:

&#160;

&#183; 

nonparticipating royalty interests (&#8220;NPRIs&#8221;), which are royalty interests that are carved out of the mineral estate and represent the right, which is typically perpetual, to receive a fixed, cost-free percentage of production or revenue from production, without an associated right to lease or receive lease bonus; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

overriding royalty interests (&#8220;ORRIs&#8221;), which are royalty interests that burden working interests and represent the right to receive a fixed, cost-free percentage of production or revenue from production from a lease. ORRIs remain in effect until the associated leases expire. 

Working-Interest Participation Program

We own working interests related to our mineral interests in various plays across our asset base. Many of these working interests were acquired through working-interest participation rights, which we often include in the terms of our leases. This participation right complements our core mineral-and-royalty-interest business because it allows us to realize additional value from our minerals. Under the terms of the relevant leases, we are typically granted a unit-by-unit or a well-by-well option to participate on a non-operated, working-interest basis in drilling opportunities on our mineral acreage. This right to participate in a unit or well is exercisable at our sole discretion. We generally only exercise this option when the results from prior drilling and production activities have substantially reduced the economic risk associated with development drilling and where we believe the probability of achieving attractive economic returns is high. A small portion of our working interests, unrelated to our mineral and royalty assets, were acquired because of the attractive working-interest investment opportunities on those properties. The majority of these assets are focused in the Anadarko Basin, and to a lesser extent, in the Permian and Powder River Basins.

We collectively refer to these working interests as our &#8220;working-interest participation program.&#8221; When we participate in non-operated working-interest opportunities, we are required to pay our portion of the costs associated with drilling and operating these wells. Our 2016 drilling capital expenditure budget associated with our working-interest participation program is approximately $60.0 million. Approximately 95% of our 2016 drilling capital budget will be spent in the Haynesville/Bossier and the Bakken/Three Forks plays, with the remainder spent in various plays including the Wolfcamp and Wilcox plays. As of December 31, 2015, we owned non-operated working interests in over 10,000 gross (269 net) wells. 

Working interest production represented 29.5% of our total production volumes during the year ended December 31, 2015.

We may own more than one type of interest in the same tract of land. For example, where we have acquired working interests through our working-interest participation program in a given tract, our working-interest acreage in that tract will relate to the same acre s as our mineral-interest acreage in that tract. Consequently, some of the acreage shown for one type of interest above may also be included in the acreage shown for another type of interest. Because of our working-interest participation program, overlap b etween working-interest acreage and mineral-and-royalty-interest acreage is significant, while overlap between the different types of mineral and royalty interests is not. Working-interest acreage excludes acreage that is not quantifiable due to incomplete seller records. &#160;

The basins and regions shown in the table are consistent with U.S. Geological Survey (&#8220;USGS&#8221;) delineations of petroleum provinces of onshore and state offshore areas in the continental United States. We refer to these petroleum provinces as &#8220;basins&#8221; or &#8220;regions.&#8221;

The following is an overview of the U.S. basins and regions we consider most material to our current and future business.

&#160;

&#183; 

Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins. The Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins region ranges from northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas through south central and southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. The Haynesville/Bossier plays, which have been extensively delineated through drilling, are the most prospective unconventional plays for natural gas production and reserves within this region. Approximately half of the Haynesville/Bossier plays&#8217; prospective acreage is within the Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins region, where we own significant mineral and royalty interests and working interests. There are a number of additional active conventional and unconventional plays in the basins in which we hold considerable mineral and royalty interests, including the Brown Dense, Cotton Valley, Hosston, Norphlet, Smackover, Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and Wilcox plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Western Gulf (onshore). The Western Gulf region, which ranges from South Texas through southeastern Louisiana, includes a variety of both conventional and unconventional plays. We have extensive exposure to the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, where we are experiencing a significant level of development drilling on our mineral interests within the oil and rich-gas and condensate areas of the play. In addition to the Eagle Ford Shale play, there are a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays to which we have exposure to in the region, including the Austin Chalk, Buda, Eaglebine (or Maness) Shale, Frio, Glenrose, Olmos, Woodbine, Vicksburg, Wilcox, and Yegua plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Williston Basin. The Williston Basin stretches through all of North Dakota, the northwest part of South Dakota, and eastern Montana and includes plays such as the Bakken/Three Forks plays, where we have significant exposure through our mineral and royalty interests as well as through our working interests. We are also exposed to other well-known plays in the basin, including the Duperow, Mission Canyon, Madison, Ratcliff, Red River, and Spearfish plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Palo Duro Basin. The Palo Duro Basin covers much of the Texas Panhandle but also occupies a small portion of the Oklahoma Panhandle and extends partially into New Mexico to the west. We have a significant acreage position in the Palo Duro Basin, much of which underlies an unconventional oil play in the Canyon Lime. We are also well positioned relative to a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays in the Palo Duro Basin, including the Brown Dolomite, Canyon Wash, Cisco Sand, and Strawn Wash plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Permian Basin. The Permian Basin ranges from southeastern New Mexico into West Texas and is currently one of the most active areas for drilling in the United States. It includes three geologic provinces: the Midland Basin to the east, the Delaware Basin to the west, and the Central Basin in between. Our acreage underlies prospective areas for the Wolfcamp play in the Midland and Delaware Basins, the Spraberry formation in the Midland Basin, and the Bone Springs formation in the Delaware Basin, which are among the plays most actively targeted by drillers within the basin. In addition to these plays, we own mineral and royalty interests that are prospective for a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays in the Permian Basin, including the Atoka, Clearfork, Ellenberger, San Andres, Strawn, and Wichita Albany plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Anadarko Basin. The Anadarko Basin encompasses the Texas Panhandle, southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and western Oklahoma. We own mineral and royalty interests as well as working interests in prospective areas for most of the prolific plays in this basin, including the Granite Wash, Atoka, Cleveland, and Woodford Shale plays. Other active plays in which we hold interests in prospective acreage include the Cottage Grove, Hogshooter, Marmaton, Springer, and Tonkawa plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Appalachian Basin. The Appalachian Basin covers most of Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, western Maryland, eastern Kentucky, central Tennessee, western Virginia, northwestern Georgia, and northern Alabama. The basin&#8217;s most active plays in which we have acreage are the Marcellus Shale and Utica plays, which cover most of western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. In addition to the Marcellus Shale, there are a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays to which we have material exposure in the Appalachian Basin, including the Berea, Big Injun, Devonian, Huron, Rhinestreet, and Utica plays. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

East Texas Basin. The East Texas Basin ranges from central East Texas to northeast Texas and includes the Haynesville/Bossier plays and the Cotton Valley play, which are among the most prolific natural gas plays in the basin. We own a material acreage position in the Shelby Trough area of the Haynesville/Bossier plays located in San Augustine and Nacogdoches Counties, which is one of the most active areas being drilled today for that play in the East Texas Basin. There are other active plays to which we have significant exposure, including the Bossier Sand, Goodland Lime, James Lime, Pettit, Travis Peak, Smackover, and Woodbine plays. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Arkoma Basin. The Arkoma Basin stretches from southeast Oklahoma through central Arkansas. The Fayetteville Shale play is one of the basin&#8217;s most significant unconventional natural gas plays. We own material mineral and royalty interests within the prospective area of the Fayetteville Shale. In addition, we have exposure to a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays in the basin, including the Atoka, Cromwell, Dunn, Hale, and Woodford Shale plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin. The Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin covers much of north central Texas and includes the Barnett Shale play as its most active unconventional play. Through our mineral and royalty interests in this basin, we have significant exposure to the Barnett Shale as well as a number of other active conventional and unconventional plays in the basin, including the Bend Conglomerate, Caddo, Marble Falls, and Mississippian Lime plays. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Southwestern Wyoming. The Southwestern Wyoming region covers most of southern and western Wyoming. The Pinedale Anticline is one of the region&#8217;s largest producing fields and mainly produces from the Lance formation. We have a meaningful position in the Pinedale Anticline, and we have interests prospective for other active plays as well, including the Mesaverde, Niobrara, and Wasatch plays. 

Interests by USGS Petroleum Province

The following tables present information about our mineral-and-royalty-interest and non-operated working-interest acreage, production, and well count by basin. We may own more than one type of interest in the same tract of land. For example, where we have acquired working interests through our working-interest participation program in a given tract, our working-interest acreage in that tract will relate to the same acres as our mineral-interest acreage in that tract. Consequently, some of the acreage shown for one type of interest below may also be included in the acreage shown for another type of interest. Because of our working-interest participation program, overlap between working-interest acreage and mineral-and-royalty-interest acreage is significant, while overlap between the different types of mineral and royalty interests is not significant.

The basins and regions shown in the table are consistent with USGS petroleum-province delineations.

Ownership interest is equal to the percentage that our undivided ownership interest in a tract bears to the entire tract. The per-basin average ownership interest shown reflects the weighted average of our ownership interests in all tracts in the basin. Our weighted-average mineral royalty for all of our mineral interests is approximately 20%, which may be multiplied by our ownership interest to approximate the average royalty interest in our mineral and royalty interests.

The average percent leased reflects the weighted average of our leased acres relative to our total acreage on a tract-by-tract basis in the basin.

We may own more than one type of interest in the same tract of land. For example, where we have acquired working interests through our working-interest participation program in a given tract, our working-interest acreage in that tract will relate to the same acres as our mineral-interest acreage in that tract. Consequently, some of the acreage shown for one type of interest above may also be included in the acreage shown for another type of interest. Because of our working-interest participation program, overlap between working-interest acreage and mineral-and-royalty-interest acreage is significant, while overlap between the different types of mineral and royalty interests is not significant. Working-interest acreage excludes acreage that is not quantifiable due to incomplete seller records.

The plays above have been delineated based on information from the EIA, the USGS, or state agencies or according to areas of the most active industry development.

&#160;

Interests by Resource Play 

The following tables present information about our mineral-and-royalty-interest and non-operated working-interest acreage, and production by resource play. As with the acreage shown for the basins above, we may own more than one type of interest in the same tract of land. Consequently, some of the acreage shown for one type of interest below may also be included in the acreage shown for another type of interest.

The plays above have been delineated based on information from the EIA, the USGS, or state agencies or according to areas of the most active industry development.

Ownership interest is equal to the percentage that our undivided ownership interest in a tract bears to the entire tract. The per-play average ownership interests shown above reflect the weighted average of our ownership interests in all tracts in the play. Our weighted-average mineral royalty for all of our mineral interests is approximately 20%, which may be multiplied by our ownership interest to approximate the average royalty interest in our mineral and royalty interests.

The average percent leased reflects the weighted average of our leased acres relative to our total acreage on a tract-by-tract basis in the play.

Estimated Proved Reserves

Evaluation and Review of Estimated Proved Reserves

The information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is based upon a reserve report prepared by NSAI, a third-party petroleum engineering firm, as of December 31, 2015.

NSAI provides worldwide petroleum property analysis services for energy clients, financial organizations, and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI summary reserve report incorporated herein is Mr. J. Carter Henson, Jr. Mr. Henson, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 73964), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1989 and has over 8 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering. As technical principal, Mr. Henson meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. NSAI does not own an interest in us or any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. A copy of NSAI&#8217;s estimated proved reserve report as of December 31, 2015 is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our third-party reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the data used to calculate our estimated proved reserves. Our internal technical team members met with our third-party reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the above referenced reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the reserve estimation process. We provided historical information to the third-party reserve engineers for our properties, such as oil and natural gas production, well test data, realized commodity prices, and operating and development costs. We also provided ownership interest information with respect to our properties. Brock Morris, our Senior Vice President, Engineering and Geology, is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. Mr. Morris is a petroleum engineer with approximately 30 years of reservoir-engineering and operations experience.

&#160;

The preparation of our historical proved reserve estimates were completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. Throughout the year, our technical team met with NS AI to review properties and discuss evaluation methods and assumptions used in the proved reserves estimates, in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures. Our internal controls over the reserves estimation process include verification of input data used in the reserves evaluation software as well as reviews by our internal engineering staff and management, which include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Comparison of historical operating expenses from the lease operating statements to the operating costs input in the reserves database; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Review of working interests and net revenue interests in the reserves database against our well ownership system; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Review of historical realized commodity prices and differentials from index prices compared to the differentials used in the reserves database; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Review of capital costs assumptions to actual historical capital costs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Review of actual historical production volumes compared to projections in the reserve report; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Discussion of material reserve variances among our internal reservoir engineers and our Senior Vice President, Engineering and Geology; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Review of preliminary reserve estimates by our President and Chief Executive Officer with our internal technical staff. 

Estimation of Proved Reserves

In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; means deterministically, the quantities of oil and/or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. All of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 are based on deterministic methods. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by using reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.

In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated net proved reserves NSAI employed technologies including, but not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps, and available down hole pressure and production data, seismic data, and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. In addition to assessing reservoir continuity, geologic data from well logs, core analyses, and seismic data were used to estimate original oil and natural gas in place. Recovery factors were determined utilizing reservoir simulation or analogy with similar reservoirs where similar drilling and completion techniques have been employed.

Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2015 were prepared using oil and natural gas prices equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month market price for each month in the period January through December 2015. For oil volumes, the average WTI spot oil price of $50.28 per barrel is used for estimates of reserves for all the properties as of December 31, 2015. These average prices are adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub price of $2.59 per MMBTU is used for estimates of reserves for all the properties as of December 31, 2015. These average prices are adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. Natural gas prices are also adjusted to account for NGL revenue since there is not sufficient data to account for NGL volumes separately in the reserve estimates. These reserve estimates exclude NGL quantities. When taking these adjustments into account, the average adjusted gas price weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties is $2.45 per Mcf. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas may vary substantially from these estimates.

Proved developed reserves of 84 MBoe as of December 31, 2015 were attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2015, no proved undeveloped reserves were attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries.

Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary for the same property. In addition, the results of drilling, testing, and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices, and future production rates and costs. Please read Part I, Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

Additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of BSM included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the estimated proved reserve reports as of December 31, 2015, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report.

&#160;

Estimated Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

As of December 31, 2015, our PUDs were composed of 345 MBbls of oil and 29,120 MMcf of natural gas, for a total of 5,198 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.

The following tables summarize our changes in PUDs during the year ended December 31, 2015 (in MBoe):

There were no PUD reserves acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015. New PUD reserves totaling 5,051 MBoe were added during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from drilling and capital expenditures in the Haynesville/Bossier, Bakken/Three Forks, and Wolfcamp plays.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had downward revisions of previous PUD reserve estimates totaling 101 MBoe, which were made up of 307 MMcf of natural gas reserve estimate revisions and 50 MBbl of oil reserve estimate revisions. Reductions of 45 MBoe are related to wells removed from PUD status as a result of stale permits or updated operator information, and 56 MBoe are related to revised reserve estimates for PUD locations in the Wolfcamp and Haynesville plays. 

Costs incurred relating to the development of locations that were classified as PUDs at December 31, 2014 were $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $58.7 million drilling and completing other wells which were not classified as PUDs as of December 31, 2014. Estimated future development costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 relating to the development of PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 are projected to be approximately $30.6 million. All of our PUD drilling locations as of December 31, 2015 are scheduled to be drilled within five years or less from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped reserves.

We generally do not have evidence of approval of our operators&#8217; development plans. As a result, our proved undeveloped reserve estimates are limited to those relatively few locations for which we have received and approved an authorization for expenditure and which remained undrilled as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 10.4% of our total proved reserves were classified as PUDs.

Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs 

Production and Price History

For the year ended December 31, 2015, 34.1% of our production and 58.5% of our oil and natural gas revenues were related to oil and condensate production and sales. During the same period, natural gas and natural gas liquids were 65.9% of our production and 41.5% of our oil and natural gas revenues.

As a mineral-and-royalty interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all value attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes.

Excludes the effect of commodity derivative instruments.

Productive Wells

Productive wells consist of producing wells, wells capable of production, and exploratory, development, or extension wells that are not dry wells. As of December 31, 2015, we owned mineral and royalty interests or working interests in 51,924 productive wells, which consisted of 31,967 oil wells and 19,957 natural gas wells. As of December 31, 2015, we owned mineral and royalty interests in 46,312 productive wells, which consisted of 31,136 oil wells and 15,176 natural gas wells, and working interests in 10,110 gross productive wells and 269 net productive wells, which consisted of 4,128 gross (55 net) productive oil wells and 5,982 gross (214 net) productive natural gas wells. We own both mineral and royalty interests and working interests in 4,498 of these wells.

Drilling Results for Our Working Interests

The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed on our properties during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, the quantities of reserves found, and the economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Environmental Matters 

Oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, which could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects. Numerous federal, state, and local governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), issue regulations that often require compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive, and other protected areas, require action to prevent, or remediate pollution from current or historic operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses, and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. The strict, joint, and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon our operators, or us as working-interest owners if the operator fails to perform, regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that impact our operators and result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Below is a summary of environmental laws applicable to our operators.

Waste Handling 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, these wastes typically constitute &#8220;solid wastes&#8221; that are subject to less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that RCRA could be amended or the EPA or state environmental agencies could adopt policies to require oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes to become subject to more stringent waste handling requirements. Administrative, civil, and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Any changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operators&#8217; capital expenditures and operating expenses, which in turn could affect production from our properties and adversely affect our business and prospects. 

Remediation of Hazardous Substances 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and analogous state laws generally impose strict, joint, and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility (which can include working-interest owners), a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on our properties use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold our operators, or us as working-interest owners if the operator fails to perform, responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean-up sites at which these &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; have been released. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221; (&#8220;CWA&#8221;), the Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;), the Oil Pollution Act (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA&#8217;s and the Corps&#8217; jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA&#8217;s jurisdiction, our operators could 

&#160;

face increased cost s and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pendin g resolution of the court challenge. In addition, spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the ev ent of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture, or leak. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water dis charges. &#160;

The OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil into surface waters. 

Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, in August 2012, the EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that established new emission control requirements for oil and natural gas production and processing operations. More recently, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit the ability of our operators to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for oil and natural gas producers and impact production on our properties, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Moreover, obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

Climate Change 

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect operations on our properties and restrict or delay the ability of our operators to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include operations on certain of our properties. More recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules adding new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers of hydraulically fractured wells. Also, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent in 2025. These rules could result in increased compliance costs for our operators and require them to make expenditures to purchase pollution control equipment. Consequently, these and other regulations related to controlling GHG emissions could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our operators&#8217; equipment and operations could require them to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon 

&#160;

dioxide that may be imposed in various states, as well as state and local climate change initiatives, could adversely affect the oil a nd natural gas industry, and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasi ng concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any of these effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our properties and operations. &#160;

&#160;

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Our operators engage in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The federal SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic-fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), however, has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program and issued guidance in February 2014 applicable to hydraulic fracturing involving the use of diesel fuel. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; proposed in April 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including, for example, notice to and pre approval by BLM of the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities; development and pre approval by BLM of a plan for managing and containing flowback fluids and produced water recovered during the hydraulic fracturing process; implementation of measures designed to protect usable water from hydraulic fracturing activities; and public disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued. 

Several governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board. In addition, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. These studies, depending on their results, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.

Several states where we own interests in oil and gas producing properties, including Colorado, North Dakota, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic-fracturing fluids. For example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (&#8220;RRC&#8221;) published a final rule in October 2014 governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that requires, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the RRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These existing or any new legal requirements establishing seismic permitting requirements or similar restrictions on the construction or operation of disposal wells for the injection of produced water likely will result in added costs to comply and affect our operators&#8217; rate of production, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our operators conduct operations, our operators may incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements, which may be significant in nature, experience delays, or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. 

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to increased risks of induced seismicity, the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic-fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, those laws could make it more difficult or costly for our operators to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, fracturing activities on our properties could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Legislative changes could cause operators to incur substantial compliance costs. At this time, it is not 

&#160;

possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing. &#160;

Occupational Safety and Health Act 

The OSHA and comparable state laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations, and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations on our properties and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. 

Endangered Species 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our properties may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, and previously unprotected species may later be designated as threatened or endangered in areas where we hold mineral interests. This could cause our operators to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, delay the completion of exploration and production activities, and/or result in limitations on operating activities that could have an adverse impact on our business. 

Title to Properties

Prior to completing an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on high-value tracts. Our title reviews are meant to confirm quantum of oil and natural gas properties acquired, lease status, and royalties as well as encumbrances and other related burdens. Depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion if we believe additional title due diligence is necessary. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. After an acquisition, we review the assignments from the seller for scrivener&#8217;s and other errors and execute and record corrective assignments as necessary.

In addition to our initial title work, our operators conduct a thorough title examination prior to leasing and drilling a well. Should our operators&#8217; title work uncover any title defects, either we or our operators will perform curative work with respect to such defects. Our operators generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until any material title defects on such property have been cured.

We believe that the title to our assets is satisfactory in all material respects. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions, and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens, and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects.

Marketing and Major Customers

If we were to lose a significant customer, such loss could impact revenue derived from our mineral-and-royalty-interest or working-interest properties. The loss of any single lessee is mitigated by our diversified customer base. The following table indicates our significant customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for the periods indicated:

Competition

The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of minerals and oil and natural gas leases, and personnel required to find and produce reserves. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess. Our ability to acquire additional minerals and properties and to discover reserves in the future will be 

&#160;

dependent upon our ability to identify and evaluate suitable acquisition prospects and to consumma te transactions in a highly competitive environment. Oil and natural gas products compete with other sources of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate sources of energy include coal, nuclear, solar and wind . Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other sources of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other sources of energy may affect the demand for oil and na tural gas. &#160;

Seasonal Nature of Business

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth quarters. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.

Employees

We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. All of our employees, including our executive officers, are employees of Black Stone Natural Resources Management Company (&#8220;Black Stone Management&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, Black Stone Management had 107 full-time employees. None of Black Stone Management&#8217;s employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements.

Facilities

Our principal office location is in Houston, Texas and consists of 58,261 square feet of leased space.
