OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

CohBar, Inc. (&#8220;CohBar,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leader in the research and development of mitochondria-based therapeutics (MBTs), an emerging class of drugs with potential for the treatment of diseases associated with aging. MBTs originate from the discovery by our founders of a novel group of peptides encoded within the genome of mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Our ongoing development of mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) into MBTs offers the potential to address a broad range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders.

&#160; 

Our scientific leadership is centered around the expertise of our founders, Dr. Pinchas Cohen, Dean of the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California, and Dr. Nir Barzilai, Professor of Genetics and Director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and is augmented by our co-founders, Dr. David Sinclair, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. John Amatruda, former Senior Vice President and Franchise Head for Diabetes and Obesity at Merck Research Laboratories. CohBar&#8217;s Chief Scientific Officer is Dr. Kenneth Cundy, former Chief Scientific Officer at Xenoport, Inc. and Senior Director of Biopharmaceutics at Gilead Sciences, Inc. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our founders and co-founders are widely considered to be scientific experts and thought leaders at the intersection of cellular and mitochondrial genetics and biology, the biology of aging, metabolism, and drug discovery, development and commercialization. The scientific research in the areas of mitochondrial genomics and biology, age-related diseases, longevity, and metabolism underlying our founder&#8217;s discoveries and our intellectual property portfolio was conducted by Drs. Cohen and Barzilai and their academic collaborators with the support of research grants aggregating over $30 million awarded to their respective academic institutions since 2001 by the National Institutes of Health, private foundations, and other grant-funding organizations. The multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientific leaders, and their investigations into and knowledge of age-related diseases, has enabled and focused our Company&#8217;s research efforts on the mitochondrial genome and its potential to yield peptides, which are biological molecules composed of a chain of bonded amino acids, for therapeutic advancement.

&#160;

Mitochondria are components within the cell that convert nutrients into a form of energy that cells can use, and regulate cell growth and death in response to signals received from the cell. They are the only cell components, other than the nucleus, that have their own genome. The mitochondrial genome has been left relatively unexplored as a focus of drug discovery efforts and, until recently, scientists believed that it was relatively limited containing only 37 genes as compared to the nuclear genome, which is estimated to contain upwards of 20,000 genes. Research by our founders and their academic collaborators has revealed that the mitochondrial genome has dozens of previously undiscovered potential genes that encode peptides, only several of which have been characterized to date. We refer to these as mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs). These peptides influence cellular activities by acting as hormones, or messengers between cells, triggering intra-cellular changes that affect cell growth and differentiation and play a role in metabolism.

&#160;

MDPs represent a diverse and largely unexplored collection of peptides, which we believe have the potential to lead to novel mitochondria-based therapeutics (MBTs) for a number of diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We believe that CohBar is a first mover in exploring the mitochondrial genome to identify MDPs with the potential to be developed into transformative medicines, and that the depth of our scientific expertise, together with our intellectual property portfolio, will enable us to sustain this competitive advantage. By augmenting our scientific leadership and MDP discoveries with drug discovery and development expertise and capabilities, we believe we can identify and develop MBT candidates that harness the MDP&#8217;s cell-signaling mechanisms to unlock the therapeutic potential of this collection of peptides. 

&#160;

We are the exclusive licensee from the Regents of the University of California and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of four issued U.S. patents, three U.S. patent applications and several related international patent applications in various international jurisdictions. Our licensed patents and patent applications include claims that are directed to compositions comprising MDPs and their analogs and/or methods of their use in the treatment of indicated diseases. See &#8220;Business &#8211; Patents and Intellectual Property&#8221;.

&#160; 

During 2015 we transitioned from our former lab in Pasadena, California to a new and expanded laboratory facility in Menlo Park, California. The new laboratory facility enabled us to expand our internal research and development capabilities. Our new location in Silicon Valley provides us with access to a large and experienced talent pool of scientific and laboratory personnel as we continue to grow our drug discovery and development operations.

&#160;

We were formed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware in 2007, and we incorporated in Delaware in 2009. We completed our initial public offering of common stock in January 2015.

&#160; 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

&#160; 

We aim to build a multi-product company based on our expertise in MDP biology and therapeutic drug development that, independently or together with strategic partners, discovers, develops and commercializes first and best-in-class medicines to treat a wide variety of diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#9679; advancing our founder&#8217;s MDP discoveries through the research and development of our lead programs; &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; continuing to leverage our expertise in mitochondrial biology discovery to identify new MDPs and expand our pipeline of research peptides; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; expanding our intellectual property portfolio relevant to mitochondria-based therapeutics (MBTs); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; supplementing and supporting our founders&#8217; expertise and efforts by continuing to build our own internal capability with additional scientific leadership, staff and facilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; leveraging relationships with academic partners and contract research organizations (CROs) to advance our research programs; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; developing strategic partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies and other organizations to support our research programs and future development and commercialization efforts. &#160; 

Our Lead Peptides 

&#160; 

Our research efforts to date have focused on discovering and evaluating our MDPs for potential development as MBT drug candidates. We seek to identify and advance research on MDPs with superior potential for yielding a drug candidate, and ultimately a drug, for which we have a strong intellectual property position. We also seek to take advantage of efficiencies that may be gained should a MBT drug candidate based on a single peptide prove effective for multiple indications. Based on our ongoing evaluation of MDPs currently in our research pipeline we are actively engaged in research on four MDPs for potential advancement into MBT drug candidate programs. We believe that the success of one of these possible MBT candidate programs, and further future development into a clinically effective therapeutic drug, while uncertain, could potentially address significant unmet medical needs. 

&#160;

MOTS-c 

&#160;

MOTS-c is an MDP discovered in 2012 by our founders and their academic collaborators. Research in cells and animal models indicates that MOTS-c plays a significant role in the regulation of metabolism and we believe a MOTS-c analog may have therapeutic potential for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as other diseases, such as obesity, fatty liver and certain cancers. Certain of these studies were subjected to peer review and published in an article entitled &#8220;The Mitochondrial-Derived Peptide, MOTS-c, Promotes Metabolic Homeostasis and Reduces Obesity and Insulin Resistance,&#8221; which appeared in the March 3, 2015 edition of the journal Cell Metabolism . We are advancing research on MOTS-c and its analogs as our lead program.

&#160;

SHLP-6 

&#160;

Our academic collaborators have discovered several other MDPs with similar mitochondrial origin to the first discovered MDP, humanin; we refer to these as small humanin-like peptides, or SHLPs. Of these peptides, our investigational research of SHLP-6 and its potential for the treatment of cancer is the most advanced. In cancer treatment models conducted both in cell culture and in mice, SHLP-6 demonstrated suppression of cancer progression via a dual mechanism involving suppression of tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel development) as well as induction of apoptosis (cancer cell death). We consider SHLP-6 as our leading research peptide for the potential treatment of cancer and plan to advance our research on optimization of SHLP-6 as an MBT candidate.

&#160;

SHLP-2 and Humanin 

&#160; 

Humanin, the first MDP to be discovered, demonstrated protective effects in various animal models of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial and cerebral ischemia and type 2 diabetes. Humanin levels in humans have been shown to decline with age, and elevated levels of humanin together with lower incidence of age-related diseases have been observed in centenarians as well as their offspring.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We also have evidence that another of our MDPs, SHLP-2, as well as certain of our humanin analogs, may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. In vitro experiments have shown SHLP-2 and these humanin analogs to have protective effects against neuronal toxicity, and have demonstrated that SHLP-2 and the humanin analogs may be transported through the blood-brain barrier. We consider SHLP-2, humanin and humanin analogs of potential interest for the development of MBT treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.

&#160;

Our Target Indications 

&#160;

Our drug discovery efforts are centered on identification of mitochondrial-derived peptides that have therapeutic potential to be advanced as drug candidates. Our research programs to date suggest multiple possible therapeutic indications for each of our lead peptides. While we believe any MBT drug candidates we identify would be advanced against one of the following diseases as a primary indication, it is possible that we may determine to advance a drug candidate for treatment of a different disease as a primary indication. We may determine to advance any future drug candidate against an alternative primary disease indication if, for example, additional data suggests greater therapeutic potential for the drug candidate against the alternative indication, or we determine that the development, approval or commercialization pathway may be more favorable for a drug candidate targeted against the alternative indication. 

&#160;

Type 2 diabetes &#8211; Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by a relative deficiency in insulin production and secretion by the pancreas and an inability of the body to respond to insulin normally, i.e. insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body&#8217;s systems, especially the nerves, kidneys, eyes and blood vessels. 

&#160;

Cancer &#8211; Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. This process is referred to as metastasis. Metastases are a major cause of death from cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cancer drugs such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy and other treatments are used to destroy cancer cells. The goal of cancer drugs is to cure the disease or, when a cure is not possible, to prolong life or improve quality of life for patients with incurable cancer. 

&#160; 

Alzheimer&#8217;s disease &#8211; In the brain, neurons connect and communicate at synapses, where tiny bursts of chemicals called neurotransmitters carry information from one cell to another. Alzheimer&#8217;s disrupts this process and eventually destroys synapses and kills neurons, damaging the brain&#8217;s communication network. There is no cure, and medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. There is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments. 

&#160; 

Atherosclerosis &#8211; Atherosclerosis is commonly referred to as a &#8220;hardening&#8221; or furring of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple atheromatous plaques within the arteries. This process is the major underlying risk for developing myocardial infarction (heart attack) as those plaques will either narrow the vessel or rupture, preventing blood flow in the coronary artery to parts of the heart muscle. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. Cholesterol lowering drugs are considered the main preventive approach to treat atherosclerosis, however these drugs are estimated to prevent only one-third of incidences of myocardial infarction, and there is significant unmet need for additional therapeutic options. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Competition may occur at any stage of research, development and commercialization. For example, a competitor may be granted a patent with a priority date preceding ours or may produce a compound that shows greater efficacy or better safety than ours during development studies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and capabilities for research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly during the research phase, either directly or through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

&#160;

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 

&#160; 

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of products which are generic or are otherwise less expensive to provide. 

&#160;

There are numerous therapies currently marketed to treat diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. These therapies are varied in their design, therapeutic application and mechanism of action and may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval. New products or therapies may also become available that provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed products and therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval. 

&#160;

If MOTS-c or analogs of MOTS-c are developed and approved for treatment of patients with diabetes, it would compete with several classes of drugs for type 2 diabetes that are approved to improve glucose control, including sulfonylureas, glinides, PPAR gamma agonists, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, DPP IV inhibitors, GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, bromocriptine and insulin. Insulin sensitizing agents approved to treat type 2 diabetes are the PPAR gamma agonists pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. These agents are not generic, are oral once-daily pills and are effective in lowering glucose and A1C. Metformin is also sometimes called an insulin sensitizer. It is available as a generic and comes in a once-daily formulation. Drugs approved for obesity may also be used to treat type 2 diabetes. In addition there are several investigational drugs being studied to treat type 2 diabetes and if these investigational therapies were approved they would also compete with a MOTS-c MBT. 

&#160;

If SHLP-6 (or MOTS-c) or an analog of either MDP is developed and approved as an MBT treatment for patients with cancer, it would compete with all approved therapies for the cancer it is approved to treat. Since the specific cancer that these investigational therapies might be approved to treat is unknown, they would theoretically compete with any pharmaceutical agent that is approved to treat cancer. In addition, there are several investigational drugs being studied to treat cancer, and if these investigational therapies were approved, they would also compete with SHLP-6 and MOTS-c.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If SHLP-2 (or humanin) or an analog of either MDP is developed and approved as an MBT treatment for patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, it would compete with all approved therapies to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s disease including donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne), memantine (Namenda), rivastigmine (Exelon) and tacrine (Cognex). In addition, there are several investigational drugs being studied to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s that, if approved, would also compete with SHLP-2 or humanin.

&#160;

FINANCING 

&#160;

Our business strategy and plans for research and development of our MDPs and MBT candidates includes periodic infusion of new capital to our company. We may seek to obtain funding for our business through partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or through the issuance and sale of our equity securities in capital raising transactions.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of March 28, 2016 we had 11 employees, all of whom were full-time. In addition to our employees, each of our founders serves as a consultant to the Company and consults directly with our employees and scientific staff to advance our research programs. Each of Drs. Cohen, Barzilai, Amatruda and Sinclair provide consulting services in the areas of peptide research, genetics, aging and age related diseases, drug discovery, development and commercialization and other areas relevant to our business pursuant to consulting agreements that provide for annual service terms. Additionally, from time to time we engage other subject-matter experts on a consulting basis in specific areas of our research and development efforts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160;

Research and development activities are central to our business model. Our research programs include activities related to discovery of MDPs, investigational research to evaluate the therapeutic potential of certain discovered MDPs and engineering analogs of certain discovered MDPs to improve their characteristics as potential MBT drug development candidates. Depending on factors of capability, cost, efficiency and intellectual property rights we conduct our research programs independently at our laboratory facility, pursuant to contractual arrangements with CROs or under collaborative arrangements with academic institutions. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,966,221 and $579,474, respectively. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

Patents 

&#160; 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and therapeutic methods, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our policy is generally to seek patent protection in the United States and in those international jurisdictions we identify as holding significant potential market opportunity for any drug we may develop and in which patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our intellectual property and patent strategy is focused on our MDPs and our MBTs. We typically seek composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patents for our MDPs and prospective MBTs based on pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic potential. We believe that the opportunity to engineer analogs or create combination therapies will afford us the opportunity to strengthen IP protection for our drug development candidates as they advance through our development pipeline and to broaden our IP protection internationally. 

&#160;

Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed fourteen years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. We currently have exclusive license rights to four issued patents that will expire starting in 2028.

&#160;

National and international patent laws concerning peptide therapeutics remain highly unsettled. Policies regarding the patent eligibility or breadth of claims allowed in such patents are currently in flux in the United States and other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we license, or may license or own in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our lead research peptides are described below: 

&#160;

Trade Secrets 

&#160;

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

&#160;

MOTS-c Exclusive License 

&#160;

On August 6, 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents to obtain worldwide, exclusive rights under patent filings and other intellectual property rights in inventions developed by Dr. Cohen and academic collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles. The intellectual property includes the pending U.S. and international patent filings described above under &#8220; MOTS-c Patent Coverage &#8221;. 

&#160;

We agreed to pay the Regents specified development milestone payments aggregating up to $765,000 for the first product sold under the license. Milestone payments for additional products developed and sold under the license are reduced by 50%. We are also required to pay annual maintenance fees to the licensors. Aggregate maintenance fees for the first three years following execution of the agreement are $7,500. Thereafter, we are required to pay maintenance fees of $5,000 annually until the first sale of a licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay the Regents royalties equal to 2% of our worldwide net sales of drugs, therapies or other products developed from claims covered by the licensed patent, subject to a minimum royalty payment of $75,000 annually, beginning after the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are required to pay the Regents royalties ranging from 8% of worldwide sublicense sales of covered products (if the sublicense is entered after commencement of phase II clinical trials) to 12% of worldwide sublicense sales (if the sublicense is entered prior to commencement of phase I clinical trials). The agreement also requires us to meet certain diligence and development milestones, including filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for a product covered by the agreement on or before the seventh anniversary of the agreement date.

&#160;

Under the agreement, the license rights granted to us are subject to any rights the U.S. Government may have in such licensed rights due to its sponsorship of research that led to the creation of the licensed rights. The agreement also provides that if the Regents become aware of a third-party&#8217;s interest in exploiting the licensed technologies in a field that we are not actively pursuing, then we may be obligated either to issue a sublicense for use in the unexploited field to the third-party on substantially similar terms or to actively pursue the unexploited field subject to appropriate diligence milestones. The agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving the Regents advance written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by the Regents in the event of our continuing material breach after notice of such breach and the opportunity to cure.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The pre-clinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our therapeutic candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and other laws. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products include, among other things, viruses, therapeutic serums, vaccines and most protein products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years, and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. 

&#160;

Regulatory approval will be required in all major markets in which we, or our licensees, seek to test our products in development. At a minimum, such approval requires evaluation of data relating to quality, safety and efficacy of a product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to these data differ depending on the territory, the drug involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development. 

&#160;

In general, new chemical entities are tested in animal models to determine whether the product is reasonably safe for initial human testing. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials typically involve the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into healthy human volunteers and focus on testing for safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. In the case of serious or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, initial Phase 1 trials are often conducted in patients directly, with preliminary exploration of potential efficacy. Phase 2 trials involve clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase 3 trials are generally expanded, well-controlled clinical trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the United States, specific pre-clinical data, chemical data and a proposed clinical study protocol, as described above, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective 30 days following receipt by the FDA. Phase 1 trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. Following completion of Phase 1 trials, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase 2 and 3 trials to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the trials to commence and could demand discontinuation of studies at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to regulatory review, a clinical trial involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body differ from country to country. In the United States, for example, each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board for any institution at which the clinical trial is conducted. This board considers among other factors, the design of the clinical trial, ethical factors, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution. 

&#160;

Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the approval process. Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product. 

&#160;

In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a new drug application, or NDA, for review by the FDA. The NDA requires information on the quality of the chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product and non-clinical and clinical data. 

&#160;

There can be no assurance that if clinical trials are completed that we or any future collaborative partners will submit an NDA or similar applications outside of the United States for required authorizations to manufacture or market potential products, or that any such applications will be reviewed or approved in a timely manner. Approval of an NDA, if granted at all, can take several months to several years, and the approval process can be affected by a number of factors. Additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. Regulatory authorities may conduct inspections of relevant facilities and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further, inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor adverse effects, or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect product marketability. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Moreover, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We expect to continue to rely upon third-party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of any products which are approved for marketing. We cannot be sure that those manufacturers will remain in compliance with applicable regulations, or that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

&#160;

Any of our future products approved by the FDA will likely be purchased principally by healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare products and services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for the products and services they provide is crucial to the success of new drug and biologic products. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products. Even if we were to develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers. 

&#160; 

If the FDA approves any of our future products and reimbursement for those products is approved by any federal or state healthcare programs, then we will be subject to federal and state laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, and federal and state anti-kickback laws that govern financial and other arrangements among drug manufacturers and developers and the physicians and other practitioners or facilities that purchase or prescribe products. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments that are intended to induce the use or prescription of medical products or services payable by any federal or state healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and could become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.
