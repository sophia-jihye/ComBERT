 Item 1. Business 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;ImmunoGen&#8221;, or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information is as of June 30, 2016 unless otherwise indicated. For a description of the risk factors affecting or applicable to our business, see &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; below. 

Company overview 

ImmunoGen is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops targeted cancer therapeutics using our proprietary antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology. An ADC with our technology comprises an antibody that binds to a target found on tumor cells conjugated to one of our potent anti-cancer agents as a &#8220;payload&#8221; to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its target. ADCs are an expanding approach to the treatment of cancer, with two approved products and the number of agents in development more than doubling during the last five years. 

We have established a leadership position in ADCs. Our technology is deployed in Roche&#8217;s Kadcyla&#174; (ado-trastuzumab emtansine), the first ADC to demonstrate superiority over standard of care in a randomized pivotal trial, EMILIA, and gain FDA approval. Following Kadcyla are 12 clinical-stage ADCs with our technology: four wholly-owned by us and eight through our partnerships with Amgen, Bayer, Biotest, Lilly, Novartis, and Sanofi. 

Our proprietary portfolio is led by mirvetuximab soravtansine, a first-in-class ADC targeting folate-receptor alpha, or FR&#945;. Following a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2016, we are initiating a Phase 3 registration trial, FORWARD I, with mirvetuximab soravtansine for use as single-agent therapy to treat patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR&#945; and who have received up to three prior treatment regimens. Additionally, we are accruing patients in a companion study, FORWARD II, to evaluate mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination regimens to expand the number of patients with ovarian cancer eligible for treatment with the ADC. FORWARD II consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with, in separate doublets, Avastin&#174; (bevacizumab), pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or PLD, and carboplatin. We have also entered into a collaboration with Merck under which Merck will provide Keytruda&#174; (pembrolizumab) for evaluation in combination with mirvetuximab soravtansine as part of the FORWARD II study. We expect to begin reporting clinical findings from FORWARD II in the second quarter of 2017. 

We have built a productive platform that continues to generate innovative and proprietary ADCs, including IMGN779, our CD33-targeting product candidate for acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. IMGN779 integrates one of our new DNA-alkylating IGN payload agents and is progressing through dose escalation in a Phase 1 trial in AML. We also are advancing IMGN632, a preclinical CD123-targeting ADC that uses an even more potent IGN payload agent with a new engineered linker and novel antibody, which we are developing for hematological malignancies including AML. 

In addition to fueling our organic growth, we also selectively license limited rights to use of our ADC technology to other companies. These licenses can provide us with cash through upfront and milestone payments, research and manufacturing support payments, and royalties on commercial sales, if any, as well as access to complementary technology and capabilities. The most advanced partner program is Roche&#8217;s marketed product, Kadcyla. 

Our strategy 

Our goal is to build a fully-integrated company capable of delivering innovative ADC therapies to cancer patients around the globe. We will attain this goal this goal by focusing on four strategic priorities: 

&#183; 

Complete development and commercialize mirvetuximab soravtansine. We are committed to executing on a speed-to-market strategy to complete development and obtain full approval for our lead program in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We have reviewed with the FDA the planned path to registration for mirvetuximab soravtansine and the design of our proposed Phase 3 trial, FORWARD I. With the benefit of the guidance provided by FDA, we are moving ahead with the study as designed and expect to enroll our first patient before year end. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Accelerate the development of our earlier-stage portfolio. We will prioritize product candidates with the highest potential for differentiation and, to this end, have emphasized ADCs deploying our new DNA-acting payload. With a potentially broad therapeutic index, we believe we can increase the number of cancers addressable by ADC therapies with this technology. 

&#183; 

Continue to drive innovation in ADCs. We have generated significant expertise in understanding the factors that drive successful development of ADCs. This understanding has produced a comprehensive set of capabilities for antibody, linker, and payload development and ADC manufacturing. We have paired this platform with an in-house team experienced in developing and commercializing oncology products from the bench to the patient. We believe this depth of know-how, capabilities, and experience has positioned us for sustained leadership in ADCs for oncology. 

&#183; 

Lever partnerships to extend the impact of innovation. We will continue to lever our platform to support our existing relationships and pursue new collaborations that expand the reach of our innovation, generate revenue, mitigate expenses, and expand our capabilities to enable more patients to be treated with ADCs deploying our technology. 

Having defined our strategic direction and corporate priorities, we have initiated a comprehensive review of our operations to ensure that we execute efficiently across the business and most effectively manage our cash. We expect to complete this review and communicate a revised operating plan before the end of 2016. 

ADCs and our technology platform 

ADCs represent an increasingly important approach to cancer therapy for both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In addition to two FDA-approved ADCs, the number of ADCs in development has more than doubled during the last five years to over 50 clinical candidates sponsored by more than 20 companies including Bayer, Lilly, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Takeda. Twelve of these 50 candidates utilize ImmunoGen&#8217;s technology, with additional ADCs in preclinical development. 

Our ADC platform technology combines advanced chemistry and biochemistry with innovative approaches to antibody optimization and engineering to generate novel product candidates designed to offer improved efficacy and/or tolerability for an expanding array of malignancies. Our platform-innovation programs focus primarily on increasing the diversity and potency of our payload agents, advancing antibody-payload linkage and release technologies, and integration of novel approaches to antibody engineering. 

We have developed tubulin-acting maytansinoid payload agents, which include DM1 and DM4. Our maytansinoid technology is utilized in Kadcyla, mirvetuximab soravtansine, anetumab ravtansine, and all other ADCs in development by us and our partners that entered the clinic prior to 2016. Recent laboratory studies conducted by ImmunoGen and academics indicate that maytansinoid ADCs can promote the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and help potentiate the effect of immuno-oncology agents. We have entered into a collaboration with Merck to assess mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Merck&#8217;s Keytruda in our Phase 1b/2 FORWARD II trial. 

We also have developed a new class of DNA-acting payload agents, our indolino-benzodiazepines, which we call IGNs. Our IGNs alkylate DNA without cross-linking it, which we have found to provide important tolerability benefits in preclinical models. Our IMGN779 and IMGN632 product candidates utilize our IGN payload agents, as does Takeda&#8217;s new GCC-targeting ADC. IGNs have the potential to markedly expand the opportunity for ADCs by enabling the development of effective, well-tolerated therapies for antigen targets not suitable for tubulin-acting approaches (e.g., due to limited antigen density or insensitivity to the mechanism of action). 

Other enabling technologies in our portfolio include our growing array of stable engineered linkers, which direct the release and activation of the payload agent inside the cancer cell, alternative methods of site-specific and non-site-specific attachment of payload to antibody, and alternative antibody assessment, engineering and targeting approaches. Our technology portfolio is designed to enable achievement of the most active, well-tolerated ADC for the target. In addition, we are collaborating with companies such as CytomX to gain access to novel approaches to antibody engineering such as masking technology.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine 

Mirvetuximab soravtansine is the first ADC to target FR&#945;, which is highly expressed on many ovarian cancers and some other types of solid tumors. Mirvetuximab soravtansine comprises an FR&#945;-binding antibody that serves to target the ADC to FR&#945;-positive cancer cells and our potent DM4 payload agent to kill the targeted cells. It is a potential treatment for FR&#945;-positive solid tumors including ovarian cancer and has been granted orphan drug status for ovarian cancer in the U.S. and the European Union, or the EU. 

Ovarian cancer &#8211; need for new treatment options 

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 240,000 new cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed globally each year. Ovarian cancer has the most deaths per year among gynecologic cancers, with the majority of patients diagnosed at an advanced stage. 

Standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer in the U.S. is a platinum-based regimen (e.g., carboplatin plus a taxane and potentially additional agents). Once the cancer becomes platinum resistant, a wide array of treatments may be used. Response rates with single-agent therapies (e.g., PLD, paclitaxel, topotecan) are limited &#8211; typically around 15% to 20%, with median progression-free survival, or PFS, of 3.5 to 4 months. 

Mirvetuximab soravtansine initial clinical testing 

We initiated Phase 1 testing of mirvetuximab soravtansine to assess, among other factors, its safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose, and to provide initial information on its anti-tumor activity. In the dose-finding stage, evidence of activity was seen in patients with FR&#945;-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Based on this experience, we opened an expansion cohort to prospectively evaluate mirvetuximab soravtansine, dosed at 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, specifically for the treatment of patients diagnosed with FR&#945;-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. 

To qualify for enrollment, patients needed to have platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with up to 5 prior treatment regimens. They also needed to have at least low FR&#945; expression on their tumor cells, defined as:

Findings in patients with FR&#945;-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer 

The data from this 46-patient cohort were presented at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2016. All of the patients enrolled had previously been treated with a platinum agent and with a taxane therapy; approximately two-thirds of the patients had received prior Avastin. Among the 46 patients, 23 had high, 14 had medium and 9 patients had low 

&#160;

expression of FR&#945; on their ovarian cancer. Half of the 46 patients had received 1, 2, or 3 prior regimens and half had received 4 or 5 prior regimens. 

The findings reported at ASCO include that, for the full 46-patient cohort, mirvetuximab soravtansine demonstrated favorable single-agent activity, with a confirmed (RECIST 1.1) objective response rate, or ORR, of 26% and a median PFS of 4.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 5.7 months). The greatest activity was seen among the patients who had high or medium expression of the target and had received up to 3 prior regimens.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine was generally well tolerated. Incidence and severity of blurred vision was reduced from 55%, mostly Grade 2 in the first 20 patients enrolled, to 39%, mostly Grade 1 (least severe), among the 26 patients enrolled after methods such as use of lubricating eye drops were introduced to manage this side effect. Other side effects reported in more than 20% of patients were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, increased AST, keratopathy and abdominal pain. 

&#160; 

Based on the single-agent activity seen with mirvetuximab soravtansine in difficult-to-treat platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, its safety and tolerability in the more than 160 patients treated to date, and our meeting with the FDA in July 2016, we are advancing this ADC into Phase 3 registration-enabling testing while also assessing it in combination regimens to potentially provide greater benefit to more patients. 

&#160; 

FORWARD I &#8211; single-agent therapy for platinum-resistant disease 

&#160; 

Our FORWARD I Phase 3 trial will assess mirvetuximab soravtansine as single-agent therapy for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who previously received up to three treatment regimens. To be eligible for enrollment, a patient&#8217;s ovarian cancer also must have high or medium FR&#945; expression using an in vitro diagnostic test developed by Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. that is advancing in conjunction with this trial. We estimate that 5,000 to 7,000 patients per year in the U.S. meet these criteria, with a comparable number in Europe. 

&#160; 

The Phase 3 trial design includes: (i) randomization of 333 patients 2:1 to mirvetuximab soravtansine or physician&#8217;s choice, chosen among PLD, topotecan, and weekly paclitaxel; (ii) PFS as the primary endpoint of the trial; (iii) powering the trial to enable separate assessment of the primary endpoint in the full study population and in the subset with high FR&#945; expression; and (iv) inclusion of an interim analysis for futility. 

&#160; 

Having met with the FDA to review the trial design, we expect to begin this Phase 3 trial in the fourth quarter of 2016. We currently anticipate having data from FORWARD I in 2019. 

&#160; 

FORWARD II &#8211; combination therapy for expanded patient population 

&#160; 

Cancer is often treated with combination regimens to enhance the treatment effect over single agents and to expand the eligible patient populations. Our FORWARD II Phase 1b/2 trial assesses mirvetuximab soravtansine in separate combinations with each of PLD, Avastin, and carboplatin, and is expected to begin evaluation with Merck&#8217;s Keytruda in the second half of 2016. To qualify for enrollment in FORWARD II, patients must have at least low FR&#945; expression on their tumor cells. Patients with platinum-sensitive disease will be eligible for treatment with a combination of mirvetuximab soravtansine and carboplatin. 

&#160; 

We expect to begin reporting clinical findings from FORWARD II in the second quarter of 2017. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

&#160;

We presently intend to market mirvetuximab soravtansine ourselves in the U.S. and in Europe and to partner it in other geographies. Expanding into earlier lines of treatment through use in combination regimens could significantly expand the opportunity. 

&#160; 

IMGN779 and IMGN632 &#8211; first-in-class ADCs for AML 

&#160; 

Our CD33-targeting IMGN779 product candidate for AML is the first ADC to use one of our new IGN payload agents that alkylate DNA without cross-linking it. 

&#160; 

In preclinical studies, ImmunoGen scientists found improvements in therapeutic index, the difference between efficacious doses and dose-limiting toxicity, between our DNA-alkylating IGN payloads and matched DNA cross-linking agents, including the avoidance of prolonged toxicity. 

&#160; 

We advanced IMGN779 into Phase 1 clinical testing for AML in April 2016 and expect to report the first clinical data with the agent in 2017. The IMGN779 Phase 1 trial will assess two schedules (weekly and biweekly administration) in the dose-finding stage and then utilize the selected dose and schedule in the planned expansion cohorts: (i) assessment in patients with AML in first relapse, and (ii) assessment in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. 

&#160; 

The first disclosure of IMGN632, our CD123-targeting ADC, was at the European Hematology Meeting in June 2016. This potential new therapy for AML and certain other hematologic malignancies utilizes a new ImmunoGen IGN payload and engineered linker as well as a novel antibody. It is in IND-enabling preclinical testing. 

&#160; 

IMGN529 and coltuximab ravtansine &#8211; novel ADCs for B-cell malignancies 

&#160; 

Our CD37-targeting ADC, IMGN529, has demonstrated single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory DLBCL in Phase 1 testing and striking synergy with rituximab in preclinical testing. IMGN529 is now in Phase 2 clinical testing in combination with rituximab. This novel ADC has orphan drug status for DLBCL in the U.S. 

Our CD19-targeting ADC, coltuximab ravtansine, has demonstrated single-agent, proof-of-concept activity in Phase 2 clinical testing. We believe this product candidate is best advanced in a combination regimen. 

Incidence of Relevant Cancers 

Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimates that in 2016 approximately 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. and that approximately 600,000 people will die from the disease. The total number of people living with cancer significantly exceeds the number of patients diagnosed with cancer in a given year as patients can live with cancer for a year or longer. Additionally, the potential market for anticancer drugs exceeds the number of patients treated as many types of cancer typically are treated with multiple compounds at the same time and because patients often receive a number of drug regimens sequentially. 

Below is information about incidence of cancers we are seeking to treat with our wholly-owned compounds. In our clinical testing, we will define treatment subgroups of patients for the cancer types referenced. 

&#183; 

Mirvetuximab soravtansine. Our mirvetuximab soravtansine compound is a potential treatment for ovarian cancer and potentially other cancers that highly express its target, FR&#945;. Based on published sources, we believe approximately 23,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

IMGN779 and IMGN632. Our IMGN779 and IMGN632 compounds are each a potential treatment for AML. Based on ACS estimates, we believe approximately 20,000 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

IMGN529 and coltuximab ravtansine. Our IMGN529 compound and our coltuximab ravtansine compound are potential treatments for a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, called DLBCL. Based on ACS estimates, we believe approximately 73,000 new cases of NHL will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Out &#8209;licenses and Collaborations 

We selectively license restricted access to our ADC technology to other companies to expand the utilization of our technology and to provide us with cash to fund our own product programs. These agreements typically provide the licensee with rights to use our ADC technology with its antibodies or related targeting vehicles to a defined target to develop products. The licensee is generally responsible for the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of any resulting product candidate. As part of these agreements, we are generally entitled to receive upfront fees, potential milestone payments, royalties on the sales of any resulting products and research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner&#8217;s request. We are also compensated for preclinical and clinical materials that we supply to our partners. 

We only receive royalty payments from our out &#8209;licenses after a product candidate developed under the license has been approved for marketing and commercialized. Additionally, the largest milestone payments under our existing collaborations usually are on later &#8209;stage events, such as commencement of pivotal clinical trials, product approval and achievement of defined annual sales levels. Achievement of product approval requires, at a minimum, favorable completion of preclinical development and evaluation, assessment of early &#8209;stage clinical trials, advancement into pivotal Phase II and/or Phase III clinical testing, completion of this later &#8209;stage clinical testing with favorable results, and completion of regulatory submissions and a positive regulatory decision.

Roche 

In 2000, we granted Genentech, now a unit of Roche, an exclusive license to develop and commercialize HER2-targeting ADCs with our maytansinoid technology. Roche&#8217;s Kadcyla resulted from this license. Kadcyla was approved for marketing in the U.S., EU and Japan in 2013 based on the findings in the EMILIA Phase 3 trial. We received a $2 million upfront payment from Roche upon execution of the agreement. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $44 million in milestone payments, of which we have received $34 million to date, and also tiered royalties on the commercial sales of Kadcyla or any other resulting products as described below. 

In 2015, Immunity Royalty Holdings, L.P., or IRH, paid us $200 million to purchase our right to receive 100% of the royalty payments on commercial sales of Kadcyla arising under our development and commercialization license with Genentech, until IRH has received aggregate Kadcyla royalties equal to $235 million or $260 million, depending on when the aggregate Kadcyla royalties received by IRH reach a specified milestone. Once the applicable threshold is met, if ever, we will thereafter receive 85% and IRH will receive 15% of the Kadcyla royalties for the remaining royalty term. 

The royalty term is determined on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis, and is initially 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of Kadcyla in the country. If, on such 10th anniversary, Kadcyla is covered by a valid claim under any patents controlled by us (excluding patents jointly owned by us and Genentech), then royalties remain payable on sales of Kadcyla in that country for an additional 2 years. 

The royalty rate is based on the calendar-year sales of Kadcyla in two territories: (1) the U.S. and (2) the rest of the world. For each territory, the rate is: 3% of net sales up to $250 million; 3.5% of net sales above $250 million and up to $400 million; 4% of net sales above $400 million and up to $700 million; and 5% of net sales above $700 million in the that territory during the calendar year. Royalties will be reduced to a flat 2% of net sales in any country at any time 

&#160;

during the royalty term in which Kadcyla is not covered by a valid claim under any patents controlled by us (excluding patents jointly owned by us and Genentech or solely owned by Genentech) in such country. 

The license agreement also provides for certain adjustments to the royalties payable to us if Genentech makes certain third party license payments in order to exploit the ADC technology components of Kadcyla, although such adjustments would in no event reduce the royalties payable for any country below the greater of 50% of the royalties otherwise payable with respect to sales of Kadcyla in such country, or 2% of net sales in such country. As of the date of this annual report on Form 10 &#8209;K, we are unaware of any facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to such an adjustment. 

Roche may terminate this agreement for convenience at any time upon 90 days&#8217; prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of Roche&#8217;s royalty obligations. 

In fiscal year 2014, we received two $5 million milestone payments in connection with marketing approval of Kadcyla in Japan and in the EU. 

Roche, through its Genentech unit, also has licenses for the exclusive right to use our maytansinoid ADC technology with antibodies to four undisclosed targets, which were granted under the terms of a separate, now expired 2000 right &#8209; to &#8209;test agreement with Genentech. For each of these licenses, we received a $1 million license fee and are entitled to receive up to a total of $38 million in milestone payments and also royalties on the sales of any resulting products. We have not received any milestone payments from these agreements through June 30, 2016. Roche is responsible for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of any products resulting from these licenses. 

Bayer 

In 2008, we granted Bayer an exclusive development and commercialization license to use our maytansinoid ADC technology with antibodies or other proteins that target mesothelin. We received a $4 million upfront payment upon execution of the agreement. We are also entitled to receive, for each product developed and marketed by Bayer under this agreement, up to a total of $170.5 million in milestone payments, plus tiered royalties between 4 - 7% on the commercial sales of any resulting products. 

Bayer has developed anetumab ravtansine under this agreement, and in 2016 initiated a Phase 2 trial designed to support marketing registration for which we received a $10 million milestone payment. 

Bayer may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time upon prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. We may also terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of specified events. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of Bayer royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Bayer royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement. 

Sanofi 

Collaboration Agreement 

In 2003, we entered into a broad collaboration agreement with Sanofi (formerly Aventis) to discover, develop and commercialize antibody based products. The collaboration agreement provided Sanofi with worldwide development and commercialization rights to new antibody based products directed to targets that were included in the collaboration, including the exclusive right to use our maytansinoid ADC technology in the creation of products developed to these targets. No further targets may be added to this agreement and the product candidates (targets) as of June 30, 2016 in the collaboration include isatuximab (CD38), SAR566658 (CA6), SAR408701 (CEACAM5) and one earlier-stage program that has yet to be disclosed. 

&#160;

The agreement may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of Sanofi&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Sanofi&#8217;s royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209; expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement. 

The collaboration agreement also provides us an option to certain co &#8209;promotion rights in the U.S. on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product basis. The terms of the collaboration agreement allow Sanofi to terminate our co &#8209;promotion rights if there is a change in control of ImmunoGen. 

We are entitled to receive milestone payments potentially totaling $21.5 million, per target, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. The total milestones are categorized as follows: development milestones&#8212;$7.5 million; and regulatory milestones&#8212;$14 million. Through June 30, 2016, we have received and recognized an aggregate of $20.5 million in milestone payments for compounds covered under this agreement now or in the past. 

Right &#8209;to &#8209;Test Agreement 

Under a separate, now expired right-to-test agreement, in 2013, Sanofi took one exclusive development and commercialization license. Under this license, we received an exercise fee of $2 million and are further entitled to receive up to a total of $30 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. The total milestones for each license are categorized as follows: development milestones&#8212;$10 million; and regulatory milestones&#8212;$20 million. 

Pursuant to the license agreement noted above, in 2015, Sanofi initiated Phase I, first-in-human clinical testing of its ADC product candidate, SAR428926 (LAMP1), triggering a $2 million development milestone payment to us which is included in license and milestone fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The SAR428926 development and commercialization license may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the license will continue in effect until the expiration of Sanofi&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Sanofi&#8217;s royalty obligations commence with the first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the development and commercialization license. 

Biotest 

In 2006, we granted Biotest an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid ADC technology for use with antibodies that target CD138. The product candidate indatuximab ravtansine is in development under this agreement. We received a $1 million upfront payment from Biotest upon execution of the agreement. We are also entitled to receive up to a total of $35.5 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Through June 30, 2016, we have received and recognized a total of $500,000 in milestone payments under this agreement. 

The agreement also provided us with the right to elect, at specific stages during the clinical evaluation of any compound created under the agreement, to participate in the U.S. development and commercialization of that compound in lieu of receiving the milestone payments not yet earned and royalties on sales in the U.S. Currently, we can exercise this right during an exercise period specified in the agreement by notice and payment to Biotest of an agreed upon opt &#8209;in fee of $15 million. Upon exercise of this right, we would share equally with Biotest the associated further costs of product development and commercialization in the U.S. along with the profit, if any, from product sales in the U.S. We would also be entitled to receive royalties, on a reduced basis, on product sales outside the U.S. 

Biotest may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time prior to our election to participate in the U.S. development and commercialization of a compound created under this agreement upon prior notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of Biotest&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Biotest&#8217;s royalty 

&#160;

obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement. 

Novartis 

Novartis took six exclusive development and commercialization licenses under a now-expired right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement established in 2010. We received a $45 million upfront payment in connection with the execution of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement in 2010, and for each development and commercialization license taken for a specific target, we received an exercise fee of $1 million and are entitled to receive up to a total of $199.5 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. The initial three &#8209;year term of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement was extended by Novartis in 2013 for an additional one &#8209;year period by payment of a $5 million fee to us. We also are entitled to receive payments for research and development activities performed on behalf of Novartis. Novartis is responsible for the manufacturing, product development and marketing of any products resulting from this agreement. 

In 2013, we and Novartis amended the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement so that Novartis could take a license to develop and commercialize products directed at two undisclosed, related targets, one target licensed on an exclusive basis and the other target initially licensed on a non &#8209;exclusive basis. The target licensed on a non &#8209;exclusive basis may no longer be converted to an exclusive target due to the expiration of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. We received a $3.5 million fee in connection with the execution of the amendment to the agreement. We may be required to credit this fee against future milestone payments if Novartis discontinues the development of a specified product under certain circumstances. 

In connection with the amendment, in 2013, Novartis took the license referenced above under the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement, as amended, enabling it to develop and commercialize products directed at the two targets. Additionally, the execution of this license provides us the opportunity to receive milestone payments totaling $199.5 million or $238 million, depending on the composition of any resulting products. Also, in 2013, Novartis took its second and third exclusive licenses to single targets, and in 2014, took three remaining exclusive licenses, each with the opportunity to receive milestone payments totaling $199.5 million, as outlined above, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. In January 2015 and May 2015, Novartis initiated Phase I, first-in-human clinical testing of its cKit-targeting ADC product candidate, LOP628, and P-cadherin-targeting ADC product candidate, PCA062, respectively, triggering a $5 million development milestone payment to us with each event. 

Novartis may terminate any development and commercialization license for convenience upon prior notice to us. Each license may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, each development and commercialization license will continue in effect until the expiration of Novartis&#8217; royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Novartis&#8217; royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in each license. 

Lilly 

Lilly took three exclusive development and commercialization licenses under a now expired right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement established in 2011. We received a $20 million upfront payment in connection with the execution of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement in 2011. Under the terms of this right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement, the first license had no associated exercise fee, and the second and third licenses each had a $2 million exercise fee. The first development and commercialization license was taken in 2013 and the agreement was subsequently amended to provide Lilly with an extension provision and retrospectively include a $2 million exercise fee for the first license in lieu of the fee due for either the second or third license. The second and third licenses were taken in 2014, with one including the $2 million exercise fee and the other not. Under the two licenses with the $2 million exercise fee, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $199 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Under the license taken in 2014 without the exercise fee, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $200.5 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. In September 2015, Lilly began Phase I evaluation of one of its ADC product candidates, FGFR3-targeting LY3076226, triggering a $5 million milestone payment to us which is included in license and milestone fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016. We also are entitled to receive payments for delivery of cytotoxic agents to Lilly and research and development activities performed on behalf of Lilly. Lilly is responsible for the manufacturing, product development and marketing of any products resulting from this collaboration. 

&#160;

Lilly may terminate any development and commercialization license for convenience upon prior notice to us. Each license may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. We may also terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of specified events. Unless earlier terminated, each development and commercialization license will continue in effect until the expiration of Lilly&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Lilly&#8217;s royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in each license. 

Amgen 

Amgen took three exclusive development and commercialization licenses under a now &#8209;expired right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement established in 2000. In 2013, Amgen took one non &#8209;exclusive development and commercialization license. Later in 2013, the non &#8209;exclusive license was amended and converted to an exclusive license, which Amgen sublicensed to Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd. In 2015, Amgen advised the Company that it had discontinued development of two product candidates, AMG 595 and AMG 172 that had been covered by two of Amgen&#8217;s four exclusive licenses, and in 2016, Amgen terminated these two licenses. For each of the two remaining development and commercialization licenses taken, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $34 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. The total milestones per license are categorized as follows: development milestones&#8212;$9 million; regulatory milestones&#8212;$20 million; and sales milestones&#8212;$5 million. Amgen (or its sublicensee(s)) is responsible for the manufacturing, product development and marketing of any products resulting from these development and commercialization licenses. 

In 2015, Amgen&#8217;s IND application under the remaining license not sublicensed to Oxford BioTherapeutics became effective, triggering a $1 million milestone payment to us which is included in license and milestone fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Amgen may terminate each development and commercialization license for convenience upon prior notice to us. Each license may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, each license will continue in effect until the expiration of Amgen&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Amgen&#8217;s royalty obligations commence with the first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in each development and commercialization license. 

CytomX 

In 2014, we entered into a reciprocal right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement with CytomX. The agreement provides CytomX with the right to test our payload agents and linkers with CytomX antibodies that utilize their proprietary antibody-masking technology, termed Probodies TM for a specified number of targets and to subsequently take an exclusive, worldwide license to use our technology to develop and commercialize Probody-drug conjugates directed to the specified targets on terms agreed upon at the inception of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. We received no upfront cash payment in connection with the execution of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. Instead, we received reciprocal rights to test our payload agents and linkers with ImmunoGen antibodies masked using CytomX technology to create Probody-drug conjugates directed to a specified number of targets and to subsequently take exclusive, worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize such conjugates directed to the specified targets on terms agreed upon at the inception of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. The terms of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement require us and CytomX to each take its respective development and commercialization licenses by the end of the term of the research license. In addition, both we and CytomX are required to perform specific research activities under the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement on behalf of the other party for no monetary consideration. 

In 2016, CytomX took its development and commercialization license for a specified target. An amendment of the agreement executed simultaneously with that license granted CytomX the right, for a specified period of time, to substitute the specified target with another as yet unspecified target. Accordingly, the revenue associated with this license is being deferred until the expiration of that substitution right. With respect to the development and commercialization license taken by CytomX, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $160 million in milestone payments plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. 

&#160;

With respect to any development and commercialization license that may be taken by us, we will potentially be required to pay up to a total of $80 million in milestone payments per license, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. 

In addition, each party may be liable to pay annual maintenance fees to the other party if the product candidate covered under a development and commercialization license has not progressed to a specified stage of development within a specified time frame. 

Takeda 

In 2015, we entered into a right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The agreement provides Takeda with the right to (a) take exclusive options, with certain restrictions, to individual targets selected by Takeda for specified option periods, (b) test our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology with Takeda&#8217;s antibodies directed to the targets optioned under a right &#8209;to &#8209;test, or research, license, and (c) take exclusive licenses to use our ADC technology to develop and commercialize products to targets optioned for up to two individual targets on terms specified in the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. Takeda must exercise its options for the development and commercialization licenses by the end of the three &#8209;year term of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement, after which any then outstanding options will lapse. Takeda has the right to extend the three &#8209;year right &#8209;to &#8209;test period for one additional year by payment to us of $4 million. Alternatively, Takeda has the right to expand the scope of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement by payment to us of $8 million. If Takeda opts to expand the scope of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement, it will be entitled to take additional exclusive options, one of which may be exercised for an additional development and commercialization license, and the right &#8209;to test period will be extended until the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement. Takeda is responsible for the manufacturing, product development and marketing of any products resulting from this collaboration. 

We received a $20 million upfront payment in connection with the execution of the right &#8209;to &#8209;test agreement and, for each development and commercialization license taken, are entitled to receive up to a total of $210 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. The first exclusive license, for GCC, was taken by Takeda in December 2015, and as a result, we recognized $8.6 million of the $25.9 million of arrangement consideration allocated to the development and commercialization licenses, which is included in license and milestone fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016. We also are entitled to receive payments for delivery of cytotoxic agents to Takeda and research and development activities performed on behalf of Takeda. 

Takeda may terminate any development and commercialization license for convenience upon prior notice to us. Each license may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. Unless earlier terminated, each development and commercialization license will continue in effect until the expiration of Takeda&#8217;s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. For each product and country, Takeda&#8217;s royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last &#8209;to &#8209;expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in each license. 

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 

Our intellectual property strategy centers on obtaining patent protection for our proprietary technologies and product candidates. As of June 30, 2016, our patent portfolio had a total of 765 issued patents worldwide and 749 pending patent applications worldwide. We seek to protect our ADC technology and our product candidates through a multi &#8209;pronged approach. In this regard, we have patents and patent applications covering antibodies and other cell &#8209;binding agents, linkers, cell &#8209;killing agents ( e.g. , tubulin &#8209;acting maytansinoids and DNA &#8209;acting cell &#8209;killing agents), and complete ADCs, comprising these components and methods of making and using each of the above. Typically, multiple issued patents and pending patent applications cover various aspects of each product candidate. 

We consider our cell &#8209;killing agent technology to be a key component of our overall corporate strategy. We currently own 59 issued U.S. patents covering various embodiments of our maytansinoid technology including claims directed to certain maytansinoids, antibody &#8209;maytansinoid conjugates and other cell &#8209;binding agents used with maytansinoids, and methods of making and using the same. In all cases, we have received or are applying for comparable patents in other jurisdictions including Europe and Japan. We have issued patents that cover numerous aspects of the manufacture of both our DM1 and DM4 cell &#8209;killing agents. These issued patents remain in force until various times between 2020 and 2033. We also have several composition of matter patents covering various aspects of 

&#160;

our DM4 cell &#8209;killing agent and antibody &#8209;maytansinoid conjugates incorporating DM4 that are expected to remain in force until 2024 &#8209;2033. We have nine issued U.S. patents covering various aspects of our DNA &#8209;acting cell &#8209;killing agents, which will expire at various times between 2030 and 2035. We also have nine additional pending U.S. patent applications disclosing and claiming other related embodiments of this technology. Patents that may issue from these applications will, if issued, expire between 2030 and 2036. In all cases, we are also applying for comparable patents in other jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. 

Our intellectual property strategy also includes pursuing patents directed to linkers, antibodies, conjugation methods, ADC formulations and the use of specific antibodies and ADCs to treat certain diseases. In this regard, we have issued patents and pending patent applications related to many of our linker technologies. These issued patents, expiring in 2021 &#8209;2031, and any patents which may issue from the patent applications, cover antibody &#8209;maytansinoid conjugates using these linkers. We also have issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications covering methods of assembling ADCs from their constituent antibody, linker and cell &#8209;killing agent moieties. These issued patents will expire in 2021 &#8209;2032, while any patents that may issue from pending patent applications also covering various aspects of these technologies will, if issued, expire between 2021 and 2037. We also have issued patents and pending patent applications related to monoclonal antibodies that may be a component of an ADC compound or may be developed as a therapeutic, or &#8220;naked,&#8221; antibody anticancer compound. 

We expect our continued work in each of these areas will lead to other patent applications. In all such cases, we will either be the assignee or owner of such patents or have an exclusive license to the technology covered by the patents. 

The rates at which we are entitled to receive royalties based on sales of Kadcyla in any particular country depend in part on whether the manufacture, use or sale of Kadcyla is covered by ImmunoGen patent rights in that country. In this regard, we own patents in the U.S. and Europe covering the composition of matter of Kadcyla that expire at the earliest in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and may be eligible for extension of those terms under applicable patent laws in those jurisdictions. We also own patents in the U.S. and Europe that cover various elements of the manufacture of Kadcyla, with expiration dates extending to at least 2027 and 2026, respectively. Notwithstanding these patent terms, the period during which we are entitled to receive royalties based on sales of Kadcyla in any country does not extend beyond the 12 th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of Kadcyla in such country. 

We cannot provide assurance that the patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents, if issued, will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products, technologies or processes. Defining the scope and term of patent protection involves complex legal and factual analyses and, at any given time, the result of such analyses may be uncertain. In addition, other parties may challenge our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings resulting in a partial or complete loss of certain patent rights owned or controlled by ImmunoGen, Inc. Furthermore, as a patent does not confer any specific freedom to operate, other parties may have patents that may block or otherwise hinder the development and commercialization of our technology. 

On October 29, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTAB, instituted an inter partes review, or IPR, of the claims in our U.S. Patent No. 8,337,856, or the &#8217;856 Patent, that covers Kadcyla. The PTAB issued a Final Written Decision on the matter in which all claims of the &#8217;856 were held to be not unpatentable. The Petitioner has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or CAFC. Briefs have been filed and we expect the CAFC to hear Oral Argument in the first quarter of 2017 and issue a final decision in second quarter of 2017. The &#8217;856 Patent is one of several U.S. patents we hold that pertain to Kadcyla. Consequently, any adverse outcome of the Appeal is not expected to impact either the royalty revenue we are entitled to receive from Roche on Kadcyla sales in the U.S., or the $200 million royalty monetization transaction relating to our Kadcyla royalty stream that was consummated in 2015. 

Many of the processes and much of the know &#8209;how that are important to us depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel, which skills, knowledge and experience are not patentable. To protect our rights in these areas, we require that all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Further, we require that all employees enter into assignment of invention agreements as a condition of employment. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these agreements will provide adequate or any meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know &#8209;how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know &#8209;how or proprietary information. Further, in the absence of patent protection, we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know &#8209;how or other proprietary information. 

&#160;

Competition 

We focus on highly competitive areas of product development. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology firms. For example, Pfizer, Seattle Genetics Roche, Takeda, AbbVie and Bristol &#8209;Myers Squibb have programs to attach a cell &#8209;killing small molecule to an antibody for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as other institutions, also compete with us for promising targets for antibody &#8209;based therapeutics and in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. Additionally, there are non &#8209;ADC therapies available and/or in development for the cancer types we and our partners are targeting. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. 

In particular, competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include: 

&#183; 

the safety and efficacy of products; 

&#183; 

the timing of regulatory approval and commercial introduction; 

&#183; 

special regulatory designation of products, such as Orphan Drug designation; and 

&#183; 

the effectiveness of marketing, sales, and reimbursement efforts. 

Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop effective proprietary products, implement clinical development programs, production plans and marketing plans, including collaborations with other companies with greater marketing resources than ours, and to obtain patent protection and secure sufficient capital resources. 

Continuing development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. Antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, new antibodies or other targeted therapies may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell &#8209;killing agents for attachment to antibodies. These companies may compete with us for technology out &#8209;license arrangements. 

Regulatory Matters 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record &#8209;keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, 

&#160;

or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, or other applicable regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials according to current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 

&#183; 

development and approval of a companion diagnostic device if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. 

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 &#8209;day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on &#8209;going or proposed clinical trials or non &#8209;compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#183; 

Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life &#8209;threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#183; 

Phase II: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#183; 

Phase III: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are 

&#160;

intended to establish the overall risk &#8209;benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post &#8209;approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 

The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase III clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 

According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a special protocol assessment and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is required to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. If the sponsor makes any unilateral changes to the approved protocol, the agreement will be invalidated. 

For some of our product candidates, including mirvetuximab soravtansine and potentially others, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. 

If a sponsor or the FDA believes that an in vitro companion diagnostic is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a sponsor of an in vitro companion diagnostic to develop the drug and the related diagnostic at the same time. In vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA issued a final guidance document in 2014, entitled &#8220; In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices&#8221; that is intended to assist companies developing a therapeutic product for which the use of an IVD test provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product and companies developing those IVD tests. Such tests, where the test results are essential rather than just helpful, were designated IVD companion diagnostic devices. It also issued a draft guidance on July 15, 2016, entitled, &#8220;Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product&#8221; to serve as a practical guide to assist therapeutic product sponsors and IVD sponsors in developing a therapeutic product and an accompanying IVD companion diagnostic. 

The FDA indicated that it will apply a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory pathway for IVD companion diagnostic devices, as it does with all medical devices. This means that the regulatory pathway will depend on the level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the IVD companion diagnostic device and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The two primary types of marketing pathways 

&#160;

for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. We expect that any IVD companion diagnostic device developed for use with our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway and that a clinical trial performed under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, will have to be completed before the PMA may be submitted. 

The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required. 

The sponsor of the IVD companion diagnostic device will be required to comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements that apply to clinical trials of significant risk devices. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IDE and IND requirements. 

PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. 

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval order or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will send the applicant a not approvable letter or an order denying approval. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 

There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA &#8209;regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the 

&#160;

product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial &#8209;related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

The results of product development, preclinical and other non &#8209;clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth substantive review. FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP &#8209;compliant to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. 

NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be 6 months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life &#8209;threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well &#8209;controlled Phase IV clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 

After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase III trial or other significant and time &#8209;consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further 

&#160;

assess a drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non &#8209;compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 

The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non &#8209;compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Amendments. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one &#8209;half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, an additional six months of marketing exclusivity may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If the Written Request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received any Written Requests. 

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of &#8220;generic&#8221; biologics&#8212;biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve &#8209;year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve &#8209;year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity 

&#160;

and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. 

The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 

An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances. 

The FDA has issued a number of final and draft guidances in order to implement the law. On April 28, 2015, the FDA issued the following four final guidances: &#8220;Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product,&#8221; &#8220;Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product,&#8221; and &#8220;Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry,&#8221; and &#8220;Formal Meetings between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants&#8221; issued November 17, 2015. The draft guidances include: &#8220;Clinical Pharmacology Data to Support a Demonstration of Biosimilarity to a Reference Product&#8221; issued May 13, 2014, &#8220;Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act&#8221; issued August 4, 2014, and &#8220;Biosimilars: Additional Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009,&#8221; issued May 12, 2015. 

The guidance documents provide FDA&#8217;s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. The FDA intends to issue additional guidance documents in the future, and has identified considerations in demonstrating interchangeability to a reference product, labeling and nonproprietary naming as several of the issues that it hopes to address in calendar year 2015. Nonetheless, the absence of final guidance documents covering all biosimilars issues does not prevent a sponsor from seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA, and the FDA recently approved two biosimilar applications in the U.S. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity, except in very limited circumstances. The FDA issued a final rule, effective August 12, 2013, intended to clarify several regulatory provisions, among which was a clarification of some of those limited circumstances. One of the provisions makes clear that the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusive approval if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to a previously approved drug, regardless of whether or not the approved drug was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. Thus orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. 

&#160;

The FDA and the European Union granted Orphan Drug designation to mirvetuximab soravtansine, or IMGN853, when used for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Orphan drug designation provides us with seven years of market exclusivity that begins once mirvetuximab soravtansine receives FDA marketing approval for the use for which the orphan drug status was granted. Orphan medicinal product designation provides ImmunoGen with ten years of market exclusivity that begins once mirvetuximab soravtansine receives European approval for the use for which it was granted. We also have been granted Orphan Drug designation for IMGN529 by the FDA and the European Union for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and may pursue these designations for other indications for other product candidates intended for qualifying patient populations. 

Expedited Review and Approval 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life &#8209;threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre &#8209;BLA or pre &#8209;NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post &#8209;marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial. 

In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law&#8217;s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. The FDA published a final guidance on May 30, 2014, entitled &#8220;Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions&#8212;Drugs and Biologics.&#8221; One of the expedited programs added by FDASIA is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end &#8209;of &#8209;Phase II meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase I and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. FDA has already granted this designation to at least 60 new drugs and seven to date have received approval. 

Post &#8209;Approval Requirements 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future 

&#160;

inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record &#8209;keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more &#8220;concerned&#8221; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#8220;reference&#8221; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan &#8209;designated product. 

Reimbursement 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third &#8209;party reimbursement. Third &#8209;party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third &#8209;party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third &#8209;party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost &#8209;effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost &#8209;effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost &#8209;effective. It is time consuming 

&#160;

and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third &#8209;party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 

Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand &#8209;alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. 

Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in &#8209;patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors&#8217; offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer &#8209;reported average sales price which is regularly updated. We believe that most of our drugs, when approved, will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for this research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third &#8209;party payors do not consider our products to be cost &#8209; effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA) enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. ACA has resulted in expanded coverage for the uninsured and is expected to help contain overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have stated their intentions to not implement certain sections of ACA and some members of Congress are still working to repeal ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of ACA. 

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower. 

Research and Development Spending 

During each of the three years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $148.1 million, $111.8 million and $107.0 million, respectively, on research and development activities.

Raw Materials and Manufacturing 

We procure certain raw material components of finished conjugate, including antibodies, cytotoxic agents, and linker, for ourselves and on behalf of our collaborators. In order to meet our commitments to our collaborators as well as our own needs, we are required to enter into agreements with third parties to produce these components well in advance of our production needs. Our principal suppliers for these components include Boehringer Ingelheim, BSP Pharmaceuticals S.r.l., SAFC, Inc., Carbogen Amcis and Societ&#224; Italiana Corticosteroidi S.r.l. 

In addition, we operate a conjugate manufacturing facility. A portion of the cost of operating this facility, including the cost of manufacturing personnel, is incurred to conjugate material on behalf of our collaborators for which we receive payments based on the number of batches of preclinical and clinical materials produced on their behalf. Over the past few years, we have expanded and upgraded the capabilities of our manufacturing facility. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, we had 385 full &#8209;time employees, of whom 330 were engaged in research and development activities. Of the 330 research and development employees, 172 employees hold post &#8209;graduate degrees, of which 78 hold Ph.D. degrees and six hold M.D. degrees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

We have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, members of our board of directors and consultants. Further, we have entered into assignment of invention agreements with all of our employees.
