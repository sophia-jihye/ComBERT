BACKGROUND 

&#160; 

Originally incorporated in June 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. Following the business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company, the Company changed its name to Providential Securities, Inc. (Nevada) in January 2000. The Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc. in February 2000. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and Philand Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation (a Nevada corporation), and began to mainly focus on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural resource businesses. Starting July 2016, the Company has engaged Milost Advisors, Inc., a New York-based investment-banking firm, as its buy-side advisor and begun to seek acquisition opportunities in other industries besides energy and natural resources. In addition, PHI Capital Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, continues to provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&#38;A) advisory and consulting services for other companies in a variety of industries.
