 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The Corporation 

The Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") &#32;is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S.") &#32;that was created in 1933 by legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in response to a request by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. TVA was created to, among other things, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, reduce the damage from destructive flood waters within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, further the economic development of TVA&#8217;s service area in the southeastern United States, and sell the electricity generated at the facilities TVA operates. Today, TVA operates the nation&#8217;s largest public power system and supplies power to a population of over nine million people. 

TVA manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity. Consistent with these primary purposes, TVA also manages the river system to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, natural resource protection, and economic development. TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies which have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system. In addition, the TVA Board of Directors (the "TVA Board") &#32;established two councils &#8212; the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council &#8212; under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities. 

Initially, all TVA operations were funded by federal appropriations. Direct appropriations for the TVA power program ended in 1959, and appropriations for TVA&#8217;s stewardship, economic development, and multipurpose activities ended in 1999. Since 1999, TVA has funded all of its operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity and power system financings. TVA&#8217;s power system financings consist primarily of the sale of debt securities and secondarily of alternative forms of financing such as lease arrangements. As a wholly-owned government corporation, TVA is not authorized to issue equity securities. 

&#160; 

Service Area 

TVA's service area, the area in which it sells power, is defined by the TVA Act. TVA supplies power in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Kentucky and in portions of northern Georgia, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Under the TVA Act, subject to certain minor exceptions, TVA may not, without specific authorization from the U.S. Congress, enter into contracts that would have the effect of making it, or the local power company customers of TVA ("LPCs") &#32;which distribute TVA power, a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its LPCs were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957. This provision is referred to as the &#8220;fence&#8221; because it bounds TVA&#8217;s sales activities, essentially limiting TVA to power sales within a defined service area. 

Note 

See Power Supply and Load Management Resources &#32; &#8212; Coal-Fired for a discussion of coal-fired units . &#160; 

In addition, the Federal Power Act ("FPA") &#32;includes a provision that helps protect TVA&#8217;s ability to sell power within its service area. This provision, called the "anti-cherrypicking" provision, prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") &#32;from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines to others to deliver power to customers within TVA&#8217;s defined service area. As a result, the anti-cherrypicking provision reduces TVA&#8217;s exposure to loss of customers. 

&#160; 

In 2016 , the revenues generated from TVA&#8217;s electricity sales were $10.5 billion &#32;and accounted for virtually all of TVA&#8217;s revenues. TVA&#8217;s revenues by state for each of the last three years are detailed in the table below.

Customers 

TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power, selling power to LPCs which then resell power to their customers at retail rates. TVA&#8217;s LPCs consist of (1) municipalities and other local government entities ("municipalities") &#32;and (2) customer-owned entities ("cooperatives") . These municipalities and cooperatives operate public power electric systems whose primary purpose is not to make a profit but to supply electricity to the general public or the cooperative's members. TVA also sells power directly to certain end-use customers, primarily large commercial and industrial loads and federal agencies with loads larger than 5,000 kilowatts ("kW") . Whether TVA or a LPC serves a new power customer is determined by reference to the TVA-LPC wholesale power contract. The contract contains a formula that balances the size of the LPC and the amount of any TVA infrastructure investment to determine which party is entitled to serve the new customer. In addition, power in excess of the needs of the TVA system may, where consistent with the provisions of the TVA Act, be sold under exchange power arrangements with other specific electric systems.

Local Power Companies 

Revenues from LPCs accounted for approximately 91 &#32;percent of TVA&#8217;s total operating revenues in 2016 . At September 30, 2016 , TVA had wholesale power contracts with 154 &#32;LPCs. Each of these contracts requires the LPC to purchase from TVA all of its electric power and energy consumed within the TVA service area. Nearly all LPCs purchase power under contracts that require five, ten, twelve, or fifteen years notice to terminate. 

&#160; 

The number of LPCs with the contract arrangements described above, the revenues derived from such arrangements in 2016 , and the percentage of TVA&#8217;s 2016 &#32;total operating revenues represented by these revenues are summarized in the table below.

Note 

(1) Ordinarily, the LPCs and TVA have the same termination notice period; however, in contracts with five of the LPCs with five-year termination notices, TVA has a 10-year termination notice (which becomes a five-year termination notice if TVA loses its discretionary wholesale rate-setting authority). Two of the LPCs have five-year termination notices or a shorter period if any act of Congress, court decision, or regulatory change requires or permits that election. Also, under TVA&#8217;s contract with Bristol Virginia Utilities, a five-year termination notice may not be given by the LPC until January 2018. 

TVA&#8217;s two largest LPCs &#8212; Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") &#32;and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") &#32;&#8212; have contracts with five-year and 10-year termination notice periods, respectively. Although no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of TVA&#8217;s total operating revenues in 2016 , sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively. 

The power contracts between TVA and LPCs provide for the purchase of power by LPCs at the wholesale rates established by the TVA Board. Under Section 10 of the TVA Act, the TVA Board is authorized to regulate LPCs to carry out the purposes of the TVA Act through contract terms and conditions as well as through rules and regulations. TVA regulates LPCs primarily through the provisions of TVA&#8217;s wholesale power contracts. All of the power contracts between TVA and the LPCs require that power purchased from TVA be sold and distributed to the ultimate consumer without discrimination among consumers of the same class and prohibit direct or indirect discriminatory rates, rebates, or other special concessions. In addition, there are a number of wholesale power contract provisions through which TVA seeks to ensure that the electric system revenues of the LPCs are used only for electric system purposes. Furthermore, almost all of these contracts specify the specific resale rates and charges at which the LPC must resell TVA power to its customers. These rates are revised from time to time, subject to TVA approval, to reflect changes in costs, including changes in the wholesale cost of power. The regulatory provisions in TVA&#8217;s wholesale power contracts are designed to carry out the objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective of providing for adequate supply of power at the lowest feasible rates. See Rates &#32;&#8212; Rate Methodology &#32;below. 

TVA also regulates LPC policies for customer deposits, termination, information to consumers, and billing through a service practice policy framework. The framework provides for consistent regulatory policy for ratepayers across the Tennessee Valley, while recognizing local considerations. 

Other Customers 

Revenues from directly served industrial customers accounted for approximately six &#32;percent of TVA&#8217;s total operating revenues in 2016 . Contracts with these customers are subject to termination by the customer or TVA upon a minimum notice period that varies according to the customer&#8217;s contract demand and the period of time service has been provided. TVA also serves eight federal customers, &#8206;including U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") &#32;facilities and military installations, which accounted for approximately one percent of TVA&#8217;s total operating revenues in 2016. 

Rates 

Rate Authority 

The TVA Act gives the TVA Board sole responsibility for establishing the rates TVA charges for power. These rates are not subject to judicial review or to review or approval by any state or federal regulatory body. Under the TVA Act, TVA is required to charge rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for: 

&#8226; 

Operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system; 

&#8226; 

Payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents") ; 

&#8226; 

Debt service on outstanding indebtedness; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Payments to the U.S. Treasury in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment") ; and 

&#8226; 

Such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness ("Bonds") &#32;in advance of maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA&#8217;s power business. 

In setting TVA&#8217;s rates, the TVA Board is charged by the TVA Act to have due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. 

Rate Methodology 

In view of demand for electricity, the level of competition, and other relevant factors, it is reasonable to assume that rates, set at levels that will recover TVA's costs, can be charged and collected from customers. Further, the TVA Board has the discretion to determine when costs will be recovered in rates. As a result of these factors, TVA records certain assets and liabilities that result from the self-regulated ratemaking process that could not otherwise be so recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. See Note 1 &#32;&#8212; Cost-Based Regulation and Note 7 . 

In setting rates to cover the costs set out in the TVA Act, TVA uses a wholesale rate structure that is comprised of a base rate and a fuel rate that is automatically determined each month by the operation of the fuel cost adjustment formula. In setting the base rates, TVA uses a debt-service coverage ("DSC") &#32;methodology to derive annual revenue requirements in a manner similar to that used by other public power entities that also use the DSC rate methodology. Under the DSC methodology, rates are calculated so that an entity will be able to cover its operating costs and to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on debt. This ratemaking approach is particularly suitable for use by entities financed primarily, if not entirely, by debt capital, such as TVA. 

TVA's revenue requirements for costs or projected costs (other than the fuel, purchased power, and related costs 

covered by the fuel rate) are calculated under the DSC methodology in order to produce gross revenues sufficient to fund requirements specified in the TVA Act listed under Rate Authority &#32;above . 

The DSC methodology reflects the cause-and-effect relationship between TVA's costs and the corresponding rates it 

charges for its regulated products and services. Once the revenue requirements (or projected costs) are determined, they are compared to the projected revenues for the year in question, at existing rates, to arrive at the shortfall or surplus of revenues as compared to the projected costs. Power rates are adjusted by the TVA Board to a level deemed to be sufficient to produce revenues approximately equal to projected costs (exclusive of the costs collected through the fuel rate). 

A comprehensive rate restructuring was approved by the TVA Board on August 21, 2015, and implemented on October 1, 2015. With the exception of the annual rate adjustment, changes to rates were designed to be revenue neutral to TVA with varying off-setting impacts to individual customers. 

The rate restructuring resulted in structural changes to base rates to improve cost alignment with capacity-related on-peak demand charges and seasonal time-of-use ("TOU") &#32; energy rates that differ by on-peak and off-peak periods to better reflect generation costs. Minor changes in revenue allocation were made to improve alignment with cost-of-service, to keep industrial rates competitive, and to keep residential rates affordable. The 2015 TOU rate was unanimously adopted by TVA&#8217;s LPCs and by the vast majority of TVA&#8217;s directly served customers. 

TVA recovers fuel costs and tax equivalents associated with fuel cost adjustments through a monthly rate adjustment reflective of the costs paid by TVA for fuel. Prior to fiscal year 2016, all customers paid the same monthly base fuel rate. On August 21, 2015, the TVA Board approved a new methodology to more accurately allocate fuel costs to two groups of customers: Standard Service (residential and small commercial customers) and Non-Standard Service (large commercial and industrial customers), each with a different monthly fuel rate more reflective of their group&#8217;s contribution to total fuel costs. Fuel costs are now allocated to these customer groups in relation to their average hourly loads and TVA's hourly incremental dispatch costs. Total monthly fuel costs include costs for natural gas, fuel oil, coal, purchased power, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities as well as realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities. 

In 2013, the Board approved continuing the collection of the Environmental Adjustment ("EA") &#32;charges through the Adjustment Addendum to fund investment in environmental projects. TVA&#8217;s existing EA was modified in 2015 to conform to the new wholesale and large-customer base rate designs. While revised slightly, the EA was designed to collect approximately the same revenue as before the rate structuring, approximately $421 million and $439 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

On August 25, 2016, the TVA Board approved the annual base rate adjustment with the goal of increasing fiscal year 2017 revenues by approximately $200 million. This increase equates to an approximate 2.4 percent wholesale rate adjustment. 

&#160; 

The Board also took action to approve a revision of the Real Time Energy ("RTE") &#32;rate to enhance competitiveness in the north Georgia market segment. 

TVA is currently discussing with its customers the need for a rate change to continue the improvements to wholesale pricing begun in 2015, including improved pricing signals; improved rate alignment between wholesale and retail rates; simplification of rates where possible; and improvements to cost recovery and competitive pricing structures. These steps are important to support the TVA Act objective of providing power at the lowest feasible rates. 

Power Supply and Load Management Resources 

General 

Power generating facilities operated by TVA at September 30, 2016 , included 29 &#32;conventional hydroelectric sites, one pumped-storage hydroelectric site, eight coal-fired sites, three nuclear sites, 15 natural gas and/or oil-fired sites, one diesel generator site, 14 solar &#32;energy sites, digester gas cofiring capacity at one coal-fired site, biomass cofiring potential (located at coal-fired sites), and one wind energy site, although certain of these facilities were out of service as of September 30, 2016 . See Item 2, Properties &#8212; Generating Properties &#8212; Net Capability &#32;for a discussion of these facilities. TVA also acquires power under power purchase agreements of varying durations including short-term contracts of less than 24-hours in duration. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; &#32;Financial Results &#8212; Operating Expenses . 

TVA intends to balance production capabilities with power supply requirements by promoting the conservation and efficient use of electricity and, when necessary, buying, building, or leasing assets or entering into power purchase agreements. TVA also intends to employ a diverse mix of energy generating sources and is working toward obtaining greater amounts of its power supply from clean (low or zero carbon emitting) resources. 

The following charts show TVA's generation and purchased power by generating source as a percentage of all electric power generated and purchased (based on kWh) for the periods indicated: 

Note 

Renewable resources (non-hydro) from TVA facilities are less than one percent for all periods shown, and therefore are not represented on the charts above. Purchased power contains the majority of non-hydro renewable energy supply. 

Coal-Fired 

TVA began its coal-fired plant construction program in the 1940s, and its coal-fired units were placed in service between 1951 and 1973. Coal-fired units are either active or retired. TVA considers units to be in an active state when the unit is generating, available for service, or temporarily unavailable due to equipment failures, inspections, or repairs. All other coal-fired units are considered retired. As of September 30, 2016 , TVA had eight coal-fired plants consisting of 35 &#32;active units, accounting for 10,285 &#32;MW of summer net capability, and 24 retired units: Colbert Fossil Plant ("Colbert") &#32;Units 1-5, John Sevier Fossil Plant ("John Sevier") &#32;Units 1-4, Johnsonville Fossil Plant ("Johnsonville") &#32;Units 5-10, Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee") &#32;Unit 10, and Widows Creek Fossil Plant ("Widows Creek") &#32;Units 1-8. 

Coal-fired plants have been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements over the last few decades, including those under the Clean Air Act ("CAA") &#32;and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Increasing regulatory costs have caused TVA to consider whether or not to make the required capital investments to continue operating these coal-fired facilities. In April 2011, TVA entered into two agreements (collectively, the "Environmental Agreements") to address a dispute under the CAA. The first agreement is a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") . The second agreement is with Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups: the Sierra Club, National Parks Conservation Association, and Our Children&#8217;s Earth Foundation. Under the Environmental Agreements, TVA agreed to retire 18 of its 59 coal-fired units by the end of 2017 and was generally absolved from any liability, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, under the New Source Review ("NSR") &#32;requirements of the CAA for maintenance, repair, and 

&#160; 

component replacement projects that were commenced at TVA's coal-fired units prior to the execution of the agreements. TVA also agreed to retire, repower, or install air pollution controls on 16 of the remaining coal-fired units. Failure to comply with the terms of the Environmental Agreements would subject TVA to penalties stipulated in the agreements. TVA is taking the actions necessary to comply with the Environmental Agreements. TVA is confident that it has adequate capacity to meet the needs of its customers after units are retired under the Environmental Agreements. See Natural Gas &#32; and/or Oil-Fired &#32;below and Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Generation Resources &#32; &#8212; Coal-Fired Units.

&#160; 

Notes 

(1) Selective catalytic reduction systems ("SCRs") 

(2) If TVA decides to add emission controls to these units, TVA must continuously operate the emission controls once they are installed. 

(3) Convert to renewable biomass 

After TVA completes the actions described in the above table, TVA anticipates that it will have 7,891 MW of summer net capability of coal-fired generation, a reduction of 6,682 MW from TVA's coal-fired capacity as of September 30, 2010. TVA is moving towards a more balanced generation plan with greater reliance on lower-cost and cleaner energy generation technologies. &#32;&#32; TVA&#8217;s long-range plans will continue to consider the costs and benefits of significant environmental investments at its remaining coal-fired plants. 

&#160; 

Nuclear 

At September 30, 2016 , TVA had three nuclear sites consisting of six units in operation and one unit in pre-commercial operations. The units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry") &#32;are boiling water reactor units, and the units at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") &#32;and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant ("Watts Bar") &#32;are pressurized water reactor units. Statistics for each of these units are included in the table below.

(1) Watts Bar Unit 2 began commercial operations on October 19, 2016. 

Watts Bar Unit 2 . On October 22, 2015, the NRC approved the operating license for Watts Bar Unit 2. The license will expire in 2055. Load of fuel was completed in December 2015, and Unit 2 achieved initial criticality on May 23, 2016. The Unit 2 generator was initially synchronized to the TVA power system on June 3, 2016. Power ascension testing on Unit 2 was successfully completed, and commercial operations commenced on October 19, 2016 following the completion of a pre-commercial operations period. &#32; &#32;Project costs were within the $4.7 billion limit approved by the TVA Board in January 2016. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#8212; Generation Resources &#8212; Watts Bar Unit 2 and Note 20 &#32;&#8212; Legal Proceedings &#32;&#8212; Case Involving Watts Bar Unit 2 Operating License , which discussions are incorporated herein by reference. 

Extended Power Uprate . TVA is undertaking an extended power uprate ("EPU") &#32;project at Browns Ferry that is expected to increase the amount of electrical generation capacity of its reactors. The license for each reactor must be modified to allow reactor operation at the higher power level. 

Because the license amendment requests ("LARs") &#32;submitted by TVA to the NRC at the beginning of this project have been under review for an extended time due to uprate-related technical issues, the original amendment request was withdrawn and resubmitted in September 2015. If approved, the license amendment would allow all three units at Browns Ferry to increase capacity by 20 percent over original power levels, inclusive of projects previously completed on Units 1, 2, and 3 which resulted in a five percent increase in capacity. 

TVA expects to begin implementing the EPU project starting in the spring of 2018 for Unit 3, the fall of 2018 for Unit 1, and the spring of 2019 for Unit 2, and TVA expects to complete the project in 2024. The project involves engineering analyses and modification and replacement of certain existing plant components to enable the units to produce the additional power requested by the license amendments. These improvements will be ongoing in parallel with the NRC&#8217;s license amendment review process. The project is estimated to cost approximately $475 million and expected to add 465 MW of generating capacity.

Other Nuclear Initiatives . TVA has submitted an early site permit license application to the NRC to license small modular reactors ("SMRs") &#32;at TVA&#8217;s Clinch River Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Generation Resources &#32;&#8212; Small Modular Reactors .

&#160; 

Hydroelectric and Other Renewable Energy Resources 

Conventional Hydroelectric Dams . TVA maintains 29 &#32;conventional hydroelectric dams with 109 generating units throughout the Tennessee River system for the production of electricity. At September 30, 2016 , these units accounted for 3,771 MW of summer net capability. The amount of electricity that TVA is able to generate from its hydroelectric plants depends on a number of factors, including the amount of precipitation and runoff, initial water levels, and the need for water for competing water management objectives. The amount of electricity generated from these facilities also depends on the availability of TVA's hydroelectric generation plants. When these factors are unfavorable, TVA must increase its reliance on higher cost generation plants and purchased power. In addition, a portion of energy generated by nine U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE") &#32;dams on the Cumberland River system contribute to the TVA power system. See Weather and Seasonality below and &#32; Item 7, &#32; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#8212; Dam Safety and Remediation Initiatives. 

Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a unique reversible turbine/generator that acts as a pump and a turbine. During 2011, the unit&#8217;s breakers experienced a major failure and a decision was made not to restore its pumping capabilities at the time. The conventional generation capability continued to operate. However, because the pump enhances TVA's ability to balance baseload generation, it was restored during 2016. Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a summer net capability of 86 MW. 

Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant . The four &#32;units at Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant ("Raccoon Mountain") &#32;were placed in service during 1978 and 1979. The units, with a total net summer capability of 1,616 &#32;MW, are utilized to balance the transmission system as well as generate power. TVA uses electricity generated by its coal-fired and nuclear plants at night to operate pumps that fill the reservoir at Raccoon Mountain. Then, during the day, when power prices are higher, the water is released and the pumps reverse to work as power generating turbines. The cost of generation at Raccoon Mountain, therefore, is linked to the cost of the generating plants that are used to power the pumps. 

Hydro Modernization Program . In 1992, TVA began a Hydro Modernization Program to address reliability issues related to its hydroelectric units. At September 30, 2016 , modernization had been completed on 57 conventional hydroelectric units and Raccoon Mountain. The modernization projects resulted in 433 MW of increased capacity from the conventional hydroelectric units, with an average efficiency gain of approximately five &#32;percent. Hydroelectric generation will continue to be an important part of TVA's energy mix so TVA continues to assess its remaining conventional hydroelectric units for opportunities to improve reliability through major maintenance projects. 

Other Renewable Energy Resources . TVA's renewable energy portfolio includes both TVA-owned assets and renewable energy purchases. TVA owns 14 solar &#32;sites and capability for digester gas and biomass cofiring. The digester gas cofiring capability is accounted for as coal-fired generation summer net capability. The TVA-owned solar sites provide less than one MW of summer net capability. 

TVA tracks its renewable energy claims through the management of renewable energy certificates ("RECs") . These are principally associated with non-hydro renewable energy. In 2016, TVA retired 3,448,945 RECs, which were principally from purchased power. Additionally, TVA retires RECs on behalf of customers in the Green Power Switch &#174; &#32;("GPS") program and other customer-based programs that enable customers to claim RECs. 

Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired 

On September 30, 2016 , TVA&#8217;s natural gas- and oil-fired fleet consisted of 99 &#32;combustion turbine power blocks ( 87 &#32;simple-cycle units and 12 &#32;combined-cycle power blocks). The 87 &#32;simple-cycle units provide a maximum of 5,738 &#32;MW of summer net capability. The 12 &#32;combined-cycle power blocks provide a maximum of 4,572 &#32;MW of summer net capability. Eighty of the simple-cycle units and one combined-cycle power block are fueled by either natural gas or fuel oil. The remaining seven simple-cycle units and the remaining 11 combined-cycle power blocks are fueled by natural gas only. Sixty of the simple-cycle units are currently capable of quick-start response allowing full generation capability in approximately 10 minutes. The economic dispatch of natural gas-fired plants depends on both the day-to-day price of natural gas and the price of other available intermediate resources like coal-fired plants. TVA uses simple-cycle units to meet peaking or backup power needs. 

TVA&#8217;s strategy of portfolio diversification and air emissions reductions includes the addition of natural gas-fired plants to its generation fleet. At September 30, 2016 , TVA had two natural gas-fired generation facilities under construction. One facility, with an expected generation capacity of approximately 1,000 MW, is being constructed at TVA&#8217;s Paradise Fossil Plant ("Paradise") &#32;site. This facility is expected to be completed in the spring of 2017. A second facility, with an expected generation capacity of approximately 1,000 MW, is being constructed at the Allen Fossil Plant ("Allen") &#32;site and is expected to be completed in 2018. Upon completion of each facility, existing coal-fired units at each site will be retired with the exception of Paradise Unit 3, which will continue to be operated. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Generation Resources &#32;&#8212; Natural Gas-Fired Units . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

See Item 2, Properties &#8212; Generating Properties and &#32; Note 12 &#32; for a discussion of lease arrangements into which TVA has entered in connection with certain combustion turbine units. Because of TVA's strategy of portfolio diversification and reduction of air emissions, TVA may decide to make further strategic investments in natural gas-fired facilities in the future by purchase, construction, or lease. 

Diesel Generators 

At September 30, 2016 , TVA had one diesel generator plant consisting of five &#32;units, and this facility accounted for 9 &#32;MW of summer net capability. 

Energy Efficiency, Demand Response, and Renewable Energy Programs 

During 2015, the TVA Board approved the 2015 Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP") &#32;as a guide in making decisions about the energy resources TVA may use to meet future demand for electricity in the Tennessee Valley. The purpose of integrated resource planning is to meet future power demand by identifying the need for generating capacity and determining the best mix of resources to meet the need on a least-cost, system-wide basis. The 2015 IRP affirms the merits of a diverse portfolio including energy efficiency/demand response and renewable energy. Changes to TVA load forecasts and the recognition of the increasing penetration of generation and energy management technologies require an awareness of the evolving role of energy efficiency, demand response, and renewable generation. These resources, together with other options that are typically connected to the distribution systems of the LPCs, represent a new component in the utility marketplace called distributed energy resources ("DER") . Because of its unique business model, TVA will engage LPCs as it considers new and innovative ways to ensure that evolving resource portfolios remain reliable and provide the most value to all customers. 

Energy Efficiency/Demand Response. &#32; &#32;The IRP considered a broad range of feasible supply-side and demand-side options and assessed them with respect to financial, economic, and environmental impacts. Energy efficiency was modeled as a selectable, supply-side equivalent resource. Implementing energy efficiency programs will require close cooperation among TVA, local stakeholders, LPCs, and electric customers, particularly around deployment of additional energy efficiency resources. The success of energy efficiency depends on end-use customer participation. Generation or purchased power avoided by efficiency standards, TVA&#8217;s EE programs, and individual customer actions accounted for six percent of TVA&#8217;s 2016 and five percent of TVA&#8217;s 2015 resource mix. 

TVA is primarily a wholesale power provider. Because the LPCs are the service provider for most end-use customers, TVA will need to work with LPCs and others in the region to design additional delivery mechanisms to achieve the levels of penetration required to optimize the implementation of DER. 

TVA, in cooperation with its customers, continues to implement a broad portfolio of energy efficiency, demand response, and system load enhancement programs and projects designed to help reduce long-term energy supply costs in the TVA service area through EnergyRight&#174; Solutions ("ERS") &#32;programs. Through these programs, TVA realized 381 gigawatt hours ("GWh") &#32;and 412 GWh of energy efficiency savings in 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. 

ERS programs continue to be modified with the implementation of the eScore program, which includes a wireless data collection system to more effectively document and process residential evaluation data. TVA launched the eScore design throughout the Tennessee Valley in December 2014 with greater focus on establishing a long-term efficiency improvement relationship with participating homeowners and has completed nearly 35,000 homes through September 30, 2016 . &#32; The ERS programs also include demand reduction efforts such as dispatchable voltage regulation which contribute to TVA's management of peak loads. 

Renewable Energy Programs. &#32;TVA's Green Power Switch &#174; &#32; ("GPS") &#32;program is a voluntary program that supports the production of renewable energy by allowing consumers to purchase such energy either through the LPCs or from TVA for directly served &#32; customers. Supply for the retail portion of the program is sourced from within the TVA service area and sold in 150 kWh blocks. In addition to the standard retail program, TVA continues to test a lower-priced bulk option under GPS that allows for larger commercial and industrial customers located within certain portions of TVA's service area to purchase REC products. A REC is an environmental commodity that represents the environmental attributes of one MWh of renewable energy. Supply for the bulk option is sourced from TVA-contracted renewable energy within the greater Southeastern region. TVA also tested a 100-percent solar option for retail customers, which ended in July 2015. In total, consumers participating in GPS purchased the equivalent of 202,158 MWh of renewable energy in CY 2015. Renewable capacities are stated in terms of direct current (&#8220;DC&#8221;) nameplate ratings. 

In 2013, TVA replaced its Generation Partners ("GP") &#32;program with the Green Power Providers ("GPP") program for the purpose of encouraging the development of small-scale solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric generation systems across the Tennessee Valley that are 50 kW or less. The GPP program was not fully subscribed for CY 2015. As of September 30, 2016 , the combined participation for the GP and GPP programs comprised more than 100 MW of operating generation with 4.16 MW of additional approved capacity in the GPP program that has yet to become operational. 

&#160; 

The Renewable Standard Offer ("RSO") &#32;program is a voluntary program that began in 2011 to increase the amount of renewable energy generated in TVA's service territory. This program offers pre-set prices, terms, and conditions for power generated by selected, commercially available renewable energy technologies. Solar, wind, and specific biomass projects are included in the program. Projects must be greater than 50 kW, but no greater than 20 MW, in nameplate capacity. TVA demonstrated its continued commitment to renewable energy by offering to purchase an additional 100 MW under the RSO program in CY 2015. As of September 30, 2016 , TVA had over 79 MW of operating generation and an additional 120.5 MW under application or contract not yet operating. The RSO offering was sunset in 2015, but the program remains open to projects that have existing capacity allocations and are in the process of being completed. The utility-scale renewable energy sector has matured in recent years and is becoming more competitive with traditional energy resources. Accordingly, starting in 2016, utility-scale renewable energy projects are no longer limited by programmatic caps but are competitively evaluated alongside other generation sources. 

In an effort to continue to evaluate the value of small to medium scale renewable projects, TVA extended the Solar Solution Initiative ("SSI") . SSI was a targeted incentive program that aimed to support the existing local solar industry while also serving as a recruitment tool for new industry in the Tennessee Valley region by retaining and adding investment and jobs. The program provided incentive payments for mid-sized (greater than 50 kW up to 1 MW) solar projects in TVA's RSO program if the projects used local certified installers in the Tennessee Valley region. At the beginning of 2016, SSI transitioned to the Distributed Solar Solutions ("DSS") &#32;pilot. DSS is designed to encourage renewable energy projects that are directed by TVA&#8217;s LPCs. Projects can range in size from greater than 50 kW up to 5 MW of solar electric energy. For the CY 2016 program year, TVA awarded 16.7 MW of renewable solar capacity to seven different projects in four LPC territories. 

New energy management systems and energy storage technologies present opportunities for more sophisticated and integrated operation of the entire grid. The advent of electric vehicles and small-scale renewable generation has hastened the development of battery technologies that have the potential to mitigate the intermittent supply issues associated with many renewable generation options. Implementation of the technologies in conjunction with two-way communication to the site creates the potential for better management of other distributed energy resources on the grid. 

Onsite energy management technologies and the proliferation of companies interested in providing services to support and aggregate the impacts of such systems provide another DER avenue. Such systems can afford the consumer benefits through reduced consumption, increased comfort, detailed energy use data, and savings from time-sensitive rate structures. TVA and LPCs must consider the integration of the impacts from changes in usage patterns generated by the application of such systems. 

Demand response systems that take advantage of the increasing communications sophistication to homes, businesses, and distribution system assets also afford the opportunity for more granular control of system demand. Technologies can manage individual customer systems to shift usage from peak to off-peak periods and create significant reductions in the need for peak generation output. More sophisticated distribution control systems can also lower peak demand through control of excess voltage on the system on either a dispatchable or continuous basis. 

TVA is leading an initiative with the goal of determining the value of distributed resources for its system. Initial efforts are focused on small-scale distributed (rooftop) solar, but the method is general enough to allow for value determination for other distributed options. Work is ongoing, led by a team that includes technical support from the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI") , to develop a methodology to identify site preferences on the distribution systems of the LPCs. This work, along with locational analysis already completed by TVA, will help in placing utility-scale solar in furtherance of the IRP recommendations as well as distributed solar to meet the needs of LPCs. See Research and Development. 

Purchased Power and Other Agreements 

TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers through long-term and short-term power purchase agreements as well as through power spot market purchases. During 2016 , TVA acquired approximately eight percent of the power that it purchased on the power spot market, approximately one percent through short-term power purchase agreements, and approximately 91 percent through the long-term power purchase agreements, including the long-term renewable generation resources, described below. 

&#160; 

A portion of TVA&#8217;s capability provided by power purchase agreements is provided under contracts that expire between 2023 and 2038 , and the most significant of these contracts are described in the table below. TVA has executed contracts with two solar facilities that are under development. One, located in northwest Alabama, is expected to begin commercial operation during the first quarter of 2017, and the other, located in western Tennessee, is expected to begin commercial operation during the fourth quarter of 2018. TVA, along with others, contract with the Southeastern Power Administration ("SEPA") &#32;to obtain power and energy from nine &#32;USACE hydroelectric facilities on the Cumberland River system. The agreement with SEPA can be terminated upon three &#32;years&#8217; notice, but this termination may not become effective prior to June 30, 2017. The contract requires SEPA to provide TVA an annual minimum number of hours of energy for each megawatt of TVA&#8217;s capacity allocation, and all surplus energy from the hydroelectric facilities on the Cumberland River system. These contracts have been included in the table below.

(1) Power delivery is expected to commence in November 2016. 

(2) Power delivery is expected to commence in July 2018. 

(3) TVA&#8217;s contract with SEPA is for 405 MW of capacity; however, at September 30, 2016 TVA&#8217;s capacity under the contract was 347 MW because of repairs being completed at certain of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer facilities marketed by SEPA. TVA expects this period of reduced capacity to be in effect until 2019. 

&#160; 

&#32;Under federal law, TVA is required to purchase energy from qualifying cogenerators and small power producers at TVA's avoided cost of self-generating or purchasing this energy from another source. TVA fulfills this requirement through the Dispersed Power Production Program. As of September 30, 2016 , there were 25 generation sources, with a combined qualifying capacity of 259 &#32;MW, whose power TVA purchases under this law. 

As of September 30, 2016 , TVA was a party to &#32; contracts with eight wind farms for the purchase of energy. TVA's most significant wind contracts are described in the table below.

In addition, TVA has contracted for 27 MW of nameplate renewable energy capacity from 15 wind turbine generators located on Buffalo Mountain near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 4.8 MW of nameplate capacity from a landfill gas facility near Knoxville, Tennessee, and 4.5 MW of nameplate capacity from a solar farm in Haywood County, Tennessee. 

Fuel Supply 

General 

TVA&#8217;s consumption of various types of fuel depends largely on the demand for electricity by TVA&#8217;s customers, the availability of various generating units, and the availability and cost of fuel. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Financial Results &#32;&#8212; Operating Expenses. 

&#160; 

Coal 

Coal consumption at TVA&#8217;s coal-fired generating facilities during 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was approximately 24 million tons and 28 million tons, respectively. At September 30, 2016 , and September 30, 2015 , TVA had 31 days and 32 days of system-wide coal supply at full burn rate, respectively, with net book values of $252 million and $316 million, respectively. 

TVA utilizes both short-term and long-term (longer than one year) coal contracts. During 2016 , long-term contracts made up 97 percent of coal purchases and short-term contracts accounted for the remaining three percent. TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths, terms, and coal quality to meet its expected consumption and inventory requirements. During 2016 &#32;and 2015 , TVA purchased coal by basin as follows: 

The following charts present the proportion of each delivery method TVA utilizes for its coal supply for the periods indicated: 

Generally, total system coal inventories were at or above target levels for the first half of 2016 due to lower than planned coal-fired generation requirements. However, due to higher temperatures, lower rainfall, and less hydroelectric generation, inventories at some facilities fell below target levels during 2016 as TVA increased the amount of coal used to meet generation needs. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas and Fuel Oil 

During 2016 , TVA purchased a significant amount of its natural gas requirements from a variety of suppliers under contracts with terms of up to three years and purchased substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market. See Note 14 &#32;&#8212; Derivatives Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment &#32;&#8212; Derivatives Under FTP . The net book value of TVA&#8217;s natural gas inventory was $7 million and $8 million at September 30, 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. The net book value of TVA&#8217;s fuel oil inventory was $86 million and $90 million at September 30, 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. At September 30, 2016 , 80 of the combustion turbines that TVA operates were dual-fuel capable, and TVA has fuel oil stored on each of these sites for its dual-fuel combustion turbines as a backup to natural gas. 

TVA purchases natural gas from multiple suppliers on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual basis. During 2016, daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual contracts accounted for 54 percent, eight percent, 25 percent and 13 percent of purchases, respectively. TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet. During 2016, TVA transported natural gas on eight separate pipelines, with approximately 40 percent being transported on a single pipeline. During 2016, TVA maintained a total of approximately 988,500 MMBtu/Day of firm transportation capacity on seven major pipelines, with approximately 42 percent of total firm transportation capacity being maintained on a single pipeline. 

&#160; 

TVA utilizes natural gas storage services at four facilities with a total capacity of 4.58 Bcf of firm service and 0.30 Bcf of interruptible service to manage the daily balancing requirements of the eight pipelines used by TVA, with approximately 41 percent of the total storage capacity being maintained at a single facility. During 2016, storage levels were generally maintained at between 40 and 80 percent of the maximum contracted capacity at each facility. As TVA&#8217;s natural gas requirements grow, it is anticipated that additional storage capacity will be acquired to meet the needs of the generating assets as well as their operating requirements. In 2017, TVA expects to add a minimum of 1.50 Bcf of firm capacity to its storage portfolio. 

Nuclear Fuel 

Current Fuel Supply . Converting uranium to nuclear fuel generally involves four stages: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas; the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into fuel assemblies. For its forward four-year (2017-2020) requirements, TVA currently has 100 percent of its uranium mining and milling, conversion services, enrichment services, and fabrication services requirements either in inventory or under contract. TVA anticipates being able to fill its needs beyond this period by normal contracting processes as market forecasts indicate that the fuel cycle components will be readily available. In 2016, TVA obtained the fuel assemblies loaded into its nuclear power plants from two fabricators. 

TVA, DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements providing for surplus DOE highly enriched uranium (uranium that is too highly enriched for use in a nuclear power plant) to be blended with other uranium. The enriched uranium that results from this blending process, which is called blended low-enriched uranium ("BLEU") , is fabricated into fuel that can be used in a nuclear power plant. This blended nuclear fuel was first loaded in a Browns Ferry reactor in 2005 and is expected to continue to be used to reload the Browns Ferry reactors through at least 2017. BLEU fuel was loaded into Sequoyah Unit 2 three times but is not expected to be used in the Sequoyah reactors in the future. 

Under the terms of an interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, in exchange for supplying highly enriched uranium materials for processing into usable BLEU fuel for TVA, the DOE participates in the savings generated by TVA&#8217;s use of this blended nuclear fuel. See Note 1 &#32;&#8212; Blended Low-Enriched Uranium Program &#32;for a more detailed discussion of the BLEU project. 

Mixed Oxide Nuclear Fuel. Under the DOE Surplus Plutonium Disposition ("SPD") &#32;Program, mixed oxide ("MOX") &#32;fuel would be fabricated with surplus plutonium and depleted uranium as a replacement for commercial uranium fuel. In February 2010, the DOE and TVA entered into an interagency agreement to evaluate the potential use of MOX fuel in reactors at Browns Ferry and Sequoyah. As part of the evaluation of MOX fuel, TVA participated as a cooperating agency in the DOE's development of the April 2015 final supplemental environmental impact statement ("EIS") &#32;that addresses the potential use of MOX fuel in the TVA reactors. A decision to use MOX fuel is not required or expected for several years. At the earliest, based on the expected production rate of MOX fuel, TVA could start using a small number of MOX fuel assemblies in TVA reactors after 2020. TVA's three criteria for implementing MOX fuel are that it must be environmentally and operationally safe; it must be economical compared to other nuclear fuel used by TVA; and it must be licensed by the NRC for use. If TVA decides to use MOX fuel and the NRC approves its use, some changes in the operation of the reactors are expected and additional equipment may be required. As TVA continues to evaluate fuel options, current fuel supply plans do not include MOX fuel. 

Low-Level Radioactive Waste. Low-level radioactive waste ("radwaste") &#32;results from certain materials and supplies used in the normal operation of nuclear electrical generation units. TVA sends shipments of radwaste to burial facilities in Clive, Utah and Andrews, Texas. TVA is capable of storing some radwaste at its own facilities for an extended period of time, if necessary. 

&#160; 

Spent Nuclear Fuel. The Sequoyah dry cask storage facilities have been in use since 2004 and are expected to provide storage capacity through 2026. The Browns Ferry dry cask storage facilities have been in use since 2005. Completed and planned expansion to Browns Ferry independent spent fuel storage installation facilities, including implementation of larger storage casks, is expected to extend storage capacity from 2016 to 2030. TVA began loading used fuel into the new larger casks at Browns Ferry and Sequoyah in 2015. Watts Bar has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pool through CY 2016. During 2016, TVA completed the construction of an independent spent fuel installation pad for spent fuel storage at Watts Bar, and cask loading began in September 2016. To recover the cost of providing long-term, on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel, TVA filed a breach of contract suit against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims in 2001. As a result of this lawsuit and related agreements, TVA has collected approximately $172 million through 2016 . 

Tritium-Related Services. TVA and the DOE are engaged in a long-term interagency agreement under which TVA will, at the DOE&#8217;s request, irradiate tritium producing burnable absorber rods to assist the DOE in producing tritium for the Department of Defense ("DOD") . This agreement, which ends in 2035, requires the DOE to reimburse TVA for the costs that TVA incurs in connection with providing irradiation services and to pay TVA an irradiation services fee at a specified rate per tritium-producing rod over the period when irradiation occurs. 

&#32;In general, tritium-producing rods are irradiated for one operating cycle, which lasts about 18 months. At the end of the cycle, TVA removes the irradiated rods and loads them into a shipping cask. The DOE then ships them to its tritium-extraction facility. TVA loads a fresh set of tritium-producing rods into the reactor during each refueling outage. Irradiating the tritium-producing rods does not affect TVA&#8217;s ability to safely operate the reactors to produce electricity. 

TVA has provided irradiation services using only Watts Bar Unit 1 since 2003. Although the interagency agreement provides for irradiation services to be performed at Watts Bar and Sequoyah, TVA expects the Watts Bar site to provide sufficient capacity to fulfill this agreement. In December 2015, the DOE notified TVA of future increased needs for tritium requiring the use of a second reactor. TVA was a cooperating agency in the February 2016 DOE Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Production of Tritium in a Commercial Light Water Reactor, in which DOE&#8217;s preferred alternative included use of an additional reactor. TVA is assessing the potential for tritium production in Watts Bar Unit 2 to meet the DOE&#8217;s future tritium needs. 

Transmission 

The TVA transmission system is one of the largest in North America. TVA&#8217;s transmission system has 71 interconnections with 12 neighboring electric systems, and delivered nearly 159 billion kWh of electricity to TVA customers in 2016 . In carrying out its responsibility for transmission grid reliability in the TVA service area, TVA has operated with 99.999 percent reliability over the last 17 years in delivering electricity to customers. See Item 2, Properties &#8212; Transmission Properties . 

To the extent that federal law requires access to the TVA transmission system, TVA offers transmission services to others to transmit wholesale power in a manner that is comparable to TVA's own use of the transmission system. TVA has also adopted and operates in accordance with its published transmission Standards of Conduct and separates its transmission functions from its marketing functions. 

TVA is subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") &#32;and approved by FERC. These standards are designed to maintain the reliability of the bulk electric system, including TVA&#8217;s generation and transmission system, and include areas such as maintenance, training, operations, planning, modeling, critical infrastructure, physical and cyber security, vegetation management, and facility ratings. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations continue to become more complex and stringent for transmission systems. At present there are approximately 100 mandatory standards subject to enforcement containing approximately 1,200 requirements and sub-requirements that must be met. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Regulatory Compliance &#32;&#8212; Transmission Issues . 

Transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability when some coal-fired generating units are retired. TVA invested $362 million in such upgrades between 2011 and 2016, and estimates future expenditures for transmission upgrades required as a result of retired coal-fired units to be approximately $70 million for 2017 to 2020. Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. 

Weather and Seasonality 

Weather affects both the demand for and the market prices of electricity. TVA&#8217;s power system is generally a dual-peaking system in which the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which average temperatures in the five largest cities in TVA's service area vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Sales of Electricity. 

&#160; 

Rainfall in the Upper Basin of the Tennessee Valley was 103 percent of normal for 2016 &#32;and 106 percent of normal in 2015 . Also, runoff was 104 percent of normal in 2016 &#32;and 93 percent of normal in 2015 . Runoff is the amount of rainfall that is not absorbed by vegetation or the ground and actually reaches the rivers and reservoirs that TVA manages. TVA&#8217;s conventional hydroelectric generation decreased eight percent in 2016 &#32;as compared to 2015 , and increased six percent in 2015 &#32;as compared to 2014 . Conventional hydroelectric generation was approximately 93 percent of normal in 2016 &#32;and 101 percent of normal in 2015 . 

Competition 

TVA provides electricity in a service area that is largely free of competition from other electric power providers. This service area is defined primarily by two provisions of law: the fence and the anti-cherry-picking provision. The fence limits the region in which TVA or LPCs which distribute TVA power may provide power. The anti-cherry-picking provision limits the ability of others to use the TVA transmission system for the purpose of serving customers within TVA&#8217;s service area. However, other utilities may use their own transmission lines to serve customers within TVA's service area, underscoring the need for TVA to strategically price its products and services and design rates to be competitive. There have also been some efforts in the past to erode the protection of the anti-cherry-picking provision, and the protection of the anti-cherry-picking provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by congressional legislation at some time in the future. 

TVA also faces competition in the form of emerging technologies. Improvements in energy efficiency technologies, growing smart technologies, and energy storage technologies may reduce the demand for centrally provided power. The growing interest by customers to generate their own power through distributed generation (including solar power) has the potential to lead to a reduction in the load served by TVA as well as cause TVA to re-evaluate how it operates the overall grid system to continue to provide highly reliable power at affordable rates. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Distributed Energy Resources. 

Finally, TVA and other utility companies are facing an evolving marketplace of increased competition driven by customer choice and behavior. As technology develops, consumers' demands for the ability to access multiple products and customize services may increase, creating opportunities for growth with new products and services resulting from emerging technologies. 

Research and Development 

TVA makes annual investments in science and technological innovation to help meet future business and operational challenges. Each year, TVA&#8217;s annual research portfolio is updated based on a broad range of operational and industry drivers that help assess key technology gaps, performance issues, or other significant issues that should be addressed through research and development. Core research activities directly support optimization of TVA's generation and transmission assets, air and water quality, energy utilization, and distributed/clean energy integration. 

In the area of energy utilization, TVA evaluates emerging energy efficiency and load management technologies for market and program readiness. TVA's efforts are directed towards demonstrating and validating the performance, reliability, and consumer acceptance of new efficiency technology as well as the value of energy efficiency and load management technologies for the consumer, the LPCs, and TVA. Current initiatives include: 

&#8226; 

Smart Houses &#8212; test houses built to evaluate residential building techniques, energy efficiency, demand response technologies, and consumer smart grid concepts in a controlled, simulated occupancy research environment; 

&#8226; 

Hyperefficient HVAC &#8212; nationwide utility collaboration evaluating six technologies for residential and commercial applications, including ductless heat pumps and air conditioners, variable capacity air conditioning, LED street and area lighting, and efficient data centers for the commercial sector; 

&#8226; 

Grid-Empowered Consumers &#8212; comparative field test to evaluate the energy and demand savings potential of grid-enabled residential appliances in 20 test homes; and 

&#8226; 

Electric Vehicle Readiness &#8212; coordination of activities with EPRI and industry stakeholders related to transportation electrification to support operational fleet requirements and the needs of LPCs to provide guidance on matters of plug-in electric vehicle grid integration and readiness for transportation electrification technologies. 

Another area of focus for TVA is electric transportation and the continuing advancement of battery technology, infrastructure, and charging stations. Research in this area includes compatibility of charging stations to work efficiently with various types of electric vehicles, impact of charging stations on the power grid, refinement of power-system control processes to maximize energy efficiency, and development of smart charging strategies to maximize the potential of electricity to replace petroleum as the fuel of choice. 

TVA and its LPCs are developing research technologies with the potential to advance an intelligent transmission system. Smart meter technology has the potential to shift usage patterns away from peak demand times which could change 

&#160; 

costs significantly. Additionally, an intelligent transmission system would give TVA the ability to nearly instantaneously diagnose problems, make corrections, and engage transmission and generation resources quickly so that power would keep flowing. This could promote reduced emissions, lower energy costs, and add greater flexibility to accommodate the new consumer-generated sources under TVA&#8217;s renewable energy programs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources &#8212; Energy Efficiency, Demand Response, and Renewable Energy Programs. 

&#32;Finally, TVA is evaluating smaller, clean power sources that can be aggregated to provide power necessary to meet regular demand. Research efforts into these clean DER &#32;seek to understand the scope and impact of DER on operations and business economics and to develop strategies for adapting to the evolving electricity landscape in the Tennessee Valley. Of particular interest is modeling existing and expected solar power deployments in the Tennessee Valley to evaluate the full extent of system impacts of those renewable resources. Initial economic analyses have been conducted to identify the value of DER (particularly photovoltaic solar generation) to both TVA and the LPC system. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; &#32; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#8212; &#32; Distributed Energy Resources . 

Investments in TVA&#8217;s research portfolio are supported through partnership and collaboration with LPCs, EPRI and other research consortiums, the DOE and other federal agencies, national labs, peer utilities, universities, and industry vendors and participation in professional societies. 

Flood Control Activities 

The Tennessee River watershed has one of the highest annual rainfall totals of any watershed in the United States, averaging 51 inches per year. During 2016 , approximately 55 inches of rain fell in the Tennessee Valley. TVA manages the Tennessee River system in an integrated manner, balancing hydroelectric generation with navigation, flood damage reduction, water quality and supply, and recreation. TVA spills or releases excess water through the tributary and main stem dams in order to reduce flood damage to the Tennessee Valley. TVA typically spills only when all available hydroelectric generating turbines are operating at full capacity and additional water still needs to be moved downstream. 

&#160; 

Environmental Stewardship Activities 

TVA&#8217;s mission includes managing the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and federal lands along the shoreline to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, affordable and reliable electricity, and, consistent with these primary purposes, recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, and natural resource protection. There are 49 dams that comprise TVA&#8217;s integrated reservoir system. Each dam may also have ancillary structures used to support or assist the main dam's function. The reservoir system provides approximately 800 miles of commercially navigable waterways and also provides significant flood reduction benefits both within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The reservoir system also provides a water supply for residential and industrial customers, as well as cooling water for TVA&#8217;s coal-fired plants, combined cycle plants, and nuclear power plants. TVA&#8217;s Environmental Policy, which was adopted by the TVA Board in 2008, provides objectives for an integrated approach related to providing cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy, supporting sustainable economic growth, and engaging in proactive environmental stewardship. The Environmental Policy provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas, including water resource protection and improvements, sustainable land use, and natural resource management. 

TVA serves the people of the TVA region through the integrated management of the Tennessee River system and public lands, which includes approximately 11,000 miles of shoreline, 650,000 surface acres of reservoir water, and 293,000 acres of reservoir lands. TVA accomplishes this mission and supports the objectives of the TVA Environmental Policy through implementation of its Natural Resources Stewardship strategy. Within this strategy, TVA confirms a desire to remain agile, balance competing demands, and be a catalyst for collaboration in order to protect and enhance biological, cultural, and water resources as well as create and sustain destinations for recreation and opportunities for learning and research. As part of the strategy, TVA will also assist water-based community development with technical support, land agreements, and permitting using planning, clear regulations, meaningful guidelines, and consistent enforcement. Additional guidance for carrying out many of TVA's essential stewardship responsibilities is provided in TVA's Natural Resource Plan. The Natural Resource Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed. 

Economic Development Activities 

Since its creation in 1933, TVA has promoted the development of the Tennessee Valley. Economic development, along with energy production and environmental stewardship, is one of the purposes of TVA. TVA works with its LPCs, regional, state, and local agencies, and communities to showcase the advantages available to businesses locating or expanding in TVA's service area. TVA's primary economic development goals are to recruit companies to locate in the Tennessee Valley, encourage expansion of existing business and industry that provide quality jobs, and assist communities in the Tennessee Valley with economic growth opportunities. TVA seeks to meet these goals through a combination of initiatives and partnerships designed to provide financial assistance, technical services, industry expertise, and site-selection assistance to new and existing businesses. 

&#160; 

Economic development programs developed by TVA include those which focus on supporting all communities including rural and economically distressed communities across the Tennessee Valley by working in close partnership with other federal and state organizations. TVA also jointly offers incentive programs with participating LPCs. These programs offer competitive incentives to existing and potential power customers in certain business sectors that make multi-year commitments to invest in the Tennessee Valley. In addition to financial support for these programs, TVA offers resources to communities and economic developers in the areas of recruitment, leadership development, industrial product preparedness (sites and buildings), planning, and project assistance. 

TVA's economic development efforts helped recruit or expand over 244 companies into the TVA service area during 2016 . These companies announced capital investments of over $8.3 billion and the expected creation and/or retention of over 72,100 jobs. 

Regulation 

Congress 

TVA exists pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress and carries on its operations in accordance with this legislation. Congress can enact legislation expanding or reducing TVA&#8217;s activities, change TVA&#8217;s structure, and even eliminate TVA. Congress can also enact legislation requiring the sale of some or all of the assets TVA operates or reduce the United States&#8217;s ownership in TVA. To allow TVA to operate more flexibly than a traditional government agency, Congress exempted TVA from all or parts of certain general federal laws that govern other agencies, such as federal labor relations laws and the laws related to the hiring of federal employees, the procurement of supplies and services, and the acquisition of land. Other federal laws enacted since the creation of TVA that are applicable to other agencies have been made applicable to TVA, including those related to paying employees overtime and protecting the environment, cultural resources, and civil rights. 

Securities and Exchange Commission 

Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") &#32;requires TVA to file with the SEC such periodic, current, and supplementary information, documents, and reports as would be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act if TVA were an issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Section 37 of the Exchange Act exempts TVA from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer&#8217;s audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer. Since TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the United States, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are &#8220;exempted securities&#8221; under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and may be offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act. In addition, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are &#8220;exempted securities&#8221; and &#8220;government securities&#8221; under the Exchange Act. TVA is also exempt from Sections 14(a)-(d) and 14(f)-(h) of the Exchange Act (which address proxy solicitations) insofar as those sections relate to securities issued by TVA, and transactions in TVA securities are exempt from rules governing tender offers under Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act. Also, since TVA securities are exempted securities under the Securities Act, TVA is exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 insofar as it relates to securities issued by TVA, and no independent trustee is required for these securities. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

Under the FPA, TVA is not a &#8220;public utility,&#8221; a term which primarily refers to investor-owned utilities. Therefore, TVA is not subject to the full jurisdiction that FERC exercises over public utilities under the FPA. TVA is, however, an &#8220;electric utility&#8221; and a &#8220;transmitting utility&#8221; as defined in the FPA and, thus, is directly subject to certain aspects of FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction. 

Under Section 215 of the FPA, TVA must comply with certain standards designed to maintain transmission system reliability. These standards are approved by FERC and enforced by NERC. 

Under Section 210 of the FPA, TVA can be ordered to interconnect its transmission facilities with the electrical facilities of qualified generators and other electric utilities that meet certain requirements. It must be found that the requested interconnection is in the public interest and would encourage conservation of energy or capital, optimize efficiency of facilities or resources, or improve reliability. The requirements of Section 212 of the FPA concerning the terms and conditions of interconnection, including reimbursement of costs, must also be met. 

Under Section 211 of the FPA, TVA can be ordered to transmit wholesale power provided that the order (1) does not impair the reliability of the TVA or surrounding systems and (2) meets the applicable requirements of Section 212 concerning terms, conditions, and rates for service. Under Section 211A of the FPA, TVA is subject to FERC review of the transmission rates and the terms and conditions of service that TVA provides others to ensure comparability of treatment of such service with TVA&#8217;s own use of its transmission system and that the terms and conditions of service are not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The anti-cherrypicking provision of Section 212 of the FPA precludes TVA from being ordered to wheel another supplier&#8217;s power to a customer if the power would be consumed within TVA&#8217;s defined service territory. 

&#160; 

Sections 221 and 222 of the FPA, applicable to all market participants, including TVA, prohibit (1) reporting false information on the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity to a federal agency with intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled by the agency and (2) using manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of power or transmission services subject to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction. 

Section 206(e) of the FPA provides FERC with authority to order refunds of excessive prices on short-term sales (transactions lasting 31 days or less) by all market participants, including TVA, in price gouging situations if such sales are through an independent system operator or regional transmission organization under a FERC-approved tariff. 

Section 220 of the FPA provides FERC with authority to issue regulations requiring the reporting, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale power and transmission service by all market participants, including TVA. 

Under Sections 306 and 307 of the FPA, FERC may investigate electric industry practices, including TVA&#8217;s operations previously mentioned that are subject to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction. 

Under Sections 316 and 316A of the FPA, FERC has authority to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation on entities subject to the provisions of Part II of the FPA, which includes the above provisions applicable to TVA. Criminal penalties may also result from such violations. 

Finally, while not required to do so, TVA has elected to implement various FERC orders and regulations pertaining to public utilities on a voluntary basis to the extent that they are consistent with TVA&#8217;s obligations under the TVA Act. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission 

TVA operates its nuclear facilities in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the oversight of the NRC, an independent federal agency which sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow. The NRC has broad authority to impose requirements relating to the licensing, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities. In addition, if TVA fails to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA&#8217;s operating licenses. 

Environmental Protection Agency 

TVA is subject to regulation by the EPA in a variety of areas, including air quality control, water quality control, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. See Environmental Matters below . 

States 

The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states, without congressional consent, from regulating the manner in which the federal government conducts its activities. As a federal agency, TVA is exempt from regulation, control, and taxation by states except in certain areas where Congress has clearly made TVA subject to state regulation. See Environmental Matters below. 

Other Federal Entities 

TVA&#8217;s activities and records are also subject to review to varying degrees by other federal entities, including the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") . There is also an Office of the Inspector General which reviews TVA&#8217;s activities and records. 

Taxation and Tax Equivalents 

TVA is not subject to federal income taxation. In addition, neither TVA nor its property, franchises, or income is subject to taxation by states or their subdivisions. Section 13 of the TVA Act does, however, require TVA to make tax equivalent payments to states and counties in which TVA conducts power operations or in which TVA has acquired properties previously subject to state and local taxation. The total amount of these payments is five percent of gross revenues from the sale of power during the preceding year excluding sales or deliveries to other federal agencies and off-system sales with other utilities, with a provision for minimum payments under certain circumstances. Except for certain direct payments TVA is required to make to counties, distribution of tax equivalent payments within a state is determined by individual state legislation. 

Environmental Matters 

TVA&#8217;s activities, particularly its power generation activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws and regulations relating to air pollution, water pollution, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other issues. Climate change and clean energy continue to be areas of focus relative to 

&#160; 

environmental regulation. TVA has been proactive in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions through a decreased reliance on coal-fired plants and an increased reliance on clean and renewable energy. 

Clean Air Act 

The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation&#8217;s air quality and control sources of air pollution. The major CAA programs that affect TVA&#8217;s power generation activities are described below. 

National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") &#32;for certain air pollutants. The EPA has done this for ozone, particulate matter ("PM") , sulfur dioxide &#32;("SO 2 "), nitrogen dioxide ("NO 2 "), carbon monoxide, and lead. Over the years, the EPA has made the NAAQS more stringent. Each state must develop a plan to be approved by the EPA for achieving and maintaining NAAQS within its borders. These plans impose limits on emissions from pollution sources, including TVA fossil fuel-fired plants. Areas meeting a NAAQS are designated as attainment areas. Areas not meeting a NAAQS are designated as non-attainment areas, and more stringent requirements apply in those areas, including stricter controls on industrial facilities and more complicated permitting processes. TVA fossil fuel-fired plants can be impacted by these requirements. All TVA generating units either are located in areas designated as in attainment with the NAAQS, or are in areas where air quality meets the NAAQS and designation to attainment is expected soon. As of September 30, 2016 , Knoxville was the only area in the Tennessee Valley region that was designated as non-attainment for fine PM NAAQS. TVA expects the EPA to designate the Knoxville area as attainment for fine PM NAAQS in the near future. However, as NAAQS become more stringent, utilities are expected to come under increasing pressure to further reduce emissions from their existing fossil fuel generating plants. 

Currently, all areas of the Tennessee Valley meet the 2008 ozone NAAQS. On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to revise the ozone NAAQS to 70 parts per billion ("ppb") &#32;from the 2008 standard of 75 ppb. The EPA is expected to make final designations in 2017. The Tennessee Valley has been showing improvements in regional air quality; however, the impacts of the 2015 ozone NAAQS on TVA and states in TVA's service territory are not possible to determine until the EPA makes designations in 2017 with respect to the 2015 ozone standard. 

On March 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California approved a consent decree between the EPA and certain environmental petitioners in Sierra Club v. McCarthy . The consent decree set a schedule for the EPA to complete nationwide area designations with respect to the 2010 1-Hour SO 2 &#32;NAAQS based on monitored air quality levels and SO 2 &#32;source emission rates and amounts. Air quality modeling was required in 2016 to determine designation of areas around five TVA coal-fired plants. No areas around any TVA generating units are expected to be designated non-attainment. Lower SO 2 &#32;permit limits well within the capability of existing control equipment are expected for TVA's Gallatin Fossil Plant ("Gallatin") &#32;and Paradise coal-fired units. 

Cross State Air Pollution Rule. The EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") &#32;in July 2011, requiring several states in the eastern United States to improve air quality relative to the 1997 ozone NAAQS and the 1997 and 2006 fine particle NAAQS by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to pollution in other states. CSAPR replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR") , a similar but less stringent rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") vacated the rule before implementation began, but the D.C. Circuit&#8217;s vacatur was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in April 2014. Upon further proceedings on remand, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA&#8217;s motion to restore CSAPR but delayed the compliance deadlines by three years. Under the revised compliance deadlines, Phase I emission reductions in SO 2 and NO X &#32;became effective on January 1, 2015, and will be followed by Phase II reductions that become effective on May 1, 2017. TVA&#8217;s significant prior reductions in SO 2 and NO X &#32;emissions and planned future reductions will aid in compliance with CSAPR. 

&#160; 

On September 7, 2016, the EPA issued an update to CSAPR to address cross-state pollution relative to the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and also to respond to a July 2015 remand of the CSAPR emission budgets for certain states by the D.C. Circuit. In this update, the EPA implemented more stringent the Phase II reductions for NO X &#32;that become effective on May 1, 2017. However, TVA does not currently anticipate significant changes to its operations based on the CSAPR update rule. 

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Electric Utility Units . In April 2012, the EPA promulgated a final rule establishing standards for hazardous air pollutants emitted from steam electric utilities. The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") &#32;rule requires additional controls for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, non-mercury metals, and acid gases, for some of TVA&#8217;s coal-fired units by April 15, 2015, while the compliance date for units granted a one-year extension under the CAA was April 15, 2016. TVA has chosen to idle or retire some units in lieu of investing in additional controls. 

The D.C. Circuit upheld the MATS rule on April 15, 2014. In June 2015, however, the United States Supreme Court remanded the rule, finding that the EPA was required to consider cost before deciding whether the regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted from steam electric utilities was appropriate and necessary. 

In April 2016, in response to the Supreme Court's remand, the EPA published the final Supplemental Finding That It is Appropriate and Necessary to Regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units. Several groups have filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit challenging the EPA&#8217;s determination. The MATS rule will remain in effect while these challenges are pending, and TVA&#8217;s MATS compliance strategy will thus not be affected by these challenges. 

&#160; 

In April 2016, in response to a request from TVA, the EPA issued an administrative order under the Clean Air Act to allow operation of Paradise Units 1 and 2 for a year beyond the MATS compliance date of April 15, 2016. The additional year will allow these units to continue to operate while the new combined cycle facility being built at the site becomes operational. TVA expects to retire Paradise Units 1 and 2 once this replacement capacity is available. 

The Environmental Agreements. See Note 20 &#32; &#8212; &#32; Legal Proceedings &#32; &#8212; &#32; Environmental Agreements for a discussion of the Environmental Agreements, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 

Acid Rain Program. Congress established the Acid Rain Program to achieve reductions in emissions of SO 2 &#32;and NO x , the primary pollutants implicated in the formation of acid rain. The program includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO 2 &#32;emissions from power plants. TVA continues to reduce SO 2 and NO X &#32;emissions from its coal-fired plants, and the SO 2 &#32;allowances allocated to TVA under the Acid Rain Program are sufficient to cover the operation of its coal-fired plants. In the TVA service area, the limitations imposed on NO x &#32;emissions by either the CAIR or CSAPR program are more stringent than the Acid Rain Program. Therefore, TVA forecasts that the Acid Rain Program will have no impact on TVA other than administrative reporting. 

Regional Haze Program . In June 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, amending its CY 1999 regional haze rule, which had established time lines for states to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States with a target of reaching no anthropogenic impacts on visibility in these areas by 2064. One requirement under the amended rule is that certain types of older existing sources are required to install best available retrofit technology. No additional controls or lower operating limits are required for any TVA units to meet best available retrofit technology requirements. On May 4, 2016, the EPA published the proposed rule "Protection of Visibility: Amendments to Requirements for State Plans." The proposed rule would change some of the requirements for Regional Haze State Implementation Plans ("Regional Haze SIPs") . TVA does not expect significant impacts to its operations from these changes, but specific impacts are not possible to predict until the rule is final and future Regional Haze SIPs are submitted to the EPA and approved. 

Opacity. Opacity, or visible emissions, measures the denseness (or color) of power plant plumes and has traditionally been used by states as a means of monitoring good maintenance and operation of particulate control equipment. Under some conditions, retrofitting a unit with additional equipment to better control SO 2 &#32;and NO x &#32;emissions can adversely affect opacity performance, and TVA and other utilities are addressing this issue. The evaluation of utilities' compliance with opacity requirements is coming under increased scrutiny, especially during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. State implementation plans developed under the CAA typically exclude periods of startup, shutdowns, and malfunctions, but on June 12, 2015, the EPA finalized a rule to eliminate such exclusions. The EPA rule required states to modify their implementation plans by November 12, 2016. These new requirements could reduce flexibility and increase operational costs for TVA&#8217;s coal-fired plants. 

Petition to Expand the Ozone Transport Region. On December 9, 2013, eight of the twelve states that make up the Ozone Transport Region ("OTR") &#32;submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that nine states, including Kentucky and Tennessee, be added to the OTR. The EPA has 180 days under the CAA to act on such a petition. On October 6, 2016, six of the eight states filing the petition sued the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, asking the court to require the EPA to act on the petition by a date certain. TVA is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation at this time. Should the petition ultimately be granted, additional NO x &#32;reductions may be required from electric generating units and other sources in the states added to the OTR. New and modified sources in states added to the OTR would be required to have state of the art controls and meet other requirements as well. 

Climate Change 

Regulation . On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan, a rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants burning fossil fuels. The Clean Power Plan, which is part of President Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan strategy, establishes state-specific emission goals to lower CO 2 &#32;emissions from power plants, targeting a 32 percent nationwide reduction in CO 2 &#32;emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The EPA established an &#8220;interim goal&#8221; that states must meet on average over the eight-year period from 2022-2029 and a &#8220;final goal&#8221; that states must meet in 2030 and thereafter based on a two-year average. States were required to submit to the EPA final plans, or &#8220;initial plans&#8221; with a request for an extension, by September 6, 2016. States that received an extension are required to submit final plans by September 6, 2018. 

On February 9, 2016, the aforementioned requirements were suspended when the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan. The stay will remain in place while the D.C. Circuit reviews the rule and during any subsequent appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court that may occur after the D.C. Circuit issues its opinion. The stay means that the Clean Power Plan has no legal effect while courts are reviewing the rule to determine whether it is lawful. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan on September 27, 2016. 

On August 3, 2015, the EPA also finalized New Source Performance Standards for carbon emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. These standards apply to two types of fossil fuel-fired sources: (1) stationary 

&#160; 

combustion turbines, generally firing natural gas, and (2) electric utility steam generating units, generally firing coal. These standards reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction ("BSER") &#32;that the EPA has determined to be adequately demonstrated for each type of source. These standards will apply to the new combined-cycle plants that TVA is constructing at its Allen and Paradise facilities, and TVA believes that its current plans for those plants will enable it to comply with the new standards. 

Executive Actions. To strengthen the Administration's efforts to increase government-wide energy efficiency and sustainability and implement goals in the President&#8217;s June 2013 Climate Action Plan, President Obama issued a memorandum on December 5, 2013, requiring that at least 20 percent of the total amount of energy consumed by each federal agency in any fiscal year, starting in 2020, be renewable energy. TVA is on track to achieve the aforementioned 2020 goal of the Presidential Memorandum. In addition, on March 25, 2015, President Obama issued Executive Order 13693, which directed each federal agency to ensure that, starting in 2025 and continuing each year thereafter, no less than 30 percent of the total amount of building electric energy is renewable electric energy. TVA has submitted a climate adaptation plan as required by Executive Order 13693, and TVA is aligning the federal climate adaption plan with climate resiliency planning. The Executive Order also established a clean energy target for federal agencies to achieve 25 percent of total building energy from renewable plus thermal energy by 2025. 

On April 21, 2015, the Administration released the initial installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review ("QER") . In the QER, the Administration announced that the DOE is creating a partnership with 17 energy companies, including TVA, to improve infrastructure resilience against extreme weather and climate change. 

On August 1, 2016, the White House Council on Environmental Quality released final guidance to federal agencies on the consideration of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in reviews of their proposed actions conducted under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). This final guidance replaces two previous drafts and extends their scopes to include land and resource management actions. TVA does not anticipate significant changes to its NEPA procedures as a result of the final guidance. 

International Accords . On September 3, 2016, the United States formally ratified the Paris agreement. The agreement met the threshold of at least 55 countries that account for at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emission and formally entered into force on November 4, 2016. The durability of the Paris agreement commitments is uncertain. 

Litigation . In addition to legislative activity, climate change issues have been the subject of a number of lawsuits, including lawsuits against TVA. 

Indirect Consequences of Regulation or Business Trends . Legal, technological, political, and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities and risks. The potential indirect consequences could include an increase or decrease in electricity demand, increased demand for generation from alternative energy sources, and subsequent impacts to business reputation and public opinion. See &#32;Power Supply and Load Management Resources &#32;above . 

Physical Impacts of Climate Change. TVA manages the potential effects of climate change on its mission, programs, and operations within its environmental management processes. In June 2014, TVA issued an updated Statement on Climate Change Adaptation and annually updates its Climate Change Adaptation Plan. TVA's Climate Change Adaptation Plan was last updated in June 2016. 

Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions . TVA has reduced greenhouse gas ("GHG") &#32;emissions from both its generation stations and its operations. As discussed earlier in this Item 1, Business, recent TVA Board actions have focused on TVA&#8217;s plan to balance its coal-fired generation by increasing its nuclear capacity, modernizing its hydroelectric generation system, increasing natural gas-fired generation, installing emission control equipment on certain of its coal-fired units, increasing its purchases of renewable energy, and investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy use in the Tennessee Valley. Additionally, TVA has invested to reduce energy use in its operations. The combination of more stringent environmental regulations, lower natural gas prices, and lower demand for energy across the Tennessee Valley has reduced the utilization of coal-fired generation. These factors have resulted in lower CO 2 &#32;emissions from the TVA system. 

Renewable/Clean Energy Standards 

Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have established enforceable or mandatory requirements for electric utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources. One state within the TVA service area, North Carolina, has a mandatory renewable standard that, while not applying directly to TVA, does apply to TVA&#8217;s LPCs serving retail customers in that state. TVA's policy is to provide compliance assistance to any distributor of TVA power, and TVA is providing assistance to the four LPCs that sell TVA power in North Carolina. Likewise, the Mississippi Public Service Commission adopted an energy efficiency rule applying to electric and natural gas providers in the state, and TVA is supplying information on participation in ERS efforts to support the covered Mississippi LPCs. 

&#160; 

Water Quality Control Developments 

Cooling Water Intake Structures. &#32;&#32;On May 19, 2014, the EPA released a final rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, relating to cooling water intake structures ("CWIS") &#32;for existing power generating facilities. The rule requires changes in cooling water intake structures used to cool the vast majority of coal, gas, and nuclear steam-electric generating plants and a wide range of manufacturing and industrial facilities in the U.S. The final rule requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a cooling water intake structure. These new requirements will potentially affect a number of TVA&#8217;s fossil- and nuclear-fueled facilities and will likely require capital upgrades to ensure compliance. Most TVA facilities are projected to require retrofit of CWIS with &#8220;fish-friendly&#8221; screens and fish return systems to achieve compliance with the new rule. The rule will be implemented through permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") &#32;in Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. State agencies administer the NPDES permit program in most states including those in which TVA&#8217;s facilities are located. In addition, the responsible state agencies must provide all permit applications to the U.S. Fish &#38; Wildlife Service for a 60-day review prior to public notice and an opportunity to comment during the public notice. As a result, the permit may include requirements for additional studies of threatened and endangered species arising from U.S. Fish &#38; Wildlife Service comments and may require additional measures be taken to protect threatened and endangered species and critical habitats directly or indirectly related to the plant cooling water intake. TVA&#8217;s review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for cost-effective compliance. The required compliance timeframe is linked to plant specific NPDES permit renewal cycles (i.e., technology retrofits), and compliance is expected to be in the 2020-2022 timeframe. 

Hydrothermal Discharges. &#32;&#32;The EPA and many states continue to focus regulatory attention on potential effects of hydrothermal discharges. Many TVA plants have variances from thermal standards under Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act that are subject to review as NPDES permits are renewed. Specific data requirements in the future will be determined based on negotiations between TVA and regulators. If plant thermal limits are made more stringent, TVA may have to install cooling towers at some of its plants and operate installed cooling towers more often. This could result in a substantial cost to TVA. 

Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines . On November 3, 2015, the EPA published a final rule to revise the existing steam electric effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs") &#32;that updates the existing technology-based water discharge limitations for power plants nationwide. The new ELGs establish more stringent performance standards for existing and new sources that will require power plants that generate more than 50 MW to regulate discharges of toxic pollutants from seven primary wastewater streams. The primary impact for TVA is on the operation of existing and any potential new coal-fired generation facilities. The rule has the potential to impact long-term investment decisions being made relative to the long-term compliance and operability of TVA coal-fired units. Compliance with new requirements is required in the 2018-2023 timeframe and will necessitate major upgrades to wastewater treatment systems at all coal-fired plants. Dry fly ash handling is mandated by the rule. The rule also requires either dry bottom ash handling systems or &#8220;no discharge&#8221; recycle of bottom ash transport waters. In addition, new technology-based limits on flue gas desulfurization wastewater require primary physical/chemical treatment and secondary biological treatment to meet extremely low limits for arsenic, mercury, and selenium. 

With regard to its Cumberland Fossil Plant ("Cumberland") , TVA contends the ELG rulemaking did not appropriately consider available data that could affect these national limits as they applied at Cumberland given its unique &#8220;once-through&#8221; scrubber design. TVA is working with the State of Tennessee and the EPA in an effort to address this issue. Compliance with the rule at Cumberland without modification to address the unique design could cause TVA to incur disproportionately high costs at Cumberland or experience other operational outcomes which TVA cannot predict at this time. 

Other Clean Water Act Requirements . As is the case in other industrial sectors, TVA and other utilities are also facing more stringent requirements related to the protection of wetlands, reductions in storm water impacts from construction activities, new water quality criteria for nutrients and other pollutants, new wastewater analytical methods, and regulation of pesticide discharges. In addition, other new environmental regulations related to mining of coal in the Appalachian region under the Clean Water Act may increase the cost of coal that TVA purchases for its plants. 

Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes 

Liability for releases and cleanup of hazardous substances is imposed under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") , and other federal and parallel state statutes. In a manner similar to many other industries and power systems, TVA has generated or used hazardous substances over the years. 

TVA Sites. &#32;TVA operations at some of its facilities have resulted in contamination that TVA is addressing including at TVA's Environmental Research Center ("ERC") at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. At September 30, 2016 , TVA&#8217;s estimated liability for cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information is available to develop a cost estimate is approximately $23 million &#32;and is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the ERC has an active groundwater monitoring program as part of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") Corrective Action Permit. 

&#160; 

Non-TVA Sites. TVA is aware of alleged hazardous-substance releases at certain non-TVA areas for which it may have some liability. See Note 20 &#32;&#8212; Contingencies &#8212; Environmental Matters . 

Coal Combustion Residuals. &#32;&#32;The EPA published its final rule governing CCRs on April 17, 2015, and the rule became effective October 19, 2015. The rule regulates CCRs as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. While states may adopt the rule's requirements into their regulatory programs, the rule does not require states to adopt the requirements. Although the rule became effective October 19, 2015, certain provisions have later effective dates. TVA&#8217;s review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for compliance. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; &#32; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#8212; &#32;Generation Resources &#8212; &#32;Coal Combustion Residual Facilities &#32;for a discussion of the impact on TVA&#8217;s operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects. 

In August 2015, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") &#32;issued an order that (1) allowed TDEC to oversee TVA&#8217;s implementation of the EPA&#8217;s CCR rule and (2) required TVA to assess CCR contamination risks at seven of TVA&#8217;s eight coal-fired plants in Tennessee and to remediate any unacceptable risks. The TDEC order does not allege that TVA is violating any CCR regulatory requirements nor does it assess TVA penalties. The TDEC order sets out an iterative process through which TVA and TDEC will identify and evaluate any CCR contamination risks and, if necessary, respond to such risks. 

Groundwater Contamination . Environmental groups and state regulatory agencies are increasing their attention on groundwater contamination associated with coal combustion residuals ("CCRs") &#32;management activities. Seven of TVA&#8217;s 10 coal-fired plants are in some level of state regulatory groundwater assessment. Four of those plants (Colbert, Gallatin, Cumberland, and Shawnee) have investigations beyond monitoring and reporting. Five of the seven TVA coal-fired plants (Gallatin, Shawnee, Paradise, Johnsonville, and Widows Creek) have groundwater remediation monitoring with state regulatory involvement. As a result of these assessments and increased attention, TVA may have to change how it manages CCRs at some of its plants, potentially resulting in higher costs. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Initiatives and Challenges &#32;&#8212; Generation Resources &#32;&#8212; Coal Combustion Residual Facilities . 

Environmental Investments 

From the 1970's to 2016 , TVA spent approximately $6.5 billion on controls to reduce emissions from its coal-fired power plants. In addition, TVA has reduced emissions by idling or retiring coal-fired units and relying more on cleaner energy resources including natural gas and nuclear generation. 

SO 2 Emissions and NO x &#32;Emissions. &#32;To reduce SO 2 &#32;emissions, TVA operates scrubbers on 19 of its coal-fired units with scrubbers currently under construction on two additional units, and switched to lower-sulfur coal at 20 coal-fired units. To reduce NO x &#32;emissions, TVA operates SCRs on 18 coal-fired units with SCRs currently under construction on six additional units, operates selective non-catalytic reduction systems on four units, operates low-NO X &#32;burners or low-NO X &#32;combustion systems on 19 units, operates over-fire air on six cyclone units, optimized combustion on six units, and operates NO X &#32;control equipment year round when units are operating (except during start-up, shutdown, and maintenance periods). TVA has also retired or announced plans to retire 33 of 59 coal-fired units. Except for seven units at Shawnee, the remaining coal-fired units will either have scrubbers and SCRs or be retired. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources &#8212; Coal-Fired above . 

Particulate Emissions. To reduce particulate emissions of air pollutants, TVA has equipped all of its coal-fired units with scrubbers, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and/or bag houses. 

Primarily due to the actions described above, emissions of NO x &#32;have been reduced by 92 percent below peak 1995 levels and emissions of SO 2 &#32;have been reduced by 94 percent below 1977 levels through CY 2015. For CY 2015, TVA&#8217;s emission of CO 2 &#32;from its sources was approximately 70.1 million tons, a 34 percent reduction from 2005 levels. To remain consistent and provide clear information and to align with the EPA&#8217;s reporting requirements, TVA will continue to report CO 2 &#32;emissions on a CY basis. 

There could be additional material costs if further reductions of GHGs, including CO 2 , are mandated by legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions and if more stringent emission reduction requirements for conventional pollutants are established. These costs cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because of the uncertainty of these actions. A number of emerging EPA regulations establishing more stringent air, water, and waste requirements could result in significant changes in the structure of the U.S. power industry, especially in the eastern half of the country. 

TVA currently anticipates spending significant amounts on environmental projects through 2025, including investments in new clean energy generation including natural gas, nuclear, and renewables to reduce TVA's overall environmental footprint. TVA environmental project expenditures also result from coal-fired plant decommissioning and from effective ash management modernization. Based on TVA's decisions regarding certain coal-fired units under the Environmental Agreements, the amount and timing of expenditures could change. See Power Supply &#32; and Load Management Resources &#8212; Coal-Fired &#32;above and Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures &#32;below.

projects that may be required to comply with potential GHG regulations or transmission upgrades. 

(4) Includes projects that TVA is currently planning to comply with revised rules under the Clean Water Act (i.e., Section 316(b) and effluent limitation guidelines for 

steam electric power plants). 

Employees 

On September 30, 2016 , TVA had 10,691 employees, of whom 3,821 were trades and labor employees. Neither the federal labor relations laws covering most private sector employers nor those covering most federal agencies apply to TVA. However, the TVA Board has a long-standing policy of acknowledging and dealing with recognized representatives of its employees, and that policy is reflected in long-term agreements to recognize the unions (or their successors) that represent TVA employees. Federal law prohibits TVA employees from engaging in strikes against TVA.
