 IT EM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a private wireless communications carrier and provider of mobile workforce communication and location based solutions focused on increasing the productivity of our customers&#8217; field-based workers and the efficiency of their dispatch and call center operations. We have commenced launching private push-to-talk (&#8220;PTT&#8221;) networks in major markets throughout the United States. Our proprietary and industry-validated suite of mobile communications and workforce management applications improve team communication and field documentation across a wide array of industries, including transportation, distribution, construction, hospitality, waste management and field services. At the same time, we are pursuing broadband spectrum opportunities, including, but not limited to, a Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) regulatory process aimed at the realignment of our spectrum to be able to deploy broadband technologies to enterprises. &#160; 

Private Carrier Dispatch 

We are currently deploying and operating dedicated, wide-area, two-way radio networks that offer PTT communications services to primarily dispatch-centric, small and medium-sized businesses. In June 2015, we commercially launched our PTT service, which we market as DispatchPlus &#8482; , in the greater, Houston, Texas metropolitan area. We commenced service in six additional major metropolitan markets during fiscal 2016, including: Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, the greater New York area and Baltimore/Washington. 

We offer our DispatchPlus service, which combines pdvConnect &#8482; , our proprietary suite of mobile communication and workforce management applications with state-of-the-art digital network architecture and mobile devices supplied by Motorola Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Motorola&#8221;). Developed for dispatch-centric businesses, pdvConnect is an easy to use and efficient mobile communication and workforce management solution that enables businesses to locate and communicate with their field workers and improve the documentation of work events and job status. Also built with the commercial dispatch user in mind, Motorola&#8217;s digital network architecture allows us to provide highly reliable, instant and wide-area PTT communication services to our customers. We primarily market our DispatchPlus service indirectly through Motorola&#8217;s dealer network and select other third-party dealers, with sales, marketing and advertising support from our internal sales and marketing team. 

Industry Background 

Historically, the dispatch-centric enterprise market was primarily served by private networks constructed and operated by enterprises for their own use and by local Specialized Mobile Radio (&#8220;SMR&#8221;) operators. The first SMR operators received authorization from the FCC to offer services on their licensed spectrum in 1980. In 1987, Brian McAuley and Morgan O&#8217;Brien, our Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, founded Nextel Communications (&#8220;Nextel&#8221;) to acquire 800 MHz SMR licenses issued by the FCC and to launch what became a nationwide dispatch radio network. Motorola collaborated with them to introduce and deploy the Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (&#8220;iDEN&#8221;) technology on which the Nextel digital dispatch radio network was based. After developing the network and growing the total number of subscribers to approximately 23 million, Nextel merged with Sprint in August 2005 at a stand-alone value of approximately $36 billion. 

In June 2013, Sprint de-commissioned the legacy Nextel iDEN network in favor of deploying 4G broadband technologies, particularly the global standard LTE. At the same time, Sprint attempted to move its iDEN customers over to its deployed 4G network . I n addition to Sprint, most of the other large U.S. Tier 1 carriers offer a form of PTT &#160; service as part of their wireless service offerings . However, because these carrier PTT services are super-imposed on a broadband network designed primarily for telephony and data, many short-comings exist. Shortcomings can include latency (or delay) experienced after the PTT &#8220;button&#8221; has been pushed due to user unavailability or inactive applications , decreased quality of service , impaired overall functionality and reduced ease of use. While much innovation has been applied, and many downloadable dispatch applications have been developed by third parties, with varying degrees of success, we believe there are still fundamental issues in the way that one-to-one and one-to-many communications are currently handled on telephony and data-based networks and devices . The ease , reliability and simplicity of the iDEN service has been lost due to the complications that are inherent in any attempt to super-impose the desired PTT functionalities on networks and devices primarily designed for alternative uses. 

Our Spectrum Assets 

In September 2 014, we acquired the 900 MHz spectrum Sprint previously utilized to operate the legacy Nextel iDEN network for $100 million, comprising of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock. We estimate that we acquired our 900 MHz spectrum for approximately $0.06 per MHz for each of the U.S . population in our licensed market area s ( &#8220;MHz/POP&#8221;). Sprint divested this 900 MHz spectrum primarily because the channel assignments are non-contiguous and not currently useable for the broadband 4G technology it is deploying. As of March 31, 2016 , Sprint held approximately 3.50 % of our issued and outs tanding shares of common stock.

&#160;

The FCC has allocated spectrum in our portion of the 900 MHz band into 40, 10-channel blocks of contiguous channels alternating between blocks designated for operation of SMR commercial systems and blocks designated for Business/Industrial/Land Transportation (&#8220;B/ILT&#8221;) users, with FCC rules also enabling B/ILT licenses to be converted to SMR use. Subsequently, the FCC conducted overlay auctions on the SMR designated blocks that awarded geographic based licenses on a Major Trading Area (&#8220;MTA&#8221;) basis while affording operational protection to incumbent, site-based licensees in those areas. 

We are now the largest holder of FCC license s in the 900 MHz band, with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. In this band we hold , on average, approximately 60% of the total number of SMR and B/ILT channels in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States. In this band, we hold almost every SMR MTA geographic license in all but a few markets in the United States as well as certain licenses for B/ILT and converted B/ILT licenses in most major markets. As a result, we hold on average, 240 of the 400 total 900 MHz channels in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States. &#160; 

There are technology choices readily available for our existing spectrum position, across different types of services including narrowband voice dispatch and other data services (i.e. Machine-to-Machine, Internet of Things applications). 

Our Market Opportunity 

The demand for wireless telecommunications has grown rapidly over the last twenty years, driven by the increased availability of broadband data services, new applications, technological advancements in handsets and infrastructure , regulatory changes, increased competition and lower prices. Within the wireless telecommunications industry, we believe there is a s egment of users who value a tailored solution addressing the dispatch-centric nature of their businesses. These dispatch-centric businesses typically have mobile workforces and business operations that can be more efficiently managed with simple, instant and reliable communications among their employees and work groups . These businesses typically operate within industry verticals such as construction, distribution, transportation, field services, waste management and hospitality. Given the nature of their operations, we believe these businesses can benefit from instant PTT communication capabilities, which allow them to rapidly communicate with one touch of a &#8220;button&#8221; to another user (one-to-one) or to many users (one-to-many) within their organizations. In dispatch environments, PTT offers these businesses several advantages over telephony and data-based services, including an easy-to-operate one-touch button, efficiency of communications and rugged equipment optimal for field use. Overall, PTT can provide these businesses with functionality that increases the speed, simplicity and reliability of their communications , and also facilitates their ability to more effectively manage their mobile workforce and assets. &#160; 

In June 2014, we calculated the potential size of our addressable market for our DispatchPlus services by analyzing 20 major market areas in the United States. Based on that analysis, we estimate that there are approximately 6.8 million potential users for our DispatchPlus services that are employed by ou r target dispatch-centric customers within these markets , consisting of small and medium-sized businesses of 1,000 or fewer employees in the transportation, distribution, construction, hospitality , waste management, and field services verticals. This translates to an annual addressable market size of approximately $2 billion to $5 billion in these 20 major markets, assum ing these customers are willing to pay $25 to $60 per month , per user, for their wireless communication services. 

Our DispatchPlus Service &#160; 

For our targeted set of dispatch-centric small and medium-sized business customers, we o ffer our DispatchPlus service, which combines pdvConnect, our proprietary suite of mobile communication and workforce management applications, with Motorola&#8217;s state-of-the-art digital network architecture and mobile devices. We designed pdvConnect to help companies increase their productivity through the delivery of real-time information from mobile workers to dispatch operators. The solution enable s quick communication and response among field workers and streamlined dispatch operations through faster exchanges of information by prioritizing messages from the field, which can reduce or eliminate wasteful &#8220;on hold time . &#8221; In addition, pdvConnect allows our business customers to document field incidents and activities and to collect operational data and location based information to improve their operations. As a cloud-based solution, pdvConnect allow s users to deliver voice messages to any computer (via the internet) or to any phone on any network, thereby greatly enhancing the PTT communication capabilities of field workers and allowing them to communicate not only with personnel within their organizations, but also with suppliers, vendors and customers. 

We bundle pdvConnect with the Motorola PTT handsets and devices we offer to our customers , thereby integrating all essential components of the DispatchPlus service. Because pdvConnect is a cloud-based service offering, there is no requirement for our customers to download software to their devices before beginning to use pdvConnect. W e offer customers ou r DispatchPlus service at a monthly price that we believe is significantly lower than the price they would pay for comparable services and functionality from the large Tier 1 carriers . Based on our market research, the Tier 1 carriers currently charge their customers monthly fees of approximately $50 or more per user for a comparable set of service s and functionality (i.e., unlimited PTT, mobil e resource management solutions, SMS messages and data ).

&#160;

We primarily offer our DispatchPlus s ervice to customers indirectly by entering into sales representative agreements with existing wireless dealers selected from Motorola&#8217;s nation wide dealer network , which we believe consists of over 750 dealers nationwi de in more than 1,500 locations, and other select third-party wireless dealers. We support our indirect sales representatives by providing them with training, marketing and advertising support from our internal sales and marketing team. We are also evaluating and implementing a number of sales initiatives, including multiple types of lead generation programs and hiring additional sales resources. We believe this approach of utilizing existing wireless dealers to serve as our indirect sales representatives, coupled with our direct sales and marketing efforts and initiatives, will enable us to establish a presence in our markets and help to reduce the upfront costs of establishing a nationwide sales and distribution network. &#160; 

Currently, many of our target customers use PTT services provided by Tier 1 cellular carriers via cellular systems or SMR operators via local radio networks. We believe our proprietary DispatchPlus service offers the following significant advantages to our target customers when compared to the services currently offered by Tier 1 cellular carriers or local SMR operators. &#160; 

DispatchPlus versus Tier 1 Cellular Carrier Dispatch. For customers who require reliable dispatch radio service, we believe our solution is and will continue to be superior to current services provided by the Tier &#160; 1 carriers due to several key factors, including: 

&#183; 

Lower monthly price &#8211; We offer our &#160; DispatchPlus service at a monthly price that is significantly lower than the monthly service fees currently charged by Tier 1 cellular carriers for comparable services and functionality . 

&#183; 

Simplicity &#8211; The mobile devices we offer to our customers allow for one-button dispatch calls (one-to-one and one-to-many) that are purpose-built for and dedicated to dispatch and field use. 

&#183; 

Functionality &#8211; Our PTT network &#160; is dedicated to dispatch ( as opposed to being super-imposed on a network designed for telephony and &#160; data), allowing for decreased latency and improved functionality and overall ease of use. 

&#183; 

Support &#8211; We p rovide our customers with an enterprise-grade, dedicated customer support team with specific expertise in dispatch communications and mobile resource management solutions. 

DispatchPlus versus Traditional Local SMR Dispatch. We believe our solution is and will continue to be superior to the products offered by local SMR operators due to several key factors, including: 

&#183; 

Coverage &#8211; We have the opportunity to offer our customers consistent service across a greater coverage area given our national spectrum position . 

&#183; 

Simplicity &#8211; Our unique, p roprietary pdvConnect resource management tool is included as part of our DispatchPlus service for one low price. In contrast, on local SMR networks, users can only obtain some of the functionality of pdvConnect , but not all, by making separate purchases from third-party application vendors. 

&#183; 

Functionality &#8211; We believe the workforce enhancement features and functionality included in our pdvConnect mobile resource management solution, some of which are not offered on local SMR networks, allow our customers to recognize superior value and return on investment. 

&#183; 

Capacity &#8211; While many local SMR operators have constrained spectrum, the spectrum we acquired from Sprint will generally support significantly more customers per target market. 

pdvConnect. Historically, we have offered mobile resource management applications, marketed primarily under the name pdvConnect, to customers who utilize Tier 1 cellular networks. pdvConnect is our proprietary, cloud-based mobile resource management solution for dispatch-centric business customers. W hen offered as a stand-alone product, we market pdvConnect thr ough two Tier 1 carriers in the United States. We previously marketed pdvConnect through an international Tier 1 carrier in Mexico until our agreement with this carrier end ed during the second quarter of Fiscal 2016. We have entered into standard reseller, co-marketing and license agreements with these third-party Tier 1 carriers. Our Tier 1 carrier partners market pdvConnect as an available application to complement their wireless service offerings. Generally, pdvConnect has been offered at a monthly price of up to $19.99 per user . For the year ended March 31, 201 6 , approximately 99.6% and 0.4 % of our operating revenues from sales of pdvConnect were from domestic and international sales , respectively. Revenues from the t wo domestic carriers accounted for 39 % and 20% of our operating revenues for Fiscal 2016, respectively. Given our focus on offering our DispatchPlus service on our PTT network , we believe that sales of pdvConnect through our third-party carriers will continue to decrease as an overall percentage of our operating revenues. 

Our Spectrum Opportuni ties 

We are utilizing our non-contiguous 900 MHz spectrum to support the deployment of our narrowband PTT business in major markets throughout the United States. W e anticipate the demand for high speed data and video services, even in the case of our targeted PTT customer s, will provide an impetus for change to broadband technologies over the longer term. Accordingly, we are pursuing a regulatory process with the FCC aimed at realigning our spectrum to be able to deploy broadband technologies. &#160; In addition to this regulatory action, we are also pursuing a number of other spectrum initiatives. We believe the past experience and successes of our management team , combined with our anticipated market position as a leading private carrier dedicated to businesses , will provide us with the opportunity to increase the value of our existing spectrum and allow us to pursue additional &#160; spectrum opportunities.

&#160;

Our Joint Petition for Rulemaking 

In November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC to propose the realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband. We believe this realignment is consistent with the FCC&#8217;s mandate to promote more efficient use of limited spectrum resources generally and its ongoing efforts to make more spectrum available for broadband services specifically, particularly in the spectrum bands below 1 GHz. In response to the Joint Petition for Rulemaking , the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested third parties and ask ed a number of questions about the &#160; proposal . A number of interested third parties, including several incumbent licensees , filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and opposition , and asking a number of technical questions about our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. I n May 2015, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition for Rulemaking . Comments on the proposed rules were filed in June 2015 and reply comments in July 2015 . The proposed rules outline our recommended procedural and technical operating parameters, including field strength limits, processes related to the administration and sequenc ing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band and requirements for the broadband operators to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the cost of their realignment and to utilize an emission mask with advanced filtering capability specifically designed to protect licensees adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band. &#160; &#160; 

We have responded to all requests for information from the FCC and other interested parties, and we are currently awaiting FCC action. &#160; The FCC&#8217;s action may take a number of forms ranging from: a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, to a Notice of Inquiry, to a dismissal of the Joint Petition without further action. To our knowledge, the FCC has not reached a decision on our Joint Petition. We currently believe that the most likely outcome is that the FCC will adopt a Notice of Inquiry as the next step in the process. However, at this time we do not know the content or scope of any potential Notice of Inquiry. A Notice of Inquiry is a vehicle for the FCC to gather additional information for the record. If the FCC elects to adopt a Notice of Inquiry, it could request additional information and input on the optimal use of the 900 MHz band generally. A Notice of Inquiry could also request information on the specific issues and proposed solutions raised by us and other commentators during the proceeding. The adoption of a Notice of Inquiry does not mean that the FCC has denied our Joint Petition, or that our Joint Petition will not ultimately result in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and, thereafter, the adoption of rules providing for a 900 MHz broadband allocation. We continue to believe in the merits of our proposal and that our Joint Petition is consistent with the FCC&#8217;s past practices and policies. Nevertheless, obtaining a favorable result from the FCC may take a significant amount of time and resources . Moreover , there is no assurance that the FCC will adopt our proposed rules, or ultimately approve our Joint Petition. Further, the FCC may impose a number of requirements or restrictions on our business as a condition of its potential approval of our realignment request, which may include provisions in addition to the procedural and technical parameters and requirements already recommended in our proposed rules . Any such requirements or restrictions may impede or delay our realignment plans, result in our realignment plans being more costly than we currently anticipate or impede our ability to pursue or implement our future broadband initiatives. 

Additional &#160; Strategic Initiatives 

In addition to pursuing our Joint Petition for Rulemaking, we continue to engage in a number of spectrum initiatives, including: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Acquiring Spectrum Assets. We have completed a limited number of spectrum acquisitions to support our current and contemplated realignment efforts and the deployment of a future broadband network . &#160; We have prioritized, and intend to continue to prioritize , our acquisitions on spectrum licenses, including SMR blocks and site specific licenses, in major metropolitan areas that we believe will ease the process of re aligning a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband assuming the FCC approves our Joint Pet ition for Rulemaking. To date, we have pursued these acquisitions opportunistically and selectively to help avoid unduly driving up the cost of the spectrum licenses we acquire. We intend to continue this opportunistic and selective acquisition strategy, pending further developments in the FCC proceeding. 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Discussions with Incumbents . We have met, and intend to continue to meet, with a number of incumbent licensees and interested parties in the 900 MHz band, including a number of those who submitted comments to the FCC regarding our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. Our goal with these discussions is to gain a better understanding of the size of the incumbent base and the nature of the systems they are currently operating. We are attempting to build consensus with these incumbents and to resolve any concerns they have expressed regarding our Joint Petition. 

&#65279;

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing a Strategic Plan. &#160; We identified critical infrastructure and enterprise businesses as the initial targeted customers for any future 900 MHz broadband network we deploy. We believe that building such a dedicated broadband network and providing priority access to the critical infrastructure industry could serve as a natural extension of our existing PTT network and business. We also believe there are opportunities to serve these future broadband customers with current technology solutions to provide an evolutionary path to broadband. We have engaged in market research and have retained outside resources to assist us in developing a strategic plan for this and other potential market opportunities. We are also evaluating other potential market opportunities and related potential targeted customer groups that could allow us to leverage our nationwide spectrum position now and in the future. Our efforts to develop such a strategic plan are aimed at maximizing the long-term value of our business opportunities and our spectrum assets. 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Technology Evaluation. Our engineering team has also evaluated the technical requirements of any future broadband network in the 900 MHz band and specifically, whether existing technology can be utilized to support our potential future network buildout and business plans. These evaluations have helped us to obtain a higher level of confidence that a broadband network can be deployed using spectrum in the 900 MHz band with careful engineering and the use of appropriate filters and other equipment and technology that is commercially available at this time. 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Additional Spectrum Opportunities. In addition to our broadband opportunities in the 900 MHz band, we intend to use the experience and relationships of our executive management team to evaluate and potentially pursue additional spectrum and related wireless service opportunities. One potential opportunity we have been exploring relates to the First Responder Network Authority ( &#8220; FirstNet &#8221; ) , which involves a Congressionally mandated process that provides 20 MHz of spectrum and up to $6.5 billion of funding for the build-out and operation of a prioritized Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network ( &#8220; NPSBN &#8221; ) that also may be used, on a non-priority, excess capacity basis, to meet the wireless service needs of commercial customers. 

A s part of our efforts to continue to explore the FirstNet opportunity, we assembled a robust consortium of companies and filed a response to FirstNet&#8217;s RFP (request for proposal) by the May 31, 2016 deadline. 

Although we understand that a number of other bidders or bidder groups are competing for the FirstNet opportunity, we determined that continuing to explore this opportunity, via the RFP process, was in our stockholders&#8217; best interests because of a number of benefits to the company. Independent of the outcome of the RFP process, synergies between the NPSBN and our planned broadband facilities could include the coordination of communications between our respective customer targets, first responders for the NPSBN and critical infrastructure entities for our 900 MHz facilities, and the potential to share network deployment, capital and operating costs. In addition, we can directly utilize the business, technical and other information developed for the FirstNet proposal in planning and preparing for the broadband facilities we plan to deploy. Further, participating with a consortium of leading wireless and technology companies has enabled us to establish valuable relationships with these companies and helped to raise the Company&#8217;s profile within the wireless industry and the technology community, all of which can benefit our existing spectrum initiatives and lead to further opportunities. We also believe that we have access to skilled and experienced personnel and other resources well suited to pursuing opportunities involving the NPSBN. 

The FirstNet RFP process is expected to continue for many months, and now that we have submitted our response to the RFP, our activities will be primarily driven by questions or requests issued to us by FirstNet. Given that this is a competitive government RFP process that is governed by confidentiality restrictions, we do not intend to provide interim updates except to the extent required under applicable securities laws. 

Of course, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our pursuit of spectrum opportunities related to FirstNet or any other spectrum opportunities that we identify, or in recognizing the benefits we identified related to our continued exploration of the FirstNet opportunity, or in converting our non-contiguous licensed spectrum holdings to contiguous spectrum allocations suitable for broadband uses.

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following strengths can provide us with a significant competitive advantage in implementing our business strategy: 

Executive Team Track Record. Our senior executive team has a long, proven track record, with over 80 years of combined experience in the wireless telecommunications and dispatch radio industry. They are considered to be leaders in the industry and led the creation of the first all-digital nationwide wireless network that brought PTT to the mass business and consumer markets. Brian McAuley and Morgan O&#8217;Brien, our Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, were the co-founders of Nextel. While Mr. O&#8217;Brien remained on the board at Nextel, Mr. McAuley, after serving as Nextel&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer for seven years, went on to found NeoWorld Communications in 1999. NeoWorld was subsequently purchased by Nextel in 2003. In addition, several members of our current management team held leadership roles at Nextel, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Pescatore, Leon Frazier, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, T imothy G ray, our Chief Financial Officer, Robert Schwartz, our Chief Strategy and Development Officer, and Thomas Sidman, our Chief Legal Officer . We believe the combined strength of our executive team provides us with a significant competitive advantage to both develop our business as a private carrier dedicated to businesses and critical infrastructure entities and pursue additional spectrum initiatives . 

Dedicated PTT Network. We believe our ability to offer a dedicated PTT network to our targeted dispatch-centric business customers in major markets throughout the United States will be a significant competitive advantage. Although the Tier 1 cellular carriers offer some form of PTT service s , these PTT s ervices are super-imposed on a network designed primarily for telephony and d ata-based services. As a result, there can be many short-comings , including latency ( or delay ) issues, as well as decreased quality of service , impaired functionality and reduced overall ease of use. O ur PTT network solution, which is dedicated to dispatch, restores the speed, simplicity and reliability demanded by our targeted dispatch-centric customers and enhance s their communications within their organizations and with their suppliers, vendors and customers. 

Integrated Mobile Resource Management Solution. Our DispatchPlus service bundle s our pdvConnect mobile resource management solution with a dedicated PTT network and customer handsets and devices designed for dispatch and PTT communications . This service enable s quick communication and response among workers in the field and streamlined dispatch operations through faster exchanges of information by prioritizing messages from the field, which can reduce or eliminate wasteful &#8220;on hold time .&#8221; Because pdvConnect is a cloud-based service offering, there is no software on the subscriber device, which makes it easier for our customers to deploy and to begin utilizing pdvConnect. 

Attractive Pricing Model. We believe our DispatchPlus service offers significant value to our dispatch-focused customers , and arguably greater value than our competitors&#8217; PTT offerings. We offer our solution at a monthly price that is significantly lower than the monthly fees currently charged by Tier 1 cellular carriers for their &#160; PTT with comparable mobile resource management solutions . While SMR dispatch providers may offer their solutions at competitive prices, we believe our DispatchPlus service provide s two significant value advantages over our SMR competitors : (i) we have the ability to offer greater coverage given our nationwide spectrum position and (ii) our service include s our proprietary pdvConnect solution, only some features of which can be obtained on local SMR networks through separate purchases from multiple third-party application providers . 

Lower Deployment Costs . We are deploying our PTT network using the high-site, high-power digital network architecture developed by Motorola. This technology allows us to provide services to major market areas with , on average, 10 to 12 sites per market, as compared to the hundreds of sites required by the low-site, low-power architectures that many of our Tier 1 carrier competitors utilize. We believe this technology-based coverage advantage will drive significantly lower deployment costs and ongoing operating and maintenance expenses versus our Tier 1 carrier competitor s. In addition, given the amount of &#8220;prime&#8221; (below 1 GHz) spectrum we acquired and particularly the price at which we acquired it, we believe our cost for spectrum is considerably less than recent industry transactions. Also, because our pdvConnect solution becomes integrated with the business operations of our customers and our customer s elect to make an investment in the PTT equipment we offer when they select our solution, our customer churn rate can be lower than the customer churn rate experienced by Tier 1 carriers . This lower customer churn rate can help to reduce our overall customer acquisition costs and to driv e a more predictable revenue stream. 

Strategic Relationships. We have long-standing relationships with customers, vendors and wireless industry leaders. We have entered into a reseller agreement with Motorola, under which Motorola is provid ing us with its state-of-the-art digital technology for our PTT network and the mobile handsets and devices we offer to our customers. We also agreed to purchase equipment manufactured by Motorola for any future broadband network we deploy, provided that Motorola makes reasonable efforts to ensure the equipment meets our required sourcing criteria. Further, we are leverag ing Motorola&#8217;s nationwide dealer network, which we believe consists of over 750 dealers nationwide in more than 1,500 locations, as the primary channel to sell our DispatchPlus service. &#160; Coupled with the support of our internal sales and marketing programs, w e believe this approach will enable us to establish a presence in our markets and help to reduce the upfront cost s of establishing a nationwide sales and distribution network. &#160; In addition to our arrangements and relationship with Motorola, we believe our long-standing relationships with our customers and wireless industry leaders will help us build our dispatch business and pursue our spectrum initiatives .

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

We intend to pursue the following business strategies to build our business and to enhance the long-term value of the Company : 

Deploy Our PTT Network . We are a licensee of nationwide spectrum in the 900 MHz band. We intend to establish our PTT network in major markets throughout the United States. Within these markets, we intend to offer our DispatchPlus service to our targeted dispatch-centric business customers . As the only nationwide licensee focused solely on the PTT dispatch business , we have the opportunity to offer strong dispatch-only coverage throughout the United States, which will allow us to serve businesses with a presence in more than one local market. In addition, over time, we believe this national presence can provide us with both the scale and leverage that our existing local SMR competitors may have difficulty achieving. We commenced service in seven major metropolitan market areas, including Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, the greater New York area and Baltimore/Washington. &#160; 

Provide a Differentiated PTT Service. Following Sprint&#8217;s decision to de-commission the legacy Nextel iDEN network in June 2013, we believe a compelling opportunity to provide a differentiated PTT service has emerged. DispatchPlus, comprised of our proprietary pdvConnect mobile communication and resource management solutions and Motorola&#8217;s PTT digital technology network architecture and mobile devices, provides our customers with instant PTT communication &#160; abilities combined with a holistic workforce management solution . DispatchPlus offers the speed, simplicity, reliability and efficiency our dispatch-centric customers demand, and provides them with the opportunity to achieve greater workplace efficiency and return on investment than existing competitive PTT offerings. &#160; 

Acquire and Retain the Most Valuable Customers. We intend to continue to focus on acquiring and retaining the most valuable business customers spanning industry verticals that have historically been dispatch-centric. These verticals include construction, distribution, transportation, field services, waste management and hospitality. Given the potential advantages of our DispatchPlus service over current PTT and dispatch solutions, we believe that we have the opportunity to gain market share as our customers choose our solution for a variety of factors, including price, quality of service, functionality, reliability and ease of use. In addition, because our solution is integrated with a customer&#8217;s business processes and the customer makes an investment in user equipment when they select our solution, we believe that the churn rate of our target customers can be significantly lower than the churn rate experienced by Tier 1 cellular carriers, which can help us to driv e a more predictable revenue stream. 

Leverage our Established Industry Relationships. Due to our executive team&#8217;s long, proven track record, we have significant market expertise and established industry relationships. We have significant relationships with wireless industry leaders , vendors and PTT operators. We intend to leverage these relationships in order to provide us with both a strategic and operational advantage. In addition, we intend to leverage our existing relationships to continue to hire and retain experienced and successful sales, operating, and technology personnel. We have entered into a reseller agreement with Motorola, who is providing us with the di gital t echnology that we are using for our PTT network and for the mobile handsets and devices we offer to our customers. We also are utiliz ing Motorola&#8217;s existing dealer network as the principal channel to sell our DispatchPlus service in our existing launched markets. &#160; 

Strategically Expand Service Offerings and Enhance Geographic Market Presence. Once we have successfully entered and demonstrated acceptable levels of sales productivity and financial performance in our initial major markets, we intend to further expand and enhance our geographic market presence into other attractive market areas. That expansion may be through a variety of means, including deploying our own PTT network , leasing spectrum and/or through joint ventures . We are also evaluating the potential to leverage our network deployments and spectrum to expand our solutions beyond voice dispatch. &#160; 

Increase the Value of Our Spectrum. &#160; We are now the largest holder of FCC licenses in the 900 MHz band, with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. We hold, on average, approximately 60% of the total number of 900 MHz SMR and B/ILT licensed channels i n the top 20 metropolita n markets in the United States. W e anticipate the demand for high speed data and video services, even in the case of our targeted PTT customers , will provide an impetus for change to expanded service offerings, including broadband technologies, over the longer term. Accordingly, in November 2014 , &#160; we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC to propose realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz spectru m from narrowband to broadband. In addition to this regulatory action, we are also pursuing a number of broadband spectrum initiatives. We believe the past experience and successes of our management team , combined with our anticipated market position as a leading private dispatch carrier, will provide us with the opportunity to increase the value of our spectrum and allow us to pursue additional spectrum opportunities. &#160;

Our PTT Network and Mobile Device Offerings &#160; 

Our PTT Network. &#160; Motorola has developed and designed the state-of-the-art digital technology we are utilizing for our PTT network. For over 80 years, Motorola has set the standard for dispatch radio and PTT network technology. The Motorola digital technology &#160; we are utilizing puts PTT at the core of functionality , i n contrast to existing cellular technologies, such as the former iDEN network . In addition, the Motorola digital technology network architecture is not based on the low-elevation, low-power, multi-site configurations used for cellular technologies, which can require hundreds &#160; of cell sites in a general market or metropolitan area. Instead, the architecture of the Motorola d igital t echnology is high-site, high-power , with a limited number of sites required in a general market or metropolitan area to provide on-street coverage. As a result, this technology platform and related siting approach allow us to deploy our PTT network on a limited number of sites in a metropolitan area (on average, 10 to 12 sites per major metropolitan area) when compared to the far greater number of sites we would be required to deploy if we relied on cellular technologies and network design approaches . Our network is also be ing designed and deployed for optimum PTT performance and functionality, and will support both one-to-one and one-to-many communications. Finally, because the Motorola d igital t echnology is already a commercially proven technology, our PTT network deployment is not subject to typical developmental risk or supply delays. 

Our PTT Devices. &#160; The mobile handsets and vehicle-mounted devices we offer to our customers are also built to incorporate the Motorola d igital t echnology. These devices provide the functionality to allow &#8220;one button&#8221; PTT communications. In addition, these devices are larger, more powerful, and more &#8220;ruggedized&#8221; than typical cell phones and/or smartphones. We also include pdvConnect, our proprietary mobile resource management solution, with the DispatchPlus service. Since it is a cloud-based solution, our customers are not required to download any additional software before using the features offered by pdvConnect. &#160; 

Our DispatchPlus Services 

For our &#160; targeted set of dispatch-centric small and medium-sized business customers, we offer our DispatchPlus service. DispatchPlus, utilizing Motorola&#8217;s state-of-the-art digital PTT technology, provides our targeted customers with the voice quality and dependability they demand. In addition to providing PTT functionality , DispatchPlus include s our proprietary pdvConnect mobile communication and resource management solution. This proprietary service offering is designed to give customers the ability to instantly set up PTT communications &#8211; either privately (one-to-one) or with a group (one-to-many) &#8211; within their calling area with just the touch of a &#8220;button.&#8221; In addition, pdvConnect can help companies increase productivity through the delivery of real-time information from mobile workers to dispatch operators, incl uding Global Positioning System &#160; ( &#8220;GPS&#8221; ) tracking and real time location, worker status, activity repo rting and field event logging. p dvConnect can also integrate with corporate intranets and back-office systems, such as sales force automation, order entry, inventory tracking and customer relationship management.

Our Sales and Marketing Strategy 

We target our DispatchPlus service for small and medium-sized businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees that operate in industry verticals that, given the nature of their business and their asset and human resource profile, have historically been dispatch-centric. These verticals include construction, distribution, transportation, field services, waste management and hospitality. We believe our DispatchPlus service can provide these businesses with the instant communication services they need, and, coupled with our pre-packaged pdvConnect communication and resource management solution, the speed and simplicity they need to operate efficiently. We offer our services on a no-contract basis, with services billed on a monthly basis . &#160; 

We are establish ing our PTT dispatch network in major markets throughout the United States. We have commenced service in the following seven major metropolitan areas during fiscal 2016, including Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, the greater New York area, and Baltimore/Washington. The criteria we use for selecting markets , as well as the order of our network rollout , &#160; is based on a number of factors, including: &#160; the overall population size of the market, the number of dispatch-centric businesses in the market, the cost and effort required to establish our network in the market, the existing competition in the market and the strength of our sales representatives in the market. 

We primarily offer our DispatchPlus service to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives. We are currently selecting our sales representatives from Motorola&#8217;s nationwide dealer network, which we believe consists of over 750 dealers nationwide in more than 1,500 locations, and from select third-party wireless dealers. We support our indirect sales representatives by providing them with training, sales, marketing and advertising support from our internal sales and marketing team. We also support our indirect sales representatives by placing a PDV dealer manager in each market in which we operate. In addition, we are evaluating and implementing a number of sales initiatives, including multiple types of lead generation programs and hiring additional sales resources. We believe this approach of utilizing existing wireless dealers, to serve as our indirect sales representatives, coupled with our direct sales and marketing efforts and initiatives, will enable us to establish a presence in our markets and help to reduce the upfront costs of establishing a nationwide sales and distribution network. 

To date, sales of our DispatchPlus service have been slower to ramp-up than our initial expectations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, the performance of our indirect third-party sales representatives, longer initial sales cycle, and coverage gaps in certain markets due to delays in our deployment of planned sites that were not or have not yet been completed. On the positive front, our sales prospects are growing and initial feedback from early customers and prospects indicates strong interest in our DispatchPlus service offering. Further, we are currently focusing our resources on the seven markets where we have commenced service. That focus includes trialing and implementing a number of sales and marketing initiatives and strategies aimed at increasing sales of our DispatchPlus service and developing a predictable sales funnel and process. These initiatives include: 

&#183; 

Identifying and targeting high-value, small and medium-sized business customers that we believe will benefit from our DispatchPlus service; 

&#183; 

Focusing our advertising and marketing efforts on communicating the benefits of our services to business customers in our targeted market verticals; 

&#183; 

Developing and bringing to market innovative features that continue to differentiate us from other wireless communications service providers that provide PTT solutions; 

&#183; 

Providing additional incentive programs to our third-party sales representatives and prospects; 

&#183; 

Building and trialing a business development direct sales team in one of our seven markets and adding limited direct sales resources in the other markets ; 

&#183; 

Developing a centralized business development and telesales team to increase flow of qualified leads and sales across all of our market areas; and 

&#183; 

Beginning to develop alternate sales channel strategies and identifying new sources of sales and leads in our targeted market verticals. 

We intend to continue to focus our efforts on the initial seven markets where we have commenced service until we prove out our DispatchPlus business model in those markets. We have continued to prepare for the rollout of our DispatchPlus service in more than thirteen additional markets by completing initial network designs and in some markets pursuing site development efforts, including site selection and lease negotiation. This approach will allow us to more quickly and effectively proceed with new market deployments when we determine it is best to do so. We also believe this approach will provide us with additional time and financial flexibility to refine our longer term strategies including those related to our Joint Petition.

Our Competition 

T he market for wireless and dispatch communication services has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, performance, technology advances and the features, functionality, quality and reliability of the offered s ervices and products. With respect to our DispatchPlus service, we compete with a number of wireless Tier 1 carriers . Most of these competitors offer some form of PTT service , along with a selection of mobile resource management solutions . In addition to the Tier 1 carriers, we also compete with local SMR and other dispatch service providers who offer PTT services to our targeted dispatch-centric business &#160; market verticals. &#160; With respect to our broadband and other spectrum initiatives, we compete with the Tier 1 carriers, local SMR operators and other public and private companies that are in the business of acquiring and developing spectrum assets. In addition, our joint petition is opposed by certain incumbents and other third parties with conflicting business interests. Many of the t hird parties who are not supportive of our broadband initiative or with whom we compete against for spectrum opportunities may have more resources, and greater political and regulatory influence, than we do . 

Our Relationship with Sprint Corporation 

I n May &#160; 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sprint (the &#8220;Sprint APA&#8221;) to acquire: (i) FCC licenses to operate a nationwide dispatch network in the 900 MHz band and (ii) certain 900 MHz equipment. We paid Sprint an aggregate of $100 million for these assets , consisting of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. In September 2014, we obtained the necessary approvals from the FCC to transfer the FCC licenses from Sprint to the Company, and we completed the closing of the purchase and sales of the spectrum assets (the &#8220;Spectrum Closing&#8221;). 

Our Relationship with Motorola 

We signed a reseller agreement with Motorola pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, and Motorola agreed to supply us with, the Motorola digital technology we are utilizing to deploy our PTT network and the mobile handsets and devices we are offering to our customers . Additionally, Motorola invested $10 million in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC, that we formed to hold our 900 MHz spectrum licenses. Motorola&#8217;s ownership interest in our subsidiary is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. Motorola is not entitled to any profits , dividends or other distribution from the operations of our subsidiary. 

In addition, we entered into a lease agreement with Motorola in which our subsidiary agreed to lease a portion of our 900 MHz licenses in exchange for an upfront, fully-paid lease fee of $7.5 million. Under the terms of this lease agreement with Motorola, Motorola can use the leased channels to provide narrowband services to certain qualified end-users. The end-users can only use the leased channels for their own internal communication purposes. The end-users cannot sublease the channels to any other end-users or to any commercial radio system operations or carriers. The lease agreement specifically states that the channels leased to Motorola will not be used in a manner that would be competitive with our services and limits the total number of channels that Motorola can lease in any market area. The lease agreement provides us with flexibility regarding the future use and management of our spectrum, including setting forth relocation and repurposing policies for or affecting the leased channels. 

Motorola cannot enter contracts with end-users after December 31, 2020 without our consent and the payment of an additional fee. The initial lease period for any end-user cannot last more than seven years, and the lease can only be renewed for up to three years for an aggregate lease period of up to 10 years. In addition, we agreed to purchase equipment manufactured by Motorola for any future broadband network we deploy, provided that Motorola makes reasonable efforts to ensure the equipment meets our required sourcing criteria. 

Our Intellectual Property 

To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and service offerings , we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We implemented a patent strategy designed to protect our technology and facilitate the commercialization of our service offerings. Currently, our patent portfolio is comprised of s even issued U.S. patents, two issued European patents and &#160; two issued Canadian patent s, all of which have been assigned to and are owned by us . In addition, we have several trademarks and service marks to protect our corporate name, services offerings, goodwill and brand. There are currently no claims or litigation regarding these trademarks, patents, copyrights, or service marks. We also rely on trade-secret protection of our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants when appropriate.

&#160;

The Regulation of Our Business 

We hold FCC spectrum licenses in the 900 MHz band as a non-interconnected, non-common carrier SMR service provider, and are subject to regulation as a Private Mobile Radio Service (&#8220;PMRS&#8221;) licensee by the FCC. The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, operation and acquisition of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings in the United States. Within the limitations of their spectrum holdings and available technology, PMRS operators are authorized by the FCC to provide non-interconnected mobile communications services, including two-way radio dispatch (sometimes referred to as walkie-talkie), and mobile data and internet services. 

Licensing . &#160; &#160; As a PMRS licensee, we are required to provide our wireless communication services on specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules , regulations and policies adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each spectrum license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of the FCC licenses we currently hold . While the FCC has generally renewed licenses held by operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause an d to deny a license renewal if it determines that a license renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance is unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC rules and regulations require us to obtain the FCC&#8217;s prior approval before assigning or transfer ring control of wireless licenses, with limited exceptions. The FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations also govern spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses, including the licenses we hold. These same requirements apply to any licenses or leases we may wish to acquire as part of our broadband initiatives. T he FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on any proposed acquisitions, sales or other transfers of control of licenses or leases . The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation or sale of spectrum licenses or leases and may apply a spectrum &#8220;screen&#8221; in examining such transactions. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide wireless service, if the FCC were to disapprove any such request to acquire, assign or otherwise transfer a license or lease, our business plans would be adversely affected. Approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state or local regulatory authorities, also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum. 

900 MHz Band Spectrum Reconfiguration . &#160; FCC approval will be required to allow repurposing of 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband and to allow the realignment of the 900 MHz spectrum so that it is capable of supporting the LTE technology consistent with our long-range broadband initiatives . A decision by the FCC declining to permit the needed spectrum repurposing and subsequent realignment activities could have a significant adverse effect on the value of our spectrum and on our future plans for provision of broadband services. 

FCC Regulations . The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by PMRS providers. However, w e may be subject to other FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings that may affect spectrum aggregation limits and/or adjustment of the FCC&#8217;s case-by-case spectrum screens; regulation surrounding the deployment of advanced wireless broadband infrastructure; the imposition of text-to-911 capabilities; and the transition to IP networks, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. We are unable to predict how these pending or future FCC proceedings may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable FCC regulations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures. 

State and Local Regulation. In addition to FCC regulation, we are subject to certain state regulatory requirements. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any PMRS provider. State and local governments are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from wireless providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government. The siting of base stations also remains subject to some degree of control by state and local jurisdiction. States also may impose competitively neutral requirements that, among other things, are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state E911 services programs, to protect the public safety and welfare, and to safeguard the rights of customers.

&#160;

Tower Siting . &#160; In connection with deploying and operating our PTT network , we may be required to comply with various federal, state and local regulations that govern the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas, including requirements imposed by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration. FCC rules subject certain tower site locations to extensive zoning, environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties, including State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy facilities. The FCC has, however, imposed a tower siting &#8220;shot clock&#8221; that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe, which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers. The FCC antenna structure registration process also imposes public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of, or modification to, antenna structures required to be registered with the FCC, potentially adding to the delays and burdens associated with tower siting, including potential challenges from special interest groups. To the extent governmental agencies continue to impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process, the time and cost to construct towers could be negatively impacted. 

Motor Vehicle Restrictions. A number of states and localities have banned or are considering banning or restricting the use of wireless handsets and devices while driving a motor vehicle, which in many instances could include the use of PTT devices. Such bans could cause a decline in the number of minutes of use by business customers or make our service less attractive to certain potential subscribers. 

Electronic Surveillance. We may be required by law to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies. If required, we intend to deliver the requisite surveillance capabilities to law enforcement with respect to our PTT service. 

National Security . &#160; National security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal, state and local levels. For example, Congress is expected to again consider cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation&#8217;s digital infrastructure. In 2013, the President issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to take a number of steps to improve the security of the nation&#8217;s critical infrastructure. The details surrounding the implementation of this order have not been resolved, however, and we cannot predict the cost impact of such measures. Moreover, the FCC continues to examine issues of network resiliency and reliability and may seek to impose additional regulations designed to reduce the severity and length of disruptions in communications. 

Our Employees 

As of March 31, 201 6 , we had 8 1 f ull-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement . W e believe that our relationship with our employees is positive.
