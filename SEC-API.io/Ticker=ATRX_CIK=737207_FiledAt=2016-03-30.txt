 ITEM 1. Business. &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of nucleic acid-based therapies to treat orphan diseases. Our pipeline includes CEQ508, a product in clinical development for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (&#8220;FAP&#8221;), for which we have received both Orphan Drug Designation (&#8220;ODD&#8221;) and Fast Track Designation (&#8220;FTD&#8221;) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), and preclinical programs for the treatment of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (&#8220;DM1&#8221;) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (&#8220;DMD&#8221;).

&#160;

As further described below under &#8220;Strategic Direction and Agreement to Sell Company Assets&#8221;, on March 10, 2016 we entered into a term sheet with Microlin Bio, Inc. (&#8220;Microlin&#8221;) pursuant to which we would sell to Microlin substantially all of the assets of our historical business operations.

&#160;

Since 2010, we have strategically acquired/in-licensed and further developed nucleic acid chemistry and delivery-related technologies in order to establish a novel and differentiated drug discovery platform. This platform allows us to distinguish ourselves from others in the nucleic acid therapeutics area in that we are the only company capable of creating a wide variety of therapeutics targeting coding and non-coding RNA via multiple mechanisms of action such as RNA interference (&#8220;RNAi&#8221;), messenger RNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, microRNA (&#8220;miRNA&#8221;) replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action. Our goal has been to improve the lives of the patients and families affected by orphan diseases through either our own efforts or those of our collaborators and licensees.

&#160;

The breadth of our discovery platform allows us to pursue the most appropriate nucleic acid-based therapeutic approach, which is necessary to effectively modulate targets for a specific disease indication, many of which are considered undruggable by traditional methodologies. Each approach, i.e. small interfering RNA (&#8220;siRNA&#8221;), miRNA or single-strand oligonucleotide, has its advantages and disadvantages, and we can screen across multiple mechanisms of action to identify the most effective therapeutic. We believe this capability makes us unique amongst our peers. Currently, we employ our platform, primarily through the efforts of our partners and licensees, to discover and develop multiple nucleic acid-based therapeutics including siRNA, miRNA mimics and single stranded oligonucleotide-based compounds. Our pipeline is orphan disease focused and includes a clinical program in FAP and preclinical programs in DM1 and DMD. Our licensees, ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;ProNAi&#8221;), Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Mirna&#8221;) and MiNA Therapeutics, Ltd. (&#8220;MiNA&#8221;), are focused on oncology and have clinical programs in recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma and unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement.

&#160;

We have entered into multiple licenses for our technology. The following agreements continue to provide upside opportunity for our company in the form of milestones and/or royalties:

&#160;

&#183; Mirna &#8211; In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mirna, a privately-held biotechnology company pioneering miRNA replacement therapy for cancer, regarding the development and commercialization of miRNA-based therapeutics utilizing Mirna&#8217;s proprietary miRNAs and our novel SMARTICLES&#174;-based liposomal delivery technology (&#8220;SMARTICLES&#8221;). In December 2013 and May 2015, we amended this agreement such that Mirna paid certain pre-payments to us and now has additional rights to its lead program, MRX34, currently in Phase 1 clinical development. In addition, Mirna optioned exclusivity on several additional miRNA targets. We could receive up to an additional $44 million in clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties in the low single digit percentages on sales, based on the successful development of Mirna&#8217;s product candidates. &#160;

&#183; ProNAi &#8211; In March 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ProNAi, a privately-held biotechnology company pioneering DNA interference (&#8220;DNAi&#8221;) therapies for cancer, regarding the development and commercialization of DNAi-based therapeutics utilizing SMARTICLES. We could receive up to $14 million for each gene target in total upfront, clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties in the single digit percentages on sales, with ProNAi having the option to select any number of additional gene targets. For example, if ProNAi licenses five products over time under the license agreement, we could receive up to $70 million in total milestones, plus royalties. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Monsanto Company &#8211; In May 2012, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Monsanto Company (&#8220;Monsanto&#8221;), a global leader in agriculture and crop sciences, covering the agricultural applications for our delivery and chemistry technologies. We could receive royalties on product sales in the low single digit percentages based on the successful development of Monsanto&#8217;s product candidates that use our technologies. &#160;

&#183; Rosetta Genomics &#8211; In April 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Rosetta Genomics, Ltd. (&#8220;Rosetta&#8221;) to identify and develop miRNA-based products designed to diagnose and treat various neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies. Under the terms of the alliance, Rosetta will apply its industry leading miRNA discovery expertise for the identification of miRNAs involved in the various dystrophy diseases. If the miRNA is determined to be correlative to the disease, Rosetta may further develop the miRNA into a diagnostic for patient identification and stratification. If the miRNA is determined to be involved in the disease pathology and represents a potential therapeutic target, we may develop the resulting miRNA-based therapeutic for clinical development. The alliance is exclusive as it relates to neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies, with both companies free to develop and collaborate outside this field both during and after the terms of the alliance. &#160; 

&#183; MiNA &#8211; In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with MiNA regarding the development and commercialization of small activating RNA-based therapeutics utilizing SMARTICLES. We received an upfront fee of $0.5 million in January 2015 and a milestone payment of $200,000 in November 2015. We could receive up to an additional $49 million in clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales, based on the successful development of MiNA&#8217;s product candidates. &#160; 

&#183; Hongene Biotechnology &#8211; In September 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Hongene Biotechnology (&#8220;Hongene&#8221;), a leader in process development and analytical method development of oligonucleotide therapeutics, regarding the development and supply of certain oligonucleotide constructs using our conformationally restricted nucleotide (&#8220;CRN&#8221;) technology. We could receive double digit percentage royalties on the sales of research reagents using our CRN technology. &#160;

Our business strategy has been to discover and develop our own pipeline of nucleic acid-based compounds in order to commercialize drug therapies to treat orphan diseases. Orphan diseases are broadly defined as those rare disorders that typically affect no more than one person out of every 1,500 people. The United States Orphan Drug Act of 1983 was created to promote the development of new drug therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, an orphan disease is a disease for which a regulatory agency, i.e. FDA or European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;), can grant ODD to a compound being developed to treat that particular disease. In other words, if the FDA will grant ODD for a compound being developed to treat a disease, then that disease is an orphan disease. The purpose of such designations is to incentivize pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop drugs to treat smaller patient populations. In the U.S., ODD entitles a company to seven years of marketing exclusivity for its drug upon regulatory approval. In addition, ODD permits a company to apply for: (1) grant funding from the U.S. government to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, (2) tax credits for clinical research expenses and (3) exemption from the FDA's prescription drug application fee. Over the past several years, there has been a surge in rare disease activity due in part to the efforts of advocacy groups, the media, legislation and large pharmaceutical interest. Yet, orphan diseases continue to represent a significant unmet medical need with fewer than 500 drug approvals for over 7,500 rare diseases; clearly demonstrating the necessity for innovation in the development of therapeutics to treat orphan diseases. Our lead effort is the clinical development of CEQ508 to treat FAP, a rare disease for which CEQ508 received FDA ODD in 2010 and FTD in 2015. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for the treatment of FAP. In April 2012, we announced the completion of dosing for Cohort 2 in the Dose Escalation Phase of the START-FAP (Safety and Tolerability of an RNAi Therapeutic in FAP) Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. We have not yet initiated Cohort 3 due to our financial condition. We have also been awaiting additional funding to advance pre-clinical programs in DM1 and DMD through to human proof-of-concept.

&#160;

At the same time, we have sought to establish collaborations and strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

biotechnology companies to generate revenue through up-front, milestone and royalty payments related to our technology and/or the products that are developed using such technology. Our focus has been to establish such collaborations and partnerships in order to generate sufficient funding to advance our pipeline.

&#160;

In order to protect our innovations, which encompass a broad platform of both nucleic acid-based therapeutic chemistry and delivery technologies, as well as the drug products that may emerge from that platform, we have aggressively built upon our extensive and enabling intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) estate worldwide. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled 146 issued or allowed patents, and approximately 98 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, to protect our proprietary nucleic acid-based drug discovery capabilities.

&#160;

We believe we have created a unique industry-leading nucleic acid-based drug discovery platform, which is protected by a strong IP position and validated through: (1) licensing agreements for our SMARTICLES delivery technology with Mirna, ProNAi and MiNA for unique nucleic acid payloads &#8211; microRNA mimics, DNA interference oligonucleotides and small-activating RNA, respectively; (2) Mirna and ProNAi&#8217;s respective clinical experience with SMARTICLES; (3) a licensing agreement with Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. (&#8220;Novartis&#8221;) for our CRN technology; (4) a licensing agreement with Protiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Arbutus&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (formerly Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation), for our Unlocked Nucleobase Analog (&#8220;UNA&#8221;) technology; (5) licensing agreements with two large international companies (i.e., Novartis and Monsanto) for certain chemistry and delivery technologies; and (6) our own FAP Phase 1b/2a clinical trial with the TransKingdom RNA&#8482; interference (&#8220; tk RNAi&#8221;) platform.

&#160;

Strategic Direction and Agreement to Sell Company Assets 

&#160;

As a result of our financial condition, on February 17, 2016 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, and that we have retained Objective Capital Partners, LLC as our exclusive advisor to assist us in exploring such alternatives.

&#160;

In connection with that process of exploring strategic alternatives, on March 10, 2016, we entered into a term sheet with Microlin Bio, Inc. (&#8220;Microlin&#8221;) pursuant to which we would sell to Microlin substantially all of the assets of our historical business operations in consideration of: (i) the issuance to us by Microlin of 6.7 million shares of Microlin common stock, which shares shall represent approximately 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of Microlin common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately following the issuance of such shares; and (ii) the payment by Microlin to us of $0.75 million in cash (the &#8220;Microlin Transaction&#8221;). Microlin&#8217;s purchase of our assets is expected to close by July 1, 2016 pending the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including execution of the definitive asset purchase agreement, subsequent approval of the Microlin Transaction by Marina stockholders and Microlin&#8217;s completion of a financing of at least $5 million. It is also contemplated that Microlin will provide a bridge loan in the amount of approximately $0.3 million upon entering into the asset purchase agreement. Following the closing of the Microlin Transaction, substantially all of the assets relating to our historical business will be owned by Microlin, and we will no longer be operating that business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the proposed Microlin Transaction.

&#160;

The sale of assets to Microlin is the first step in creating what we believe is the greatest value opportunity for our stockholders. We believe that our proprietary chemistries and delivery technologies are best suited for development of therapeutic compounds that modulate non-coding RNA. Therefore, we feel that these technologies are synergistic and complementary to Microlin&#8217;s microRNA assets and that Microlin is in a strong position to move these assets forward. We believe the second step to creating value for our stockholders is the acquisition of other assets or a reverse merger.

&#160;

We filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to the Microlin Transaction on March 16, 2016. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating the Microlin Transaction.

&#160;

We will need additional capital in order to execute our strategy of concluding the Microlin Transaction, either acquiring other technology or completing a reverse merger, or if the Microlin Transaction is not consummated, our previous strategy to initiate the registration trial for and to commercialize CEQ508, file Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) applications for both DM1 and DMD and bring these two programs to human proof-of-concept.

&#160;

Recent Licensing Agreements 

&#160;

On February 16, 2016, we entered into an evaluation and option agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing technology. The agreement contains an option provision for the exclusive license of our SMARTICLES platform in a specific gene editing field. This agreement and our platforms under this agreement will be included in the Microlin Transaction.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On March 14, 2016, we entered into a license agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $0.25 million, and could receive up to $40 million in success-based milestones. The upfront license fee will be retained by our company, but this agreement and our platforms under this agreement will be included in the Microlin Transaction.

&#160;

Liquidity 

&#160;

We have sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $334.5 million ($108.8 million of which has been accumulated since we focused on RNA therapeutics in June 2008), negative working capital of $1.6 million and $0.7 million in cash. We have been funded through a combination of licensing payments and debt and equity offerings. As a result of our financial condition, during the period between June 2012 and March 2014, substantially all of our research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) activities were placed on hold, we exited all of our leased facilities, and all of our employees, other than our chief executive officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), either resigned or were terminated. Due to our current financial condition, our R&#38;D activities have again been placed on hold.

&#160;

We believe that our current cash resources, including the upfront license fee received in March 2016 as noted above, will enable us to fund our intended operations through June 2016 and the closing of the Microlin Transaction. Our ability to execute our operating plan beyond June 2016 depends on our ability to obtain additional funding, the closing of the Microlin Transaction, and any subsequent plans to acquire other technology or execute a reverse merger.

&#160;

The volatility in our stock price, as well as market conditions in general, could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional capital when required, we may have to modify, delay or abandon some or all of our planned activities, or terminate our operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

&#160;

Nucleic Acid-Based Therapeutics 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Nucleic acid-based therapeutics typically target two types of RNA &#8211; coding RNA and non-coding RNA. The targeting of coding RNA is usually associated with inhibition, or the down-regulation, of a specific mRNA via RNAi or mRNA translational inhibition, i.e. a single therapeutic inhibiting the protein expression of a single gene. The targeting of non-coding RNA is usually associated with the modulation (up or down) of a regulatory RNA via miRNA replacement therapy or miRNA inhibition, i.e. a single therapeutic repressing/de-repressing the expression of multiple genes (and thus proteins). The Nobel Prize winning discovery of RNAi in 1998 led not only to its widespread use in the research of biological mechanisms and target validation but also to its application in down-regulating the expression of disease-causing proteins. In this case, the RNAi-based therapeutic, typically a double-stranded siRNA, acts through a naturally occurring process within cells that has the effect of reducing levels of mRNA required for the production of proteins. RNAi enables the targeting of disease at a genetic level and thus is highly specific to particular disease-causing proteins. Like RNAi-based therapeutics, certain single stranded anti-sense oligonucleotides (&#8220;ASO&#8221;) can also interact with mRNA by inhibiting translation (commonly referred to as mRNA translational inhibition) and likewise are highly specific to a disease-causing protein. On the other hand, miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are important in both gene regulation and protein translation. miRNAs exert their biological effect upstream of the RNAi pathway and can ultimately influence the RNAi process. Similar to a siRNA or ASO, a miRNA mimic, which increases the level of a miRNA in the cell, can inhibit protein expression. However, unlike a siRNA or translational inhibitor that targets just one gene, a miRNA mimic can simultaneously repress the expression of multiple proteins associated with the genes controlled by that miRNA target. miRNA antagonists (or antagomirs), which bind to the natural miRNA in the cell and prevents the activity of that miRNA, can allow the simultaneous &#8220;de-represssion&#8221; of multiple proteins associated with the genes under control of a single miRNA target. The term de-repression is used to describe the biological process, i.e. the binding of a naturally occurring miRNA by an antagomir causes the miRNA to forego its normal activity in repressing/inhibiting protein expression. In other words, the antagomir removes the brakes a miRNA applies to protein expression resulting in increased protein expression. The overall result of an antagomir and miRNA inhibition is an increase in protein expression downstream of the target miRNA. This type of nucleic acid-based therapeutic sets itself apart not only from other nucleic acid-based therapeutics (i.e. siRNA, ASO mRNA translational inhibitors and miRNA mimics), but also from the majority of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies in that it is one of the few mechanisms of action that can cause an increase in protein expression. In summary, nucleic acid-based therapeutics target genes to either prevent the expression of disease causing proteins or to increase protein expression where the absence of the protein contributes to a disease state.

&#160;

&#160;

Although nucleic acid-based therapeutics are being developed for a number of diseases in therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, inflammation, and oncology, perhaps the greatest single opportunity for such therapeutics is in orphan diseases. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics are being advanced in indications characterized by &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets; that is targets that cannot be modulated by small molecule or monoclonal antibodies. Therapeutic targets to treat rare and orphan diseases are typically &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets. Within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, nucleic acid-based therapeutics are being developed for over a dozen rare and orphan diseases including: Alport Syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Friedreich&#8217;s Ataxia, Hemophilia, Hepatic Porphyrias, Hereditary Angioedema, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Huntington&#8217;s Disease, Primary Hyperoxaluria (Type I), Myotonic Dystrophy (Type 1), Sickle Cell Disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Transthyretin Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy. Various nucleic acid-based compounds are in either preclinical or clinical development for the above diseases and include both single- and double-stranded constructs such as: siRNA, miRNA mimics, antagomirs, and ASO utilizing various mechanisms of action such as: RNAi, mRNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, miRNA replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking. We believe a company that has the capability to develop both single- and double-stranded constructs with sufficient breadth of delivery technologies to get those constructs to the proper cellular targets can capitalize on the specific strength of various nucleic acid mechanisms of action thus creating the greatest chance for clinical success. We believe this multi-faceted approach is particularly applicable for rare and orphan disease indications. Such a capability has the possibility to significantly reduce the risks of failure associated with: (1) off-the-shelf chemistry and/or delivery, (2) one-off proprietary chemistry and/or delivery technologies or (3) mechanism of action.

&#160;

In 2010, we executed on a strategy to consolidate key intellectual property and technologies necessary to create a broad nucleic acid drug discovery platform with the capability to develop both single- and double-stranded constructs and to deliver those constructs to the proper cellular targets. Besides a key chemistry &#8211; CRN &#8211; which provides us the freedom to develop single-stranded constructs, we acquired two additional delivery technologies providing us: (1) an ability to deliver oligonucleotides via oral administration to treat gastro-intestinal disorders and (2) a significant expansion of our lipid-based delivery capability. With these acquisitions and the further development and advancement of those technologies from 2010 to the present, we feel we have established the broadest nucleic acid drug discovery platform in the sector and validated that platform through the following partnerships and licensing transactions: (1) ProNAi licensing SMARTICLES for systemic administration of a DNAi oligonucleotide to treat recurrent and relapsed non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma &#8211; currently in Phase 2 human testing; (2) Mirna licensing SMARTICLES for systemic administration of a miRNA mimic to treat unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement &#8211; currently in Phase 1 human testing; (3) Novartis licensing our CRN technology in connection with the development of both single and double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics; (4) Arcturus licensing our UNA technology in connection with the development of siRNAs utilizing RNAi for the down-regulation of gene expression; (5) Monsanto licensing certain of our delivery and chemistry technologies for agricultural applications; and (6) MiNA licensing SMARTICLES for systemic administration of a small activating RNA to treat unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement and liver diseases. Further, between the clinical programs of ProNAi and Mirna with SMARTICLES and our own clinical program using the tk RNAi technology, we believe we are the only company in the space whose delivery technologies are being used, in human clinical trials, to deliver three different types of nucleic acid compounds via two modes of administration: (1) oral administration of a double-stranded shRNA; (2) systemic administration of a double-stranded miRNA mimic and (3) systemic administration of a single-stranded DNA decoy. We believe every other company&#8217;s technologies, in clinical development, are limited to a single mode of administration (only intravenous, intramuscular and sub-cutaneous) and a single nucleic acid payload.

&#160;

Together with our existing and potential future partners, the intention of our historical operations has been to continue to build our understanding of the unique chemistry and delivery technologies we have assembled in order to effectively develop novel nucleic acid-based therapeutics for the treatment of human disease while minimizing the risk of failure. It had been out intention to focus our development efforts toward certain orphan disease indications and collaborate with both biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the development of other orphan and non-orphan diseases.

&#160; 

Nucleic Acid-Based Drug Discovery Platform 

&#160;

Through the advancement of our FAP clinical program and pre-clinical programs in DM1 and DMD, we have taken steps to make improvements in both areas crucial to the development of nucleic acid-based therapeutics: constructs and delivery technologies. Although each area is equally important to the development of an effective therapeutic, the scientific challenges of delivery are one of the most significant obstacles to the broad use of nucleic acid-based therapeutics in the treatment of human disease including orphan diseases.

&#160; 

UsiRNA Constructs . Our UsiRNAs, which are siRNA with substitution of UNA bases in place of RNA bases in key regions of the double-stranded construct, have shown important advantages in terms of efficacy and safety, when compared to standard siRNA molecules and modifications. UsiRNAs are highly active in rodent-based disease models,

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

non-disease rodent models, and non-human primates. UsiRNAs function via RNAi to cut the targeted mRNA into two pieces in such a manner that the target mRNA can no longer function and thereby decreasing the production of the protein associated with the gene target. In the case of bladder cancer, liver cancer and malignant ascites, the UsiRNAs decrease tumor growth in the respective rodent disease model. UsiRNAs have demonstrated a lower potential for cytokine induction and provide resistance to nuclease degradation, two effects that are often prominent with standard siRNAs. Most importantly, substitution with UNA at specific sites greatly increases the specificity for RNAi and improves their profile for therapeutic use. Substitution in the passenger strand can eliminate the ability of this strand to act in the RNAi pathway and, thereby, the potential for unwanted effects on other targets or competition with guide strand activity by loading into the intracellular RNAi machinery. Substitution of UNA within the guide strand can eliminate miRNA-like effects that occur with standard siRNA. This miRNA-like off-target activity cannot often be addressed by bioinformatics and can result in severe loss of activity if addressed with standard chemical modification of RNA. Overall these data indicate that not only do UsiRNAs maintain potent RNAi activity, they may also have superior drug like properties, through a combination of greater target specificity, improved safety and lower total dosing, when compared to typical siRNA-based compounds resulting in more effective protein down-regulation.

&#160; 

Conformationally Restricted Nucleotides (CRN) . CRNs are novel nucleotide analogs in which the flexible ribose sugar is locked into a rigid conformation by a small chemical linker. By restricting the flexibility of the ribose ring, CRNs can impart a helix-type structure typically found in naturally occurring RNA. For single stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics, the impact of CRN substitution dramatically increases the therapeutics&#8217; affinity for the target mRNA or miRNA while imparting significant resistance to nuclease degradation. Additionally, CRNs can significantly improve the thermal stability of double-stranded constructs, such as siRNAs. We reported in vivo dose-dependent efficacy with a CRN-substituted antagomir against miRNA-122 (&#8220;miR-122&#8221;). The efficacy in a rodent model was demonstrated by up to a 5-fold increase in AldoA, a well-known downstream gene regulated by miR-122. In addition, downstream targets GYSI and SLC7A1 were also elevated. The increase in these downstream gene targets was achieved by the sequestration of miR-122 by a high affinity CRN-substituted antagomir. In addition, the CRN-substituted antagomir, which was dosed for three consecutive days at up to 50 mg/kg/day, was extremely well tolerated in rodents as evidenced by normal serum chemistry parameters and no body weight changes. CRNs are critical to our ability to develop single-stranded oligonucleotides.

&#160; 

Delivery . We have two liposomal-based delivery platforms. The first platform, SMARTICLES, defines a novel class of liposomes that are fully charge-reversible particles allowing delivery of active substance (siRNA, single-stranded oligonucleotides, etc.) inside a cell either by local or systemic administration. SMARTICLES-based liposomes are designed to ensure stable passage through the bloodstream and the release of nucleic acid payloads within the target cell where they can exert their therapeutic effect by engaging either the RNAi pathway or directly with mRNA. To date, SMARTICLES-delivered nucleic acid drug candidates, which have been administered to approximately 100 patients, have demonstrated: (1) delivery to tumor in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials; (2) statistically significant, dose-dependent, and specific knockdown of a gene target in a Phase 1 clinical trial; (3) single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) in a Phase 2 clinical trial; and (4) anti-tumor efficacy with both single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides in rodent models.

&#160;

ProNAi&#8217;s clinical compound, PNT2258, is a first-in-class, 24-base, single-stranded, chemically-unmodified DNA oligonucleotide drug targeting BCL2. PNT2258 exhibits single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with recurrent or refractory NHL. Eighty-two percent of patients had tumor shrinkage when receiving single-agent therapy with PNT2258. To date, overall response rate in patients with follicular lymphoma is 40 percent and in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma overall response is 50 percent. PNT2258 is safe at a dose of 120 mg/m2 administered intravenously for 2 to 3 hours on days 1 through 5 of a 21-day schedule. No tumor lysis syndrome or major organ toxicities were observed. No occurrences of elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, renal failure/dysfunction, or infections were noted nor were any Grade 4 toxicities. PNT2258 drug exposure levels (AUC) exceeded by at least four-fold that required for anti-tumor activity in xenograft studies of human tumors, consistent with the Phase 1 trial. In addition, as reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December 2014, investigators for the study concluded that: (1) PNT2258 treatment results in significant, durable responses in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (r/r NHL); (2) eleven of the thirteen (11/13) patients treated achieved clinical benefit, with ongoing Progression Free Survival (PFS) extending to 18 months and beyond; (3) PNT2258 is demonstrably active in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) &#8211; all four of the patients (4/4) with DLBCL responded to PNT2258, with three patients achieving complete responses (CR) and one patient achieving a partial response (PR), with durations extending to greater than 500 days; (4) durable and clinically meaningful CR&#8217;s and PR&#8217;s were achieved in subjects with aggressive disease, such as Richter&#8217;s transformation and Burkitt&#8217;s-like DLBCL; (5) noteworthy durable CR&#8217;s and PR&#8217;s were also observed in subjects with advanced stage follicular lymphoma (FL); and (6) PNT2258 therapy is safe and very well-tolerated with dosing periods up to and exceeding 18 months. In January 2015, ProNAi reported that the first patient with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had enrolled in the &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; Phase 2 study and had been treated with PNT2258.

Mirna&#8217;s clinical compound, MRX34, is a double-stranded miRNA &#8220;mimic&#8221; of the naturally occurring tumor suppressor miR-34, which inhibits cell cycle progression and induces cancer cell death. The Phase 1 MRX34 study, for the treatment of patients with unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement, is designed with an initial dose-escalation phase of approximately 30 patients, followed by an expansion phase of approximately 18 additional patients after the recommended Phase 2 dose has been identified. MRX34 is administered intravenously twice a week for three weeks with one week off, during 28-day cycles, until disease progression or intolerance. Interim safety data from the multicenter, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial of MRX34 showed that MRX34 has a manageable safety profile with only one incident of a dose-limiting toxicity observed to date. In addition, as reported at the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer in November 2014, data show that MRX34 has a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), other solid tumors with liver metastasis, and hematological malignancies. At the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in April 2015, Mirna reported that a molecular analysis of white blood cells from patients treated with MRX34 showed a dose dependent repression of several key oncogenes previously identified as direct miR-34 targets including FOXP1, BCL2, HDAC1 and CTNNB1. These data suggest delivery of miR-34 into human white blood cells and engagement of several biological targets of miR-34. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 110mg/m2 for MRX34 administered twice weekly for three weeks followed by one week off. While this Phase 1 study is intended to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dosing regimens, treatment with MRX34 has provided early signals of clinical activity in advanced cancer patients with primary liver, neuroendocrine, colorectal and small cell lung cancers, as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

&#160;

We believe the combined clinical delivery experiences of ProNAi and Mirna are impressive and that SMARTICLES is a potential product differentiator in the further development of our orphan disease clinical pipeline.

&#160;

The second platform utilizes amino-based liposomal delivery technology and incorporates a novel and proprietary molecule we call DiLA2 (Di-Alkylated Amino Acid). Our scientists designed this molecule based on amino acid (e.g., peptide/protein-based) chemistry. A DiLA2-based liposome has several potential advantages over other liposomes, such as: (1) a structure that may enable safe and natural metabolism by the body; (2) the ability to adjust liposome size, shape, and circulation time, to influence bio-distribution; and (3) the ability to attach molecules that can influence other delivery-related attributes such as cell specific targeting and cellular uptake. Our formulations for delivery of UsiRNAs, using different members of the DiLA2 family, have demonstrated safe and effective delivery in rodents with metabolic targets (e.g., ApoB) and in cancer models using both local and systemic routes of administration. Safe and effective delivery with DiLA2-based formulations has also been achieved in non-human primates.

&#160;

In addition to our liposomal-based delivery platforms, we have used peptides for both the formation of stable siRNA nanoparticles as well as targeting moieties for siRNA molecules. This research has included: (1) the use of peptide technology to &#8220;condense&#8221; siRNAs into compact and potent nanoparticles; (2) screening of our proprietary Trp Cage phage display library for targeting peptides; and (3) internal discovery and development of peptides and other compounds recognized as having cellular targeting or cellular uptake properties. The goal in the use of such technologies is to minimize the amount of final drug required to produce therapeutic response by increasing the potency of the drug product as well as by directing more of the final drug product to the intended site of action.

&#160; 

TransKingdom RNA&#8482; interference (tkRNAi) platform . tk RNAi is a broad-reaching platform that can be used to develop highly specific drug products for a diverse set of diseases. The tk RNAi platform involves the modification of bacteria to deliver short-hairpin RNA (&#8220;shRNA&#8221;) to cells of the gastrointestinal tract. A significant advantage of the tk RNAi platform is oral (by mouth) delivery making this platform extremely patient friendly while harnessing the full potential of the RNAi process. The tk RNAi platform has demonstrated in vivo mRNA down-regulation of both inflammatory and cancer targets, thus providing a unique opportunity to develop RNAi-based therapeutics against inflammation and oncology diseases such as Crohn&#8217;s Disease, ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. For our own clinical pipeline, we have used the tk RNAi platform to discover and develop CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP.

&#160; 

Clinical Program . CEQ508 is being developed for the treatment of FAP, a hereditary condition that occurs in approximately 1:10,000 persons worldwide. FAP is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. As a result of these mutations, epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract have increased levels of the protein &#223;-catenin, which in turn results in uncontrolled cell growth. Proliferation (uncontrolled cell growth) of the epithelial cells results in the formation of hundreds to thousands of non-cancerous growths (polyps) throughout the large intestine. By age 35, 95% of individuals with FAP have developed polyps and most will experience adverse effects including increased risk of bleeding and the potential for anemia. In more severe cases, obstruction of the intestines, abdominal pain, and severe bouts of diarrhea or constipation can occur. FAP patients are also at an increased risk of various cancers but specifically colon cancer. If measures are not taken to prevent the formation of polyps or to remove the polyps, nearly 100% of FAP patients will develop colon cancer. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for the treatment of FAP. For many patients, complete colectomy (surgical removal of the entire large

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

intestine), usually performed in the late teenage years or early twenties, is the only viable option for treatment. However, surgical intervention is not curative as the risk of polyps forming in the remaining portions of the intestinal tract and in the small intestine continues after colectomy. Most people with the genetic condition are in registries maintained in clinics and state institutions. Based on limited prevalence data, we believe the U.S. and European FAP patient population are each approximately 30,000 patients, with another 40,000 patients in Asia.

&#160;

CEQ508 is the first drug candidate in a novel class of therapeutic agents utilizing the tkRNAi platform and the first orally administered RNAi-based therapeutic in clinical development. CEQ508 comprises attenuated bacteria that are engineered to enter into dysplastic tissue and release a payload of shRNA, a mediator in the RNAi pathway. The shRNA targets the mRNA of &#223;-catenin, which is known to be dysregulated in classical FAP. CEQ508 is being developed as an orally administered treatment to reduce the levels of &#223;-catenin protein in the epithelial cells of the small and large intestine. Upon enrollment in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, patients are placed in one of four dose-escalating cohorts. Following completion of the dose escalation phase, the trial plan calls for a stable-dose phase in which patients will receive the highest safe dose. Under the trial protocol, CEQ508 is administered daily in an oral suspension for 28 consecutive days. In April 2012, we announced the completion of dosing for Cohort 2 in the Dose Escalation Phase of the START-FAP (Safety and Tolerability of an RNAi Therapeutic in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis) clinical trial of CEQ508. We have not proceeded with the dosing of Cohort 3 patients due to our financial condition.

&#160;

The FDA granted ODD and FTD to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP. Orphan drug designation entitles us to seven years of marketing exclusivity for CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP upon regulatory approval, as well as the opportunity to apply for: (1) grant funding from the U.S. government to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, (2) tax credits for clinical research expenses and (3) exemption from the FDA's prescription drug application fee. Further, FTD permits more frequent communications with the FDA and may facilitate the receipt of Accelerated Approval and Priority Review for CEQ508.

&#160; 

Pre-Clinical Programs . With the breadth of our nucleic acid-based drug discovery platform, we believe we are in a unique position to develop both single- and double-stranded clinical candidates to treat various neuromuscular disorders and dystrophies within the orphan drug space. Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control voluntary muscles, such as those that control the arms and legs. Nerve cells, also called neurons, send messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between the nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, muscles weaken and waste away. Likewise, dystrophies are progressive degenerative disorders affecting skeletal muscles. In both cases, the diseases can often affect other organ systems such as the heart and central nervous system. Many neuromuscular diseases and almost all dystrophies are genetic, which means there is a mutation in the genes which in many cases is passed from parent to child. Although a cure for these disorders may present itself in the future, the goal of our drug development effort has been to improve symptoms, increase mobility and increase the individual&#8217;s lifespan. We have pursued pre-clinical efforts in two orphan disease indications &#8211; DM1 and DMD.

&#160;

Myotonic dystrophy is one of a classification of inherited disorders named muscular dystrophies. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood and is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Individuals with this disorder often have prolonged muscle contractions (myotonia) and are not able to relax certain muscles after use. There are two major types of myotonic dystrophy: type 1 and type 2. Signs and symptoms overlap, although type 2 tends to be milder than type 1. Myotonic dystrophy affects at least 1:8,000 people worldwide. The prevalence of the two types of myotonic dystrophy varies among different geographic and ethnic populations. In most populations, type 1 appears to be more common than type 2.

&#160;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare muscle disorder affecting approximately 1:3,500 male births worldwide. Like myotonic dystrophy, DMD is also characterized by muscle wasting and weakness starting first in the pelvic area followed by shoulder muscles. DMD is typically diagnosed between three and six years of age. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness and wasting spreads to the trunk and forearms and gradually progresses to involve additional muscles of the body. The disease is progressive and most affected individuals require a wheelchair by the teenage years. Serious life-threatening complications may ultimately develop including disease of the heart muscle and respiratory difficulties.

&#160;

We believe our delivery technologies, combined with our CRN chemistry, could facilitate the development of best-in-class miRNA antagonists and mimics as well as ASO targeting translational inhibition and exon-skipping ASOs targeting cytosine-uracil-guanine (CUG) repeats in affected mRNA for the treatment of DM1 and DMD. Further, the ability to work with all of these modalities is potentially critically important to the treatment of these multi-system diseases, as the disease is not limited to skeletal muscle but also affects the heart and central nervous system. While current technologies are limited by either a single-stranded or a double-stranded approach, our platform could allow the pursuit of whichever nucleic acid modality most effectively treats each diseases.

&#160; 

Rosetta &#8211; On April 1, 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Rosetta to identify and develop miRNA-based products designed to diagnose and treat various neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies. Under the terms of the alliance, Rosetta will apply its industry leading miRNA discovery expertise for the identification of miRNAs involved in the various dystrophy diseases. If the miRNA is determined to be correlative to the disease, Rosetta may further develop the miRNA into a diagnostic for patient identification and stratification. If the miRNA is determined to be involved in the disease pathology and represents a potential therapeutic target, Marina may develop the resulting miRNA-based therapeutic for clinical development. The alliance is exclusive as it relates to neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies, with both companies free to develop and collaborate outside this field both during and after the terms of the alliance.

&#160;

Arcturus &#8211; On August 9, 2013, we and Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Arcturus&#8221;) entered into a Patent Assignment and License Agreement, pursuant to which we assigned our UNA technology for the development of RNAi therapeutics to Arcturus. In consideration for entering into the agreement, we received a one-time payment in full of $0.8 million for the Patent Assignment and License Agreement and transferred the Protiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (i.e. Arbutus) and Ribotask AsP license agreements to Arcturus. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, we retained a worldwide, fully-paid, royalty free, non-exclusive license to the UNA technology equal to the non-exclusive rights licensed by Arbutus and F. Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (rights owned now by Arrowhead Research, Inc.).

&#160; 

Arbutus &#8211; On November 28, 2012, we entered into a License Agreement with Arbutus, whereby we provided Arbutus a worldwide, non-exclusive license to our UNA technology for the development of RNAi therapeutics. Arbutus will have full responsibility for the development and commercialization of any products arising under the License Agreement. In consideration for entering into the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $0.3 million, and are eligible to receive milestone payments upon the satisfaction of certain clinical and regulatory milestone events and royalty payments in the low single digit percentages on products developed by Arbutus that use UNA technology. Arbutus may terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety, or in respect of any particular country or countries, by giving 90 days prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events involving the other party, or, following the expiration of a 120 day cure period &#160; (60 days in the event of a &#160; default of a payment obligation by Arbutus), upon the occurrence of a material breach of the agreement by the other party. With the purchase of the UNA asset by Arcturus in August 2013, the Arbutus License Agreement transferred to Arcturus.

&#160; 

Novartis &#8211; On August 2, 2012, we and Novartis entered into a worldwide, non-exclusive License Agreement for our CRN technology for the development of both single and double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics. We received a $1.0 million one-time payment for the non-exclusive license. In addition, in March 2009, we entered into an agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we granted to Novartis a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to our DiLA2-based siRNA delivery platform in consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of $7.25 million, which was recognized as license fee revenue in 2009. Novartis may terminate this agreement immediately upon written notice to us.

&#160; 

Avecia &#8211; On May 18, 2012, we and Avecia Nitto Denko (&#8220;Avecia&#8221;) entered into a strategic alliance pursuant to which Avecia will have exclusive rights to develop, supply and commercialize certain oligonucleotide constructs using our CRN chemistry. We are in the process of renegotiating this agreement due to Avecia&#8217;s strategic business requirements and our recent license agreement with Hongene. We expect that under the revised agreement, Avecia would provide us a robust supply of current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) material for the pre-clinical, clinical and commercialization needs of our company and our partners.

&#160; 

Monsanto &#8211; On May 3, 2012, we and Monsanto entered into a worldwide exclusive Intellectual Property License

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Agreement for our delivery and chemistry technologies. On May 3, 2012, we and Monsanto also entered into a Security Agreement pursuant to which we granted to Monsanto a security interest in that portion of our intellectual property that is the subject of the License Agreement in order to secure the performance of our obligations under the License Agreement. Under the terms of the license agreement, we received $1.5 million in initiation fees, and may receive royalties on product sales in the low single digit percentages. Monsanto may terminate the License Agreement at any time in whole or as to any rights granted thereunder by giving prior written notice thereof to us, with termination becoming effective three months from the date of the notice.

&#160; 

ProNAi &#8211; On March 13, 2012, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with ProNAi regarding the development and commercialization of ProNAi&#8217;s proprietary DNAi-based therapeutics utilizing SMARTICLES.

Either party may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of a default by the other party (subject to standard cure periods), or upon certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. ProNAi may also terminate the License Agreement without cause upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice to us.

&#160; 

Mirna &#8211; On December 22, 2011, we entered into a License Agreement with Mirna regarding the development and commercialization of miRNA-based therapeutics utilizing Mirna&#8217;s proprietary miRNAs and SMARTICLES. The License Agreement provides that Mirna will have full responsibility for the development and commercialization of any products arising under the License Agreement and that we will support pre-clinical and process development efforts. Under terms of the License Agreement, we could receive up to $63 million in upfront, clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties in the low single digit percentages on sales, based on the successful development of Mirna&#8217;s product candidates. Either party may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of a default by the other party. Mirna may also terminate the License Agreement without cause upon 60 days prior written notice to us. We and Mirna entered into two amendments to this agreement in December 2013 and in May 2015, pursuant to which Mirna made certain pre-payments to us in the aggregate amount of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and now has additional rights to its lead program, MRX34. Further under the amendment, Mirna optioned exclusivity on several additional miRNA targets.

&#160; 

Novosom &#8211; On July 27, 2010, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we acquired the intellectual property of Novosom AG (&#8220;Novosom&#8221;) of Halle, Germany for SMARTICLES, which significantly broadens the number of approaches we may take for systemic and local delivery of our proprietary UNA and CRN-based oligonucleotide therapeutics. We issued an aggregate of .014 million shares of our common stock to Novosom as consideration for the acquired assets. The shares had a value equal to approximately $3.8 million, which was recorded as research and development expense. As additional consideration for the acquired assets, we will pay to Novosom an amount equal to 30% of the value of each upfront (or combined) payment actually received by us in respect of the license of liposomal-based delivery technology or related product or disposition of the liposomal-based delivery technology by us, up to $3.3 million, which amount will be paid in shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our discretion. To date we have issued an aggregate of 1.9 million shares of common stock to Novosom representing additional consideration of $1.1 million as a result of the license agreements and amendments to such license agreements that we entered into with our partners.

&#160; 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals &#8211; On March 23, 2010, we acquired intellectual property related to our CRN chemistry from Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America (&#8220;Valeant&#8221;) in consideration of payment of a non-refundable licensing fee of $0.5 million which was included in research and development expense in 2010. Subject to meeting certain milestones triggering the obligation to make any such payments, we may be obligated to make a product development milestone payment of $5.0 million and $2.0 million within 180 days of FDA approval of a New Drug Application for our first and second CRN related product, respectively. To date, we had not made any such milestone payments but have milestone obligations of $0.1 million based on CRN licenses to date. Valeant is entitled to receive earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low single digits of future commercial sales and earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low double digits of future revenue from sublicensing. Under the agreement we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one covered product. If we have not made earn-out payments of at least $5.0 million prior to March 2016, we are required to pay Valeant an annual amount equal to $50,000 per assigned patent which shall be creditable against other payment obligations. We do not expect to achieve the earn-out minimum prior to March 2016. The term of our financial obligations under the agreement shall end, on a country-by-country basis, when there no longer exists any valid claim in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon 30 day notice, or upon 10 day notice in the event of an adverse results from clinical studies. Upon termination, we are obligated to make all payments accrued as of the effective date of such termination but shall have no future payment obligations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

University of Helsinki &#8211; On June 27, 2008, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Dr. Pirjo Laakkonen and the Biomedicum Helsinki. The goal of the work involves our patented phage display library, the Trp Cage library, for the identification of peptides to target particular tissues or organs for a given disease. In December 2009, we received a patent allowance in the U.S. covering a targeting peptide for preferential delivery to lung tissues that was identified by us using the Trp Cage Library. We believe the Trp Cage library will be a source of additional peptides for evaluation in our delivery programs, and we will have a strong IP position for these peptides and their use. This agreement terminated by its terms in June 2012. Under this agreement, we may be obligated to make product development milestone payments of up to &#8364;275,000 in the aggregate for each product developed under this research agreement if certain milestones are met. To date, we have not made, and are not under any current obligation to make, any such milestone payments, as the conditions that would trigger any such milestone payment obligations have not been satisfied. In addition, upon the first commercial sale of a product, we are required to pay an advance of 0.25&#8364; million against which future royalties will be credited. The percentage royalty payment required to be made by us to the University of Helsinki is a percentage of gross revenues derived from work performed under the Helsinki Agreement in the low single digits.

&#160;

Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access external technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled 146 issued or allowed patents, and approximately 98 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, to protect our proprietary nucleic acid-based drug discovery capabilities. Our patent portfolio, as of December 31, 2015, consisted of the following:

The patents listed in the table above will expire generally between 2019 and 2032, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates that would extend the terms of the patents in countries where such extensions may become available.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are a number of small, mid-sized and large biotechnology companies that compete with us with respect to our historical business. Universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors. Our competition is typically focused on a single nucleic acid mechanism of action, i.e. RNAi or mRNA translational inhibition or exon skipping or miRNA replacement therapy. Some of these companies only have a proprietary position around either chemistry or delivery and in fewer cases, their proprietary position arises from their belief that they can patent biology, i.e. miRNA targets. We believe we are the only company in the position of having proprietary chemistry and delivery technologies sufficient to pursue multiple nucleic acid mechanisms of action, i.e. RNAi and mRNA translational inhibition and exon skipping and miRNA replacement therapy. Such single mechanism of action competitors include: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Arcturus, Benitec Biopharma, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Isis Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Isis&#8221;), miRagen Therapeutics, Mirna, PhaseRx Pharmaceuticals, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Regulus Therapeutics, RXi Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics (&#8220;Sarepta&#8221;) and Silence Therapeutics.

&#160;

Several companies have clinical stage programs with the majority in an orphan disease indication. In particular, Isis has an early stage clinical program in DM1 and Sarepta has a late stage clinical program in DMD.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

&#160; Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates (including those for human use that may be developed by our partners based on our licensed technologies) are expected to be regulated as drug products.

&#160;

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before our drug products are marketed they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a novel drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review and finally (6) approval of an NDA.

&#160;

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. Our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010.

&#160;

In addition, regardless of the type of approval, we and our partners are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval. For example, we and our partners are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.

&#160; 

Product Liability 

&#160;

We currently do not carry product liability insurance as no patients are currently being treated with our products. We may renew our product liability insurance portfolio if patient access to our products is resumed.

Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

Our research and development activities have involved the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements. At this time, we are not conducting any R&#38;D activities that require compliance with federal, state or local laws.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, our CEO is our only full-time employee. We have also been utilizing approximately five consultants, the majority of whom previously were either employees of or consultants to our company, to support our on-going operations. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
