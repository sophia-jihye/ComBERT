BUSINESS 

OUR COMPANY 

TrueBlue, Inc. (&#8220;TrueBlue,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221;) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions, helping clients improve growth and performance by providing contingent staffing and recruitment of permanent employee solutions. Our workforce solutions meet clients&#8217; needs for a reliable, efficient workforce in a wide variety of industries. Through our workforce solutions, we help approximately 130,000 &#32;businesses to be more productive and we connect as many as 750,000 &#32;people with work each year. We are headquartered in Tacoma, Washington. 

We began operations in 1989, specializing in on-demand, general labor staffing services with the objective of providing customers with talent and flexible workforce solutions to enhance the performance of their business. We expanded our on-demand, general labor staffing services through organic geographic expansion throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Commencing in 2004, we began expanding through acquisitions to provide a full range of blue-collar staffing solutions and to help our customers be more productive with a reliable contingent labor workforce and rapidly respond to changing business needs. 

Effective June 30, 2014, we acquired Staffing Solutions Holdings, Inc. ("Seaton"), which added a full service line of on-premise contingent blue-collar staffing, complementary outsourced service offerings in management of contingent labor services providers ("MSP"), and permanent employment recruitment process outsourcing ("RPO"). On-premise staffing is large scale sourcing, screening, recruiting, and management of the contingent labor workforce at a customer's facility in order to achieve faster hiring, lower total cost of workforce, increased safety and compliance, improved retention, greater volume flexibility, and enhanced strategic decision making through robust reporting and analytics. MSP solutions provide customers with improved quality and spend management of their contingent labor vendors. RPO is high-volume sourcing, screening, and recruiting of permanent employees for all major industries and jobs. The addition of Seaton expanded our services and capabilities to better meet our objective of providing customers with talent and flexible workforce solutions they need to enhance business performance. 

We have expanded our on-premise staffing and recruitment process outsourcing capabilities with two additional acquisitions. Effective December 1, 2015 , we acquired SIMOS Insourcing Solutions (&#8220;SIMOS&#8221;), a leading provider of on-premise workforce management solutions. SIMOS clients include Fortune 500 companies in consumer goods, retail, online commerce, and food packaging and distribution. SIMOS specializes in helping clients streamline warehouse/distribution operations to meet the growing demand for online commerce and supply chain solutions. They are also experts in providing scalable solutions for pick and pack, and shipping requirements. Their unique productivity model incorporates fixed price-per-unit solutions to drive client value. Additionally, their continuous analysis and improvement of processes and incentive pay drives workforce efficiency, reduces costs, lowers risk of injury and damage, and improves productivity and service levels. SIMOS broadens our on-premise staffing footprint with an additional 37 sites across 11 states.

Effective January 4, 2016, we acquired Aon Hewitt&#8217;s RPO business, a leading provider of RPO services. Aon Hewitt's RPO clients include Fortune 500 companies primarily in the hospitality, banking, industrial, retail, and service industries. This business specializes in the sourcing, screening, and recruitment of permanent employees for various industries and positions. Their service delivery teams work as an integral partner with customers in providing talent acquisition services from sourcing candidates through hiring employees. Their service delivery teams leverage RPO administrative services based in India. Their integrated solution is highly scalable and flexible, which allows for the cost effective outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across a series of recruitment processes. The Aon Hewitt RPO global operations will be integrated into PeopleScout, our existing RPO operations, in 2016. This acquisition advances the PeopleScout strategy to become the leading global RPO provider. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We operate as two reportable segments: Staffing Services and Managed Services. 

Financial information regarding our reportable segments is included in Note 18: &#32;Segment Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Staffing Services 

Staffing Services provides a wide range of blue-collar staffing services including general labor, light industrial, skilled trades, 

aviation and transportation mechanics and technicians, and drivers as well as on-premise staffing and management of a facility's contingent blue-collar workforce. 

Staffing Services helped approximately 130,000 &#32;businesses in 2015 &#32;to be more productive by providing easy access to dependable blue-collar contingent labor and workforce solutions. Through our Staffing Services, we connect over 500,000 &#32;people with work each year. We service a broad range of industries that include construction, energy, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, waste, wholesale, retail, transportation, aviation, hospitality, and many more. We have a network of 698 &#32;branches across all 50 &#32;states, Puerto Rico, and Canada, as well as 206 &#32;on-premise locations at customers' facilities. 

We use distinct brands to market our specialized blue-collar staffing services. We operate as: 

&#8226; 

Labor Ready for on-demand, general labor; 

&#8226; 

Spartan Staffing for skilled manufacturing, assembly, and logistics labor; 

&#8226; 

CLP Resources for skilled trades for commercial, industrial, and energy construction as well as building and plant maintenance; 

&#8226; 

PlaneTechs for skilled mechanics and technicians for the aviation and transportation industries; 

&#8226; 

Centerline Drivers for temporary and dedicated drivers for the transportation and distribution industries; and 

&#8226; 

Staff Management | SMX ("Staff Management") for on-premise staffing and management of a facility's contingent workforce for manufacturing, assembly, and logistics. Newly acquired SIMOS will expand our on-premise contingent workforce staffing and management operations for warehousing and distribution. 

Our Staffing Services are in the blue-collar staffing segment of the staffing industry and have the following similar characteristics: 

&#8226; 

Provide blue-collar contingent labor services to our customers; 

&#8226; 

Build a contingent workforce through recruiting, screening, and on-boarding using a broad network of local branch locations, customer on-premise locations, and national service centers; 

&#8226; 

Assign contingent workers to customers' work sites and facilities where they ultimately work under the supervision of our customers; 

&#8226; 

Drive profitability by managing the bill rates to our customers and the pay rates to our workers. Profitable growth requires increased volume, bill rates that grow faster than pay rates, and/or leveraging our cost structure; 

&#8226; 

Utilize centralized support services to serve our customers; and 

&#8226; 

Use innovative technology to improve our ability to recruit quality workers, effectively match workers to the needs of our customers, manage our contingent workforce, and meet our customers' needs to efficiently and effectively improve productivity. 

Page - 4 

Our long-term financial performance expectations of all our staffing service lines are similar as are the underlying financial and economic metrics used to manage those service lines. Profitable growth is driven by leveraging across all service lines our investment in technology to source, recruit, and connect workers with customers; our investments in technology that improve our productivity; and our cost structure to achieve economies of scale.We are focused on continuous analysis and improvement of our processes to enhance the ease and effectiveness of doing business with us for both our customers and workers. 

Staffing Industry 

The staffing industry supplies contingent worker services to minimize the cost and effort of hiring and managing permanent employees. This allows for rapid response to changes in business conditions through the ability to temporarily replace absent employees, temporarily fill new positions, and convert fixed or permanent labor costs to variable costs. Staffing companies act as intermediaries in matching available contingent workers to employer work assignments. The work assignments vary widely in duration, level of skill, and required experience. The staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with many competing companies. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Staffing companies compete both to recruit and retain a supply of contingent workers and to attract and retain customers who will employ these workers. Customer demand for contingent staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and workforce flexibility trends. The staffing industry is subject to volatility based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the number of companies providing contingent labor services has increased due to low barriers to entry whereas during recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies, or other events. The staffing industry is currently experiencing increased demand in relation to total job growth as demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs and respond to rapidly changing market conditions. 

Managed Services 

Managed Services includes outsourced service offerings in permanent employment recruitment process outsourcing ("RPO") and management of contingent labor services providers ("MSP"). 

PeopleScout provides RPO solutions. RPO is high-volume sourcing, screening, and recruitment of permanent employees for all major industries and jobs. The RPO solution delivers improved talent quality, faster hiring, increased scalability, reduced turnover, lower cost of recruitment, greater flexibility, and increased compliance. We leverage our proprietary candidate applicant tracking systems, along with dedicated service delivery teams to work as an integrated partner with our customers in providing end-to-end talent acquisition services from sourcing candidates through on-boarding employees. The solution is highly scalable and flexible, allowing for outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across a series of recruitment process and on-boarding steps. Customer contracts are generally multi-year in duration and pricing is typically composed of a fee for each hire. Volume, job type, degree of recruiting difficulty, and number of recruiting process steps from sourcing to on-boarding factor into pricing. 

Our North American RPO services are delivered through our highly centralized operations in Chicago, Illinois together with customer on-site and virtual employee teams. The same is true for our Asia Pacific RPO services, which are centralized in Sydney, Australia. In 2015 , PeopleScout placed over 250,000 &#32;individuals into permanent jobs with 60 customers. Our commitment to superior customer service is key to our high customer retention. 

Effective January 4, 2016, we acquired Aon Hewitt&#8217;s RPO business, a leading provider of RPO services to meet their client&#8217;s permanent recruiting needs. The acquired operations expand and complement the PeopleScout operations. This acquisition further positions PeopleScout as a leading global RPO provider. PeopleScout&#8217;s global headquarters remain in Chicago, Illinois, with Asia Pacific headquarters in Sydney, Australia and global RPO administrative process services in New Delhi, India. 

Managed Services also includes our MSP service, which manages our customer's overall contingent labor program including vendor selection, vendor performance management, vendor compliance monitoring and risk management, and reducing vendor costs. As the customer's exclusive MSP service provider, we manage multiple workforce vendors utilizing vendor management systems. 

Human Resource Outsourcing Industry 

The human resource outsourcing industry involves transitioning various functions handled by internal human resources and labor procurement to outside service providers on a permanent or selective basis. Human resource outsourcing companies allow customers to shed non-core activities in order to reduce costs, free up management time and energy, and gain access to the high-quality services of specialty providers. Human resource departments are continually faced with increased operational complexity, heightened regulatory requirements and pressure to achieve cost savings, which increase the need to migrate non-core functions to outsourced providers. RPO and MSP services are in the early stages of their adoption cycles, and therefore, we believe they have significant growth potential. 

Page - 5 

Key trends contributing to RPO growth are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Cost: The majority of customers are able to reduce costs associated with their internal human resource cost structure by deploying an RPO solution for some or all of their recruiting needs. Companies are increasingly viewing RPO as an attractive and cost effective alternative to contingent search firms. 

&#8226; 

Scalability: RPO providers can add significant scalability to a company's recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal, irregular, and burst hiring without being overstaffed during less busy periods. Providers also help customers increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees. 

&#8226; 

Access to Talent: &#32;RPO programs can access numerous sources to prospect for the best talent more quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the customer. RPO solutions are typically able to source higher quality candidates well suited to the position, leading to a lower turnover rate. RPO offers technology-enabled recruiting to address the rapidly changing employment demographics, shortage of skilled professional workers, and dynamic changes to how workers connect to work opportunities. 

Key trends contributing to MSP growth are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Vendor Consolidation: &#32;As an organization's spend on contingent workforces rises, it becomes increasingly interested in reducing the administrative burden of managing multiple outside vendors, having consistency among contractors and processes, and maintaining robust performance tracking and analytics. 

&#8226; 

Access to Talent: &#32;An MSP solution allows a company access to a large variety of vendors with the efficiency of working with one supplier. An MSP can access numerous vendors to find the best talent at the best price more quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the customer. 

&#8226; 

Cost Savings : Vendor consolidation can achieve significant efficiencies through enhanced scale and cost advantages such as single point of contact, standardized contracts, and consolidated invoicing and reporting. MSP programs achieve cost savings through economies of scale with suppliers that would not be obtainable otherwise. 

&#8226; 

Compliance Pressure : Demand for contingent employee sourcing and workforce management solutions is driven by increasing work eligibility legislation, and compliance monitoring to ensure correct worker classification in order to properly address tax withholding, overtime, Social Security, unemployment, and healthcare obligations to avoid government penalties and lawsuits. Our MSP solution addresses these needs. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Market leadership through organic growth of our specialized workforce solutions. 

Our customers have a variety of challenges in running their businesses, many of which are unique to the industry in which they operate, their competitive pressures, and business performance. We are industry leaders dedicated to tailoring staffing solutions that meet the unique needs of our customers and the industries in which they operate. We offer differentiated solutions that meet our customers needs and keep pace with their changing needs as follows: 

&#8226; 

The addition of Seaton and the expansion of our services with the acquisition of the SIMOS on-premise workforce management solutions and the Aon Hewitt RPO services added new services and capabilities to better meet our objective of providing customers with the talent and flexible workforce solutions they need to enhance business performance. 

&#8226; 

We remain committed to building the specialization of our sales, recruiting, and service teams, while creating a more seamless experience for our customers to access all of our services with more comprehensive solutions to enhance their performance and our growth. Our service lines offer complementary workforce solutions with unique value propositions to meet our customers' demand for talent. 

&#8226; 

We remain committed to advancing the use of mobile technology in sourcing and connecting talent to customers and meeting their need for both contingent and permanent employee workforce solutions. We expect that mobile technology and digitizing our business model will differentiate us from the competition and allow us to provide greater access to high-quality talent, connect that talent with our customers, and meet our customers' needs for both contingent workers and permanent employees. It will also lower the cost of our delivery model. 

&#8226; 

As the economy grows, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence for staffing services. All of our multi-location service lines have opportunities to expand their geographical reach through new physical 

Page - 6 

locations, expanded use of existing locations to provide the full range of blue-collar staffing services, centralized recruitment, and dispatch of our contingent workers to areas without branches. 

&#8226; 

Our MSP solution is focused on domestic middle market companies with a growing dependence on contingent labor. We are uniquely positioned to supply blue-collar contingent workers to our customers and with our MSP solution to manage the full range of their contingent labor needs. 

&#8226; 

We are recognized as an industry leader for RPO services. RPO services are in the early stages of their adoption cycle and therefore we believe they have significant growth potential. The success of early adopters is generating greater opportunity to expand our service offering. We have a differentiated service that leverages innovative technology for high-volume sourcing and dedicated client service teams for connecting people to opportunities. We have a track record of helping our customers reduce the cost of hiring, adding significant scalability to recruiting and hiring, and accessing numerous sources to prospect for the best talent quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the customer. Companies are facing rapidly changing employment demographics, shortage of talent, and dynamic changes to how people connect to work opportunities. Our solution addresses these growing challenges. Global companies are looking for global solutions. The addition of the Aon Hewitt RPO services will accelerate our global expansion of RPO services. 

Leverage technology to improve the contingent worker and customer experience and our efficiency. 

We are committed to technology innovation that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us and easier to connect workers to work opportunities. We are making significant investments in online and mobile applications to improve the access, speed, and ease of connecting our customers and workers. We will continue to invest in technology that increases our sustainability, scalability, and agility. These investments improve the efficiency and effectiveness of delivering our service. We expect to be the service leader, and we believe that the combination of our technology in the hands of our dedicated service teams differentiates our service. 

Growth through expansion into complementary workforce services. 

Our customers utilize our workforce solutions to improve the performance of their businesses. With growing demand for improved productivity and connecting to workers, our customers are looking for a full range of services. We are well positioned to offer additional complementary human capital solutions to help our customers achieve further optimization of their workforce. We expect to leverage our access to workers, innovative technology, and customer relationships to offer tailored solutions that expand our core services, offer greater access to talent and talent acquisition. 

Growth through acquisitions, which enhance our organic growth and technology advances. 

Strategic acquisitions continue to be a key growth strategy. We believe we have a core competence in assessing, valuing, and integrating acquisitions culminating in higher shareholder returns. We are excited about the future of the staffing industry and human resource outsourcing and believe we can continue to create shareholder value through acquisitions, which expand our workforce solutions in high-growth markets, enhance our use of technology to better serve our customers, and increase our own efficiency. 

CUSTOMERS 

Our customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 100 companies. 

During 2015 , we served approximately 130,000 &#32;customers in industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, waste, wholesale, retail, transportation, aviation, hospitality, and many more. Our ten largest customers accounted for 25.5% &#32;of total revenue for 2015 , 19.4% &#32;for 2014 , and 15.7% &#32;for 2013 . 

For the fiscal year ended 2015 , one customer, Amazon, represented 13.1% &#32;and 13.7% &#32;of total Company and the Staffing Services reportable segment revenues, respectively. For the fiscal year ended 2015 , two customers represented 10.6% &#32;and 10.2% &#32;of our Managed Services reportable segment revenue, respectively. 

For the fiscal years ended 2014 &#32;and 2013 , no single customer represented more than 10% &#32;of total Company or the reported segment revenues. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 25, 2015 , we employed approximately 5,500 &#32;full-time equivalent employees.

CONTINGENT WORKERS 

Our Staffing Services placed over 500,000 &#32;contingent workers on assignments with our customers during 2015. We recruit contingent workers daily so that we can be responsive to the planned, as well as unplanned, needs of the customers we serve. We attract our pool of contingent workers through online resources, extensive internal databases, advertising, job fairs, and various other methods. We identify the skills, knowledge, abilities, and personal characteristics of a contingent worker and match their competencies and capabilities to a customer&#8217;s requirements. This enables our customers to obtain immediate value by placing a highly productive employee on the job site. We use a variety of proprietary programs and methods for identifying and assessing the skill level of our contingent workers when selecting a particular individual for a specific assignment and retaining those workers for future assignments. We believe that our programs and methods enable us to offer a higher quality of service by increasing productivity, decreasing turnover, and reducing absenteeism. 

We provide a bridge to permanent, full-time employment for thousands of contingent workers each year. Workers also come to us because of the flexibility we offer to fill a short-term financial need and/or provide longer-term contingent labor opportunities. Workers may be assigned to different jobs and job sites, and their assignments could last for as little as a few hours or extend for several weeks or months. We provide our workers meaningful work and the opportunity to improve their skills. We are considered the legal employer of our workers, and laws regulating the employment relationship are applicable to our operations. We consider our relations with our contingent workers to be good. 

COMPETITION 

Staffing Services 

The strongest staffing services competitor in a particular market is a company with established relationships and a track record of meeting the customer's needs. We compete with other large publicly-held staffing companies as well as privately-owned staffing companies on a national, regional, and local level. We also experience competition from internet-based companies providing a variety of flexible workforce solutions. Competition exists in attracting customers as well as qualified contingent workers for our customers. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Competitive forces have historically limited our ability to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset increased costs of doing business, some of which include increased contingent worker wages, costs for workers&#8217; compensation, unemployment insurance, and health care. 

The most significant competitive factors are price, ability to promptly fill customer orders, success in meeting customers&#8217; expectations of recruiting contingent workers, and appropriately addressing customer service issues. We believe we derive a competitive advantage from our service history, and our specialized approach in serving the industries of our customers. Our national presence, industry specialization, investment in technology and proprietary systems, and processes together with specialized programs focused on worker safety, risk management, and legal and regulatory compliance are key differentiators from many of our competitors. 

Managed Services 

The strongest competitors are companies specializing in RPO services and business services companies that also offer RPO services. No one provider dominates the market. Competition also includes internal human resource departments that have not or are not considering outsourcing. The most significant competitive factors for RPO services are the ability to reduce customer cost by deploying an RPO solution and reducing the internal human resource cost structure of our customers. The ability to add significant scalability to a customer's recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal and irregular hiring; the ability to increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees; and the ability to source the most attractive talent at the best price are all important. Our tailored solutions, customer partnership, proprietary technology, and service delivery are key differentiators from many of our competitors. 

MSPs generally compete with internal contingent labor procurement, companies specializing in MSP services, and business services companies that also offer MSP services. The most significant competitive factors for outsourcing MSP services are vendor consolidation, compliance pressure, cost savings, access to diverse talent pools, and sophisticated deployment and monitoring. 

CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS 

The workforce solutions business has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Customers tend to use contingent workers to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire permanent workers when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow. Conversely, our revenues also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken and thus temporary staff positions are eliminated, permanent hiring is frozen, and turnover replacement diminishes. 

Page - 8 

SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS 

Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations for staffing services. Demand is lower during the first and second quarters, in part due to limitations to outside work during the winter months and slowdown in manufacturing and logistics after the holiday season. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by contingent worker payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers lag payroll to contingent workers, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Demand for contingent labor peaks during the third quarter for outdoor work and the fourth quarter for manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, distribution and logistics for the holiday season. 

REGULATION 

Our services are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. We continuously monitor legislation and regulatory changes for their potential effect on our business. We invest in technology and process improvements to implement required changes while minimizing the impact to our operating efficiency and effectiveness. Regulatory cost increases are passed through to our customers to the fullest extent possible. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

We have developed an integrated risk management program that focuses on loss analysis, education, and improvement programs to reduce our operational costs and risk exposure. We regularly analyze our losses on labor matters and workers' compensation claims to identify trends. This allows us to focus our resources on those areas that may have the greatest impact on us, price our services appropriately, and adjust our sales and operational approach in these areas. We have also developed educational materials for distribution to our customers and workers to address specific safety risks unique to their industry.
