Overview 

&#160;

Monaker Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been amassing vacation home inventory in efforts to become one of the world&#8217;s largest online marketplaces for the alternative lodging rental industry. Alternative lodging rentals (ALRs) are whole unit vacation homes or timeshare resort units that are fully furnished, privately owned residential properties, including homes, condominiums, villas and cabins, that property owners and managers rent to the public on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Our marketplace, NextTrip.com, has the capacity of uniting millions of travelers seeking ALR online with property owners and managers of over one million vacation rental properties located in over 120 countries around the world. As of February 29, 2016, we operated our online marketplace through 115 websites in 16 languages, with leading websites in Europe, Asia, South America and the United States. As of February 29, 2016, our global marketplace included approximately 100,000 paid listings on subscriptions and contracted with over 1.1 million listings under the performance based listing arrangement ALRs (described in greater detail below). As an added feature to our ALR offering, we also provide activities and tours at the destinations that are catered to the traveler through our Maupintour products.

&#160;

Our ambition is to become the largest vacation rental platform in the world with auxiliary services so travelers can purchase vacations through one site; NextTrip.com (or through other online distributors sourced by NextTrip.com) and to provide the most qualified inquiries and bookings to property owners and managers. NextTrip serves three major constituents: property owners and managers, travelers and other distributors. Property owners and managers pay to provide detailed listings of their properties on our websites with the goal of reaching a broad audience of travelers seeking ALRs. Listing fees paid by property owners and managers are paid either in the form of subscriptions that are generally for an annual period, or in the form of performance-based fees that allow for owners and managers to list their properties for free and pay us a commission for successful bookings; this allows owners and managers to list their property on NextTrip and pay a commission per booking in lieu of a pre-paid subscription fee. Currently we are converting owners and managers away from the subscription format into the performance-based format. This is transparent to the traveler yet more beneficial to the owners and managers as they accept a larger performance-based fee in return for relief from the up-front subscription fee and lower booking fee. Travelers visit NextTrip and are able to search and compare our large and detailed inventory of listings to find ALRs meeting their needs.

&#160; 

The global vacation rental industry is large and growing, but also fragmented and inefficient. We believe we will benefit from having both a broad selection of ALR listings and a large audience of travelers as well as distributors. We believe that the broad selection of ALRs will attract more travelers and the large audience of travelers will in turn attract more ALRs from property owners and managers.

&#160;

Monaker is a technology driven travel and logistics company with alternative lodging rental inventory. Monaker&#8217;s inventory consists of ALRs owned and leased by third parties which are available to rent through Monaker&#8217;s websites. Core to the Company&#8217;s services are key elements including technology, an extensive film library, media distribution, trusted brands and established partnerships that enhance product offerings and reach. We believe that consumers are quickly adopting video for researching and educating themselves prior to purchases, and Monaker has carefully amassed video content, media distribution, key industry relationships and a prestigious Travel Brand as cornerstones for the development and planned deployment of core-technology on both proprietary and partnership platforms.

Summary 

&#160;

Monaker sells travel services to leisure and corporate customers around the world. The primary focus is on providing ALR options as well as providing schedule, pricing and availability information for booking reservations for airlines, hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel products such as sightseeing tours, show and event tickets and theme park passes. The Company sells these travel services both individually and as components of dynamically-assembled packaged travel vacations and trips. In addition, the Company provides content that presents travelers with information about travel destinations, maps and other travel details; this content information is the product of proprietary video-centered technology that allows the Company to create targeted travel videos from its film libraries. In January 2016, the Company introduced a beta of its new Travel Platform under the NextTrip brand. This platform is still under development and continues to be improved with a focus on maximizing the consumer&#8217;s experience and assisting them in the decision and purchasing process.

&#160;

The platform is a combination of proprietary and licensed technology (described below) that connects and searches large travel suppliers as well as perishing and alternative lodging inventories to present to consumers comprehensive and optimal alternatives at the most inexpensive rates to choose from.

&#160;

The Company sells its travel services through various distribution channels. The primary distribution channel is through its own websites at Nexttrip.com and Maupintour.com. The second distribution channel is selling travel services to customers through a toll-free telephone number designed to assist customers with complex or high-priced offerings. The remaining distribution channels are in the final stages of deployment and include sales on other travel companies&#8217; websites and sales through networks of third-party travel agents and travel portals.

&#160;

Monaker&#8217;s core holdings include Nexttrip.com, and Maupintour.com along with platforms for vacation home rentals, timeshare rentals and discount travel. Nexttrip.com is the primary website, where travel services are booked. The travel services include, but are not limited to: ALR, tours, activities/attractions, air, hotel and car rentals. Maupintour feeds into Nextrip.com by providing high-end tour packages and activities/attractions.

&#160;

Additional holdings include a social media/discount travel platform, a 51% interest in Name Your Fee, LLC (which was sold in May 2016) and a 28% interest in RealBiz Media Group, Inc. (&#8220;RealBiz&#8221;) which was deconsolidated on October 31, 2014 and written off as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 as an unrealizable investment.

&#160;

The Company owned approximately 28% of RealBiz Media Group, Inc. (RealBiz) as of February 29, 2016 which is represented by 44,470,101 shares of RealBiz Series A Preferred Stock shares and 10,359,890 shares of RealBiz common stock. In addition, the Company is owed in excess of $5.8 million in funds as a net receivable balance due from RealBiz for amounts paid for the benefit of or on behalf of RealBiz. Both the shares and the net receivable have been written down to zero ($0) to reflect the realizable value of this investment and asset. On May 11, 2016, RealBiz filed a Complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case Number 1:16-cv-61017-FAM)(the &#8220;Complaint&#8221;). The Complaint alleges $1,287,517 is due from us to RealBiz, and seeks the recovery of such amount, plus pre-judgment interest from October 31, 2015 and costs. The Complaint alleges causes of action including &#8216;account stated&#8217; and &#8216;unjust enrichment&#8217;. In June 2016, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the Complaint (the &#8220;Counterclaim&#8221;) denying RealBiz&#8217;s allegations and claims and pleading affirmative defenses including &#8216;failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted&#8217;, &#8216;set-off rights (including that the amount owed by RealBiz to us far exceeds the $1.2 million amount that RealBiz alleges is due to it), &#8216;mistake or error&#8217;, &#8216;unclean hands&#8217;, &#8216;failure to state a claim&#8217;, &#8216;waiver&#8217;, &#8216;release&#8217;, &#8216;breach of contract&#8217; and &#8216;rescission of letter addressing partial balance due&#8217; (confirming that a letter upon which RealBiz&#8217;s case is predicated was rescinded shortly after its issuance and is of no force or effect). The Counterclaim seeks attorney&#8217;s fees and costs. The Counterclaim also alleges counterclaims against RealBiz for causes of action including &#8216;unjust enrichment&#8217; (we allege that the net amount due to us from RealBiz is between $5.8 million to $11.1 million dollars), &#8216;money had and received&#8217;, &#8216;business disparagement&#8217;, and &#8216;breach of contract&#8217;, and seeks recovery of all actual damages, consequential damages and incidental damages, if any, including but not limited to attorney&#8217;s fees and costs, plus-prejudgment and post-judgment interest as well as the full amount owed by RealBiz. RealBiz has not yet answered or otherwise responded to the Counterclaim. We believe the claims asserted in the Complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the lawsuit while simultaneously seeking to recover amounts we are owed.

&#160;

&#160;

On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Jasper&#8221;) and created a Florida limited liability company named Name Your Fee, LLC. On May 15, 2015, as required, the Company issued 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to Jasper at a stated value of $5 per share for a total value of $500,000. As stated in the agreement, Monaker received a 51% capital interest and Jasper received a 49% capital interest of the outstanding equity of Name Your Fee, LLC. Additionally, Jasper contributed $75,000 in proceeds as part of the agreement. The Company properly eliminated the value of the investment in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. On May 16, 2016, the Company entered in to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement for the sale of its 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC in exchange for a Promissory Note, maturing on June 15, 2018, in the amount of $750,000 plus the cancellation of $45,000 in existing promissory notes due from the purchaser. The Promissory Note does not accrue interest, is secured by the 51% membership interest in Name Your Fee, LLC and will be repaid through 20% of the net earnings received in NameYourFee.com through maturity. The Note contains standard and customary events of default. The principal amount of note is due on June 15, 2018, provided that it will not be an event of default under the note unless the note is not repaid within 60 days after such maturity date (i.e., by August 14, 2018).

Products and Services 

&#160;

Monaker&#8217;s main focus is marketing alternative lodging rental (ALR) options directly to consumers and to other travel distributors. The Company&#8217;s concentration on ALRs is driven by contracts with over a million vacation home unit owners and managers as well as owners, developers and managers of timeshare resort units that are made available to consumers and other travel portals (distributors) for nightly or extended stays. In addition, we augment our product offering to travelers by arranging for activities and tours through our subsidiary website Maupintour. Therefore, not only is a traveler identifying a destination and the lodging at the destination but we can provide options of activities to engage in while at the destination. Lastly, we provide the means for making arrangements for the air tickets and car rentals if desired and, if the traveler does not subscribe to the ALR accommodations, hotel rooms can also be selected. Therefore, Monaker, through NextTrip, offers travelers the complete travel package made easy or&#8230; Travel Made Easy TM

Products and Services For Property Owners And Managers 

&#160;

Paid Listings .

&#160;

Paid listings are an advertisement for a property paid via subscription or on a performance basis and displayed on one or more websites. Although listings may be displayed on multiple sites, a paid listing is counted only one time on its native language NextTrip brand, the website from which the listing originated.

&#160;

Subscription-based Listings. 

&#160;

Subscription-based listings account for approximately 10% of our product offerings and are purchased in advance by property owners or managers as a form of advertising to promote their vacation rentals to prospective travelers on one or more of our websites, typically for one year. On our websites that offer tiered pricing to our property owners and managers, we generally offer four pricing levels &#8211; bronze, silver, gold or platinum. Property owners and managers can pay for higher search results placement by purchasing a higher subscription level or tier; however, the results may also be sorted by the traveler based on location, type of property, size or other criteria.

&#160;

Performance-based listings. 

&#160; 

Performance-based listings allow property owners and managers to list a property with no initial upfront fees and instead pay commissions on traveler bookings generated on our websites.

&#160;

Each listing includes a set of tools for the property owner or manager which enables them to manage an availability calendar, reservations, inquiries and the content of the listing. These tools allow the property owner or manager to create the listing by uploading photographs, text descriptions or lists of amenities, a map showing the location of the property, and property availability, all of which can be updated throughout the term of the listing. Each listing provides travelers the ability to use email or other methods to contact property owners and managers.

&#160;

The listings include tools and services to help property owners and managers run their vacation rental businesses more efficiently such as to responding to and manage inquiries, preparing and sending rental quotes and payment invoices, allowing travelers to book online, including being able to enter into rental agreements with travelers online, and processing online payments. Property owners and managers that elect to process online payments are subject to a transaction fee.

&#160; 

Third-Party Services. Through third parties, we offer property owners and managers several ancillary products and services. These products and services include credit card merchant processing and insurance products which are integrated into our property owner and manager tools.

&#160; 

Redistribution of Listings. We make selected, online bookable properties available to online travel agencies as well as channel partners. These properties have a paid listing on one of our websites. We are compensated in various ways for these services including receiving a percentage of the transaction value, charging a fee to the property owner or manager for making this inventory available to these partners, or charging a fee to the channel partner.

Products and Services for Travelers 

&#160; 

Search Tools and Ability to Compare . Our online marketplace NextTrip provides travelers with tools to search for and filter vacation rentals based on various criteria, such as location, type of property, number of bedrooms, amenities, price, availability or keywords.

&#160; 

Traveler Login. Travelers are able to create accounts on certain NextTrip websites that enable them to send inquiries to property owners and managers without having to fill in their information for each inquiry. They can also benefit from other features such as the ability to save lists of favorite properties and send them to family and friends.

&#160; 

Security. We use a combination of technology and human review to evaluate the content of listings and to screen for inaccuracies or fraud with the goal of providing only accurate and trustworthy information to travelers. Travelers who find and book a property listed on our websites may register their trips to qualify for fraud protection under our Free $1,000 Traveler Protection which provides them with financial protection in certain circumstances up to certain limits. Additionally, we provide a secure method of communication through our websites whereby communication between owners or property managers and the travelers who want to inquire about or book their properties occurs in a secure, authenticated environment on the NextTrip system rather than a third-party email platform.

&#160;

Reviews and Ratings. Travelers are invited to submit online reviews of the vacation rentals they have rented through our websites. These reviews are intended to convey the accuracy of the listing information found on our websites.

&#160;

Communication. Travelers who have made at least one inquiry on our websites receive regular communications, including notices about places of interest, special offers, new listings, and an email newsletter. The newsletter is available to any traveler who agrees to receive it and offers introductions to new destinations and vacation rentals, as well as tips and useful information when staying in vacation rentals.

&#160;

Mobile Websites and Applications. We provide versions of our websites formatted for web browsers on smartphones and tablets so that property owners, managers and travelers can access our websites and tools from mobile devices.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market to provide listing, searching and marketing services whether they are alternative lodging rental (ALR), activities and tours, air bookings, car rentals or hotel stays is highly competitive and fragmented with limited barriers to entry. Each of the services we provide to property owners, managers and travelers is currently offered by competitors. Furthermore, ALRs are not typically marketed exclusively through any single channel, and many of our listing agreements are not exclusive, potentially allowing our competitors to aggregate a set of listings similar to ours. We believe we compete primarily on the basis of the quantity, quality, and nature of the properties offered on our websites. The majority of properties offered in our marketplace reflect a whole house or property rather than a room. In addition, we benefit from the quality of the direct relationships we have with property owners and managers, the number of inquiries provided to our property owners and managers, the global diversity of the ALRs available on our websites, the quality of our websites, the tools provided to our property owners and managers, customer service, brand identity, the success of our marketing programs and price.

&#160;

Our principal competitors include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; other vacation and short-term rental listing websites, such as TripAdvisor.com, HomeAway.com and Airbnb.com; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; websites that list both rooms to rent as well as ALRs, such as Airbnb.com, HomeAway.com, Wimdu.com and HouseTrip.com; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; professional property managers who charge a percentage of booking revenue for their services, such as Wyndam Worldwide Corp. and InterHome, AG; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; hotels that offer larger rooms and amenities common in ALRs, such as Hyatt Vacation Clubs and Four Seasons Resorts; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; websites that aggregate listings from property managers who advertise and take bookings on behalf of property managers, such as VacationRoost and Perfect Places, Inc. in the United States and Atraveo and eDomizil in Europe; &#160;

5 Page &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; online travel websites, such as those operated by Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Kayak.com, Booking.com, Orbitz.com, Priceline.com and Travelocity.com, have traditionally provided comprehensive travel services and may expand or are now expanding into the ALR category; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; timeshare exchange companies, such as Interval International, Inc. and RCI, LLC; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; large Internet companies, such as craigslist, Inc., eBay Inc., Google Inc., MSN.com and Yahoo!, which provide vacation rental listing or search services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; offline publishers of classified vacation rental listings, including regional newspapers and travel-related magazines. &#160;

For a discussion of the risks attendant to the highly competitive nature of our market, see the information under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below under the caption &#8220;The market in which we participate is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.&#8221;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Property owners and managers tend to buy subscription listings when travelers are most likely to make vacation plans. The timing primarily depends on whether travelers are taking a winter or summer vacation and tends to vary by country. We typically have the highest level of new and renewed subscription listings in the first quarter of the year, which is typically when travelers are making plans for summer vacations in the United States and Europe. The lowest level of new subscription listings and renewals are expected in the third quarter. By the fourth quarter, we typically see property owners and managers of winter vacation destinations list and renew subscriptions in time to meet the needs of travelers planning those trips. Other vacation areas outside of the United States and Europe also have seasonality, which may not be reflected in the same quarters.

&#160;

As performance-based listings grow, the seasonality of those commission-based transactions may result in higher revenues in the summer and winter vacation months. We also expect seasonality in the number of visitors to our websites, with the first quarter having the highest number of visitors.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have developed proprietary systems architecture to create, maintain and operate our websites. This technology consists of internal development by our staff of designers, developers and engineers and software acquired or licensed from outside developers and companies. Our systems are designed to serve property owners, managers and travelers in an automated and scalable fashion. Costs associated with our research and development is included in several expenses including technology and development, salaries and benefits and in general and administrative expenses.

&#160;

Technology and Infrastructure 

&#160;

Our websites are hosted using a combination of third-party data centers distributed globally across multiple regions. Our systems architecture has been designed to manage increases in traffic on our websites through the addition of server and network hardware without making software changes. Our third-party data centers provide our online marketplace with scalable and redundant Internet connectivity and redundant power and cooling to our hosting environments. We use security methods to ensure the integrity of our networks and protection of confidential data collected and stored on our servers, and we have developed and use internal policies and procedures to protect the personal information of our property owners, managers and travelers using our websites that we collect and use as part of our normal operations. Access to our networks, and the servers and databases on which confidential data is stored, is protected by industry standard firewall technology. We test for unauthorized external access to the network daily using automated services and conduct periodic audits performed by our internal staff. Physical access to our servers and related equipment is secured by limiting access to the data center to operations personnel only. Costs associated with our web hosting operation are included in general and administrative costs.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our intellectual property includes the content of our websites, our registered domain names, our registered and unregistered trademarks, contracts with third party property managers and distributors. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our registered domain names and our technology infrastructure currently give us a competitive advantage in the online market for ALR listings and arrangements with attractions and tour operators. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also rely on copyright laws to protect the appearance and design of our sites and applications, although to date we have not registered for copyright protection on any particular content. We have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business in order to protect our proprietary interests. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and, despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites or our brand names without authorization.

The Company is actively working on creating and/or expanding several key relationships with travel suppliers to allow it to distribute its ALR offerings. Currently, travel revenues are principally generated by Maupintour. Maupintour revenue is generated from the sale of high-end escorted tours and Flexible Independent Travel (FIT) tours as well as upscale clientele seeking customized trips. The Company estimates that its target market for Maupintour represents less than 5% of all U.S. domestic leisure travelers. We believe that upscale travelers, primarily discerning &#8220;Baby Boomers,&#8221; seek travel solutions rather than pre-packaged tours, and the Company has consistently tried to cater to this niche marketplace, rather than compete on the lower end of the market.

&#160;

The travel video platform is active on Maupintour.com and the number of travel clips available is increasing by incorporating much of our travel destinations footage library as well as through content from tourism boards and key travel suppliers. Our videos platforms have calls-to-action that we plan to push across potentially millions of web and mobile devices and as brand awareness is created through this media platform, we anticipate that revenues should increase as well.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s target markets are a) those consumers that prefer a &#8220;similar to home&#8221; experience when choosing their lodging preference (i.e., vacation homes) and those that want affordable high-end resort accommodations (i.e., timeshare resort units) and, b) established distribution channels and portals that cater to those same consumers.

&#160;

Essentially, the Company has identified its target products in the alternative lodging and activities / tours niches. All remnants of its historical foray into the television media and real estate sectors have been sold or abandoned to focus exclusively on the travel sector. The Company continues to serve its existing travel clients through Maupintour and NextTrip.com.
