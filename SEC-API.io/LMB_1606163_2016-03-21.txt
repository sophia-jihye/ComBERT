 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Introductions 

&#160;

1347 Capital Corp. (&#8220;1347 Capital&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on April 15, 2014 as a blank check company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses (a &#8220;Business Combination&#8221;). At December 31, 2015, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2015 relates to the Company&#8217;s formation, the Offering described below, and search for an acquisition target.

&#160;

Company History 

&#160;

The Company consummated its initial public offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;) of 4,000,000 units (&#8220;Units&#8221;) on July 21, 2014 generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000. The Company granted the representative of the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 600,000 Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any. Simultaneously with the closing of the Offering, 1347 Capital also consummated a private placement of 180,000 units (&#8220;Private Units,&#8221;) at $10 per unit and 600,000 warrants, or &#8220;$15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants&#8221; at $0.50 per warrant generating gross proceeds of $2,100,000. In April 2014, Company&#8217;s insiders purchased an aggregate of 1,150,000 shares of common stock (the &#8220;Insider Shares),&#8221; for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.02 per share.

&#160;

On July 21, 2014 the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and on July 23, 2014 purchased an additional 600,000 Units at the Offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000. In a private sale that took place simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company&#8217;s sponsor purchased an additional 18,000 Private Units at $10.00 per unit.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

All of the proceeds received from the Offering and sale of Private Units were placed in a trust account (the &#8220;Trust Account&#8221;), with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company acting as trustee, after paying for certain expenses and working capital requirements of the Company, such that at least approximately $10.00 per Unit sold in the Offering will be held in trust until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company&#8217;s initial Business Combination and (ii) the Company&#8217;s failure to consummate a Business Combination within the prescribed time.

&#160;

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following the Offering. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Offering and the private placement of Private Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial Business Combination. Our initial Business Combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a Business Combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous Business Combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single Business Combination.

&#160;

Sources of Target Businesses 

&#160;

We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus associated with our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition to our engagement of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions or mergers in the future, in which event we may pay a finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will Kingsway Financial Services Inc (&#8220;Kingsway&#8221;), Fund Management Group LLC (&#8220;FMG&#8221;), our sponsor or any of the members of our management team be paid any finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have no present intention to enter into a Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

&#160;

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

Subject to our management team&#8217;s fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter&#8217;s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Additionally, there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial Business Combination. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; financial condition and results of operation; 

&#160; &#8226; growth potential; 

&#160; &#8226; return on equity or invested capital; 

&#160; &#8226; market capitalization or enterprise value; 

&#160; &#8226; experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 

&#160; &#8226; capital requirements; 

&#160; &#8226; competitive position; 

&#160; &#8226; barriers to entry; 

&#160; &#8226; stage of development of the products, processes or services; 

&#160; &#8226; existing distribution and potential for expansion; 

&#160; &#8226; degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 

&#160; &#8226; proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 

&#160; &#8226; impact of regulation on the business; 

&#160; &#8226; regulatory environment of the industry; 

&#160; &#8226; costs associated with effecting the business combination; 

&#160; &#8226; industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 

&#160; &#8226; macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. &#160;

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business.

&#160;

Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Fair Market Value of Target Business 

&#160;

Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter&#8217;s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, although we may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the Trust Account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a Business Combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders and are therefore required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view, we may ask that banking firm to opine on whether the target business met the 80% fair market value test. Nevertheless, we are not required to do so and could determine not to do so without consent of our stockholders.

&#160;

Stockholder Approval of Business Combination 

&#160;

In connection with any proposed Business Combination, we will seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders (but not our insiders, officers or directors) may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, subject to the limitations described herein.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. As a result, if stockholders owning approximately 89.1% or more of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering exercise conversion rights, the Business Combination will not be consummated. However, the actual percentages will only be able to be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined company (which would include the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Offering as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, less up to 30% of such fee that we may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us in identifying or consummating an initial Business Combination, any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and Business Combinations that have not been repaid at that time, as well as any other liabilities of ours and the liabilities of the target business) upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination, subject to the requirement that we must have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon closing of such business combination. As a result, the actual percentages of shares that can be converted may be significantly lower than our estimates. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial Business Combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial Business Combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Alternatively, we may not be able to consummate a Business Combination unless the number of shares of common stock seeking conversion rights is significantly less than the 89.1% indicated above. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 18 months from the closing of our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have executed a letter of intent or definitive agreement for a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but have not consummated the Business Combination within such 18-month period) in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account.

&#160;

Our insiders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed Business Combination and (2) not to convert any shares of common stock into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-Business Combination activity. None of our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or shares of common stock in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed Business Combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed Business Combination, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

&#160; 

Conversion Rights 

&#160; 

At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, will be entitled to demand that his or her shares of common stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or hers, or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed Business Combination with respect to all shares of common stock owned by him or her, or his or her affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed Business Combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder&#8217;s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in the Offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders.

&#160;

None of our insiders, officers or directors will have the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the Offering or purchased by them in the Offering or in the aftermarket.

&#160;

Liquidation if No Business Combination 

&#160;

If we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have entered into a letter of intent or definitive agreement for a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but the Business Combination has not been completed within such 18-month period), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the rights and warrants will expire, holders of rights and warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such rights and warrants, respectively, and the rights and warrants will be worthless.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a Business Combination with utilizing the net proceeds of our Offering, our ability to compete in completing a Business Combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.

&#160;

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination may delay the completion of a transaction; &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis (for instance, if the Business Combination would result in each share of common stock outstanding being exchanged for two shares of common stock, each right would result in the holder receiving two-tenths ( 2/10) of a share of common stock upon consummation of such Business Combination); &#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to pay the fee to EarlyBirdCapital for acting as an investment banker in connection with our initial Business Combination; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to either repay or issue Private Units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; our obligation to register the resale of the Insider Shares, as well as the Private Units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the impact on the target business&#8217; assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. &#160;

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial Business Combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. If we succeed in effecting our initial Business Combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial Business Combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160; 

We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 150 Pierce Road, 6th Floor, Itasca, IL 60143. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee 1347 Capital LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, charges us for general and administrative services pursuant to a letter agreement between us and 1347 Capital LLC. We believe that the fee charged by 1347 Capital LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the Business Combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to consummation of our initial Business Combination.
