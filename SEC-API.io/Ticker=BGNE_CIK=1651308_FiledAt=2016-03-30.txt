Overview 

&#160; 

We are a globally focused biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. We further believe that discovery of next-generation cancer therapies requires new research tools. To that end, we have developed a proprietary cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies in developing new models to support our drug discovery effort. Our strategy is to advance a pipeline of drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens. Over the last five years, using our cancer biology platform, we have developed clinical-stage drug candidates that inhibit the important oncology targets Bruton&#146;s tyrosine kinase, or BTK, RAF dimer protein complex and PARP family of proteins, and an immuno-oncology agent that inhibits the immune checkpoint protein receptor PD-1. Our drug candidates targeting BTK, RAF dimer and PARP have demonstrated early activity and favorable safety profiles in the dose-escalation phases of clinical trials conducted in Australia and New Zealand, and our BTK and RAF dimer drug candidates are currently in the dose-expansion phases of their respective clinical trials. Our PD-1 drug candidate is currently in the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand. As of March 25, 2016, our four clinical-stage drug candidates have been dosed in over 400 patients. We have Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, in effect for our BTK and PD-1 inhibitors with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and have received approval of our Clinical Trial Application for our RAF dimer inhibitor from the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA. Our research operations are in China, which we believe confers several advantages including access to a deep scientific talent pool and proximity to extensive preclinical study and clinical trial resources through collaborations with leading cancer hospitals in China. Beyond the substantial market opportunities we expect to have in the United States, Europe and Japan, we believe our location in China provides us the opportunity to bring best-in-class monotherapies and combination therapeutics to our home market where many global standard-of-care therapies are currently not approved or available. We have assembled a team of more than 240 individuals in China, the United States, and Australia with deep scientific talent and extensive global pharmaceutical experience who are deeply committed to advancing our mission to become a leader in next-generation cancer therapies. 

&#160; 

We believe that oncology treatment has entered an era of revolutionary change in which cancer drugs will be used both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. Due to breakthroughs in gene sequencing and methods of tumor characterization, cancer is rapidly being redefined from a paradigm of classification based on tissue of origin, such as lung, colorectal or ovarian, to one of specific molecular characteristics, such as abnormalities in HER2, BRCA, BRAF, ALK and EGFR genes and proteins. As a result, many more specific disease subpopulations can be targeted for more effective treatment than has been possible in the past. This ability to better classify cancers has allowed the development of molecularly targeted drugs that address specific cancer subpopulations and provide high response rates in tumors with particular mutations. In addition, the development of immuno-oncology agents such as antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 protein receptors and the PD-L1 protein has demonstrated the importance of the human immune system in cancer therapy and the potential for high rates of more durable responses from agents that activate the immune system to identify and eliminate tumors. We believe that the future of cancer therapy will involve combinations of molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs tailored to particular tumor sub-groups and have directed our research efforts at both types of drugs. 

&#160; 

Our belief that this fundamental shift was about to occur in cancer research led us early in our history to develop a cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary tumor biopsies in developing new models. Our proximity to leading cancer treatment centers in Beijing and our close relationships with clinicians who treat patients and perform biopsies and surgeries at those centers have 

&#160; 

&#160; 

allowed us to develop an extensive collection of in vivo , ex vivo and in vitro cancer models. Given our belief that the human immune system can play an important role in combating cancer and that future treatments will involve combination therapies, we have introduced elements of a functional immune system into these models. Our proprietary models allow our research team to better select targets and to screen and evaluate therapeutic agents we believe have significant potential alone or in combination for treating a variety of cancers. Our models are a key component in the screening cascade we follow in our drug discovery effort and permit us to evaluate potential drug candidates in conditions that much better approximate a patient&#146;s cancer at the time of treatment. This is particularly significant when drug discovery requires evaluation not only of monotherapies but also multiple combinations and regimens targeting specific mutations while simultaneously immobilizing the defenses cancer cells mount against the human immune system. We expect to continue investing in and enhancing our cancer biology platform to further advance our capabilities for the discovery of drug candidates with best-in-class characteristics and the potential for use in immuno-oncology combination therapies. 

&#160; 

We have used our cancer biology platform to develop four clinical-stage drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class. In addition, we believe that each has the potential to be an important component of a drug combination addressing major unmet medical needs. Our clinical-stage drug candidates include three molecularly targeted agents, BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283 and one immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317. BGB-3111 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK. BGB-290 is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. BGB-283 is a small molecule designed to inhibit both the monomer and dimer forms of the RAF kinase. For each of our molecularly targeted drug candidates, we have achieved proof-of-concept by demonstrating objective responses in the defined patient populations. Our clinical-stage immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317, is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to act against the immune checkpoint receptor, programmed cell death-1, or PD-1. In addition to our clinical-stage drug candidates, we have a robust pipeline of preclinical programs and are planning to advance one or more of these programs into the clinic in the next 18 months. We have granted exclusive licenses of the rights to develop and commercialize BGB-283 worldwide (outside of China) to Merck KGaA. We have all commercial rights for all of our other clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs. 

&#160; 

Our research operations are in China, which we believe confers clinical, commercial and regulatory advantages. Our location provides us with access to a deep scientific talent pool and proximity to extensive clinical trial resources through collaborations with leading cancer hospitals in China. In addition, China accounts for approximately 20&#150;25% of the world&#146;s cancer population and is experiencing rapid growth in the market for cancer therapeutics. Currently, many global standard-of-care therapies are not approved or available in China, resulting in a significant need for innovative therapeutics with strong efficacy and safety profiles for patients who are naive to such treatments. While we plan to seek worldwide regulatory approval for our drug candidates, we also plan to seek expedited approval from the CFDA for our drug candidates as locally developed (Category 1) drugs. Expedited approval of our drug candidates in China will address the current unmet need in China and further our understanding and characterization of these drugs for approval in other markets. 

&#160; 

We have a global team of approximately 240 employees and consultants, including a global research and development team of over 160 scientists, clinicians, and staff. Our team shares the vision of improving the lives of cancer patients globally and has built a scientifically-driven and collaborative culture fostering both nimble and rational decision-making. Our management team and scientific advisory board have deep experience and capabilities in biology, chemistry, drug discovery, clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our scientific advisory board is chaired by our co-founder Xiaodong Wang, Ph.D., a highly respected cancer scientist, member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and head of China&#146;s National Institute of Biological Sciences. Our scientific advisory board also includes Ronald Levy, M.D., Ph.D.; Neal Rosen, M.D., Ph.D.; Charles Sawyers, M.D.; David Schenkein, M.D.; Jedd Wolchok, M.D., Ph.D.; and Steve Young, Ph.D. 

&#160; 

Since our inception in 2010, we have raised $170 million in private equity financing from our dedicated group of investors, including leading healthcare-focused funds, major mutual funds, China-based funds and our founders. On February 8, 2016, we completed our initial public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $166.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Next Generation of Cancer Treatment 

&#160; 

We believe that oncology treatment is rapidly evolving, offering patients the promise of high rates of more durable responses that improve survival from weeks to years while avoiding the severe toxicities typically associated with chemotherapy. While these outcomes may occasionally be achieved with monotherapy, we believe that the emergence of resistance is a major problem and that better outcomes will be achievable by combining multiple drugs as it is done in treating infectious diseases. 

&#160; 

The next generation of cancer therapies will be based, we believe, on advances in four areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Reclassification of disease based on underlying molecular defect. Due to breakthroughs in gene sequencing and methods of tumor characterization, cancer is increasingly being redefined from a paradigm of tumor classification based on originating tissue type, such as lung, colorectal or ovarian, to one of characterization based on the genetic aberrations and signature gene expression patterns, such as in HER2, BRCA, BRAF, ALK and EGFR. As a result, many more disease subpopulations can be specifically targeted, resulting in more effective treatment than was possible in the past. Disease classifications are substantially more sophisticated than 10 years ago, and we believe they will become increasingly so in the future.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Effective molecularly targeted therapy, but often limited durability. The ability to better understand the mechanisms underlying cancer has allowed the development of effective drugs that target important molecular drivers and generate high response rates in tumors with these drivers. Examples of approved drugs include gefitinib and erlotinib for patients with EGFR mutations, crizotinib and ceritinib for patients with ALK translocations, and vemurafenib and dabrafenib for patients with BRAF mutations. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, responses have been relatively short-lived as cancers can develop alternative mechanisms to compensate and ultimately bypass these drugs&#146; blockade of molecular signaling. For example, while 52% of previously treated metastatic melanoma patients with BRAF V600E achieved an objective response once treated with vemurafenib, the median duration of response was only 6.5 months.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable clinical benefit, demonstrating the power of the immuno-oncology approach. Improved understanding of cancer immunology has led to the identification of critical immune checkpoints&#151;i.e., mechanisms by which cancer cells evade the surveillance of the immune system. Inhibitors of the immune checkpoints CTLA-4 and PD-1 have shown success in the clinic. Two PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been approved by the FDA, for treating certain patients with metastatic melanoma and in the case of nivolumab, squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The results from clinical trials with several immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy have shown at least a signal of efficacy in a wide spectrum of cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, esophagus cancer, ovarian cancer, Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and a subtype of colorectal cancer. In addition, these agents can be effective against large tumors. In some tumors, including squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, randomized Phase 3 trials have reportedly demonstrated superior overall survival using PD-1 antibodies compared to chemotherapy. Although certain distinct toxicities associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been observed, these agents have been generally well-tolerated.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The need for and early promise of combination therapy. While clinical data with molecularly targeted drugs as monotherapy have been encouraging, achieving a high rate of durable responses remains difficult in most cancer types. Clinical results of immuno-oncology agents such as checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 antibodies have been reported. However, objective responses have been achieved in only a minority of unselected, solid tumor patients even in highly immunogenic tumors such as melanoma. Although the biological mechanisms underlying combinations are not yet well understood, recent third-party clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of combination therapy to achieve high tumor response rates, as are often seen with targeted

&#160; 

&#160; 

therapy, but with greater durability, as is seen with immuno-therapy agents. The combination of targeted and immuno-therapies may generate durable responses with much better survival rates. 

&#160; 

We believe that the industry-standard for cancer biology models has not evolved along with current oncology research and drug discovery and thus is an insufficient framework from which to develop the next generation of oncology drugs we envision. In response, we have built a comprehensive cancer biology platform specifically to address a new generation of cancer treatments. 

&#160; 

Next-Generation Cancer Biology Platform 

&#160; 

Fundamental changes in cancer research led us early in our history to develop a cancer biology platform that incorporates improved models and processes better suited to drug discovery in the new world of immuno-oncology combinations and addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies. Conventional models for oncology drug discovery have used cultured cell lines that are often decades old and have characteristics that are not representative of the tumors in actual cancer patients. In addition, tumors from these cell lines have been transplanted in immune-compromised hosts in commonly-used xenograft tumor models. Therefore, animal models utilizing these cell lines have limited predictive value for new therapies. While animal models derived from surgical samples, such as patient-derived xenograft models, or PDX models, are an improvement over the old cell lines, a surgical sample is unlikely to represent the state of the cancer at the time of intended treatment. Because conventional models, including PDX models, require the use of immune-deficient animals, they cannot mimic interactions between the tumor and the host immune system. 

&#160; 

The cancer biology platform we developed enables us to test a large panel of tumor models for sensitivity to the drug candidates we generated, identify drug-resistance mechanisms in many cancers, explore combination strategies and regimens, and improve our understanding of the contributions of tumor micro- and macro-environments in cancer treatments. 

&#160; 

Scientific Approach. &#160; Our platform brings together the following:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Access to a broad array of primary patient biopsies and tissue samples, enabled by our proximity to and partnerships with leading China-based oncology centers, allows us to build novel in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models that we believe more accurately represent patients&#146; cancer disease states at the time of treatment.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Methods for better approximating the interactions between a tumor and a patient&#146;s immune system, including:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Introduction of elements of the human immune system into our in vivo , ex vivo and in vitro models; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Creation of a variety of novel assays to investigate the effects of drug combinations and study their impacts on the human immune system and the tumor microenvironment.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; An effective screening cascade for oncology drug development that incorporates all of these elements.

&#160; 

Sustainable Leadership Position. &#160; We believe that our early recognition of the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies in developing new models for future cancer research has allowed us to develop a proprietary cancer biology platform that provides significant competitive advantages in developing the next generation of cancer therapeutics.

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that several of these advantages are sustainable: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Our close relationships with clinicians and our proximity to major oncology centers in China provide us convenient and difficult-to-replicate access to primary tissue samples that greatly enhance the effectiveness of our oncology models.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Our time and effort in developing and validating new models and processes, through the commitment and focus of our large scientific team, has allowed us to advance our capabilities meaningfully ahead of many current cancer drug development approaches. Over the last five years, our team of over 50 biologists has been focused on the continued development of our cancer biology platform.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Our non-hierarchical structure and highly cooperative organizational culture allows us to access the cross-functional capabilities needed to develop, maintain and continually improve our new generation cancer biology platform.

&#160; 

Our robust preclinical and clinical pipeline demonstrates our significant commitment and ability to devote the necessary time, energy and resources required to build, validate and continue to advance our cancer biology platform. Our platform has enabled us to advance four candidates to the clinic and to become, we believe, one of only two companies today to wholly own both a clinical-stage BTK inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor and one of the few companies to have discovered and advanced to clinical stage, a PARP inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor, or a BRAF inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor, for use as combination therapy. We believe that our cancer biology platform is critical to developing rational combinations that enable us to become a leader in next-generation cancer therapies. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

We have used our cancer biology platform to develop four clinical-stage drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class. In addition, we believe that each has the potential to be an important component of a drug combination addressing major unmet medical needs. 

&#160; 

Moreover, we believe that compounds in our clinical and preclinical pipeline have the potential to be first-in-class therapeutics in China, and, as locally developed compounds, to qualify for a separate, and potentially accelerated, regulatory path. 

&#160; 

Over time, we intend to strengthen our position with additional drug combinations utilizing our own drugs and in some cases third-party drugs to compete globally as first-in-combination and best-in-combination cancer therapies. 

&#160; 

Our Initial Clinical Candidates 

&#160; 

We have a pipeline of four clinical-stage drug candidates. Based on preclinical and clinical data, we believe all of our drug candidates have the potential of becoming, alone and in combination, demonstrably better than drugs currently approved to treat several types of cancers. We believe our research team&#146;s discovery of these drug candidates and our extensive preclinical portfolio of drug candidates demonstrates the value of our proprietary cancer biology platform. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes our clinical pipeline: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

(1) Limited collaboration with Merck KGaA. 

(2) Partnered with Merck KGaA outside China. 

&#160; 

BGB-3111 is a potent and highly selective small molecule BTK inhibitor. We are currently developing BGB-3111 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a variety of lymphomas. BGB-3111 has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK and higher exposure than ibrutinib, the only BTK inhibitor currently approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.

&#160; 

We have completed the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia, and we are currently conducting the dose-expansion phase in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. We have initiated a combination trial with obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody recently approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the United States. We have dosed over 100 patients with BGB-3111 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March 25, 2016. In the completed dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, no protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities, or treatment discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events were observed. BGB-3111 achieved up to approximately a 3.5- to 7-fold higher exposure level than the approved doses of ibrutinib. Proof-of-concept has been established for BGB-3111 with clinical data indicating that BGB-3111 is a potent BTK inhibitor with objective anti-tumor activity observed in multiple types of lymphomas starting at the lowest dose tested, 40 mg once daily, or QD. In addition, sustained BTK occupancy was achieved in the lymph node for both 320 mg QD and 160 mg twice daily, or BID, dosing regimens.

&#160; 

We plan to advance BGB-3111 to global registration studies in 2016, pending feedback from regulatory authorities. In addition to monotherapy studies and a combination trial with obinutuzumab, we plan to initiate a combination trial of BGB-3111 with BGB-A317, our proprietary PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in blood-borne and solid organ tumors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We also filed a Clinical Trial Application in China in December 2014 and received CTA approval in February 2016 for all phases of clinical testing. We believe that BGB-3111 is the first BTK inhibitor being developed in China under the domestic regulatory pathway to enter the clinic. We plan to initiate registration studies for BGB-3111 in China in 2016. 

&#160; 

BGB-A317 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1. We are developing BGB-A317 as a monotherapy and as a combination agent for various solid-organ and blood-borne cancers. PD-1 is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in down-regulating the immune system by preventing the activation of certain types of white blood cells called T-cells. PD-1 inhibitors remove the blockade of immune activation by cancer cells.

&#160; 

We believe BGB-A317 is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies with the ability to bind Fc gamma receptor I, or Fc&#947;RI, specifically engineered out, and we believe this could potentially result in improved activities. In addition, BGB-A317 has a unique binding signature to PD-1 with high affinity and superior target specificity. 

&#160; 

We are evaluating BGB-A317 in the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in relapsed or refractory solid tumor patients and a combination trial with our PARP inhibitor, BGB-290, in Australia. We have dosed over 100 patients as of March 25, 2016. 

&#160; 

With an ongoing clinical trial in Australia, we believe that BGB-A317 is the first PD-1 antibody being developed in China under the domestic regulatory pathway to enter the clinic. 

&#160; 

BGB-290 is a molecularly targeted, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. We are currently developing BGB-290 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of homologous recombination deficient cancers, which are cancers that contain abnormalities in their DNA molecule repair mechanisms, making these cancers particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. On February 2, 2016, we initiated a trial with BGB-290 in combination with BGB-A317 for the treatment of cancers with mutations in the BRCA gene or deficiencies in homologous recombination or mismatch repair, including ovarian, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate combination trials with chemotherapies for the treatment of gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma.

&#160; 

We believe BGB-290 has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, the only PARP inhibitor currently approved by the FDA and the EMA, in terms of selectivity, DNA-trapping activity, oral bioavailability and brain penetration. 

&#160; 

We are evaluating BGB-290 in the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia. We have dosed over 50 patients with BGB-290 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March 25, 2016. Initial analysis of data from this trial has shown BGB-290 to be well-tolerated. Proof-of-concept has also been established, with anti-tumor activity seen starting at the lowest tested dose and data suggestive of a wide therapeutic window. 

&#160; 

With an ongoing clinical trial in Australia, we believe BGB-290 is the first PARP inhibitor being developed in China under the domestic regulatory pathway to enter the clinic. 

&#160; 

BGB-283 is a small molecule RAF inhibitor. We are currently developing BGB-283 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway, including BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS gene mutations where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. The MAPK pathway is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. This pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival and is described in more detail in the section titled &#147;&#151;Product Pipeline&#151;BGB-283, RAF Dimer Inhibitor&#151;Mechanism of Action.&#148; We intend to develop BGB-283 to treat various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma. We believe BGB-283 has the potential to be a first-in-class RAF dimer inhibitor globally.

&#160; 

Currently approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are only active against the BRAF monomer. However, dimerization has been reported to be one of the key mechanisms of resistance to first generation BRAF inhibitors. BGB-283 inhibits not only the monomer but also the dimer forms of BRAF. BGB-283 

&#160; 

&#160; 

has also shown encouraging results as a monotherapy and in combination therapy in our proprietary preclinical models including KRAS-driven tumors where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. 

&#160; 

We have completed the dose-escalation phase, and we are currently conducting the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand in a broad range of patient populations, including BRAF mutated melanoma, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other non-BRAF mutated tumors as well as KRAS/NRAS mutated endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other KRAS/NRAS mutation bearing cancers, where first-generation BRAF inhibitors have not been effective. We have also initiated the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in China. We have dosed a total of 129 patients in Australia, New Zealand, and China as of January 15, 2016. Initial analysis of data from these trials has shown BGB-283 to be well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. We have achieved proof-of-concept in a range of cancers including those with KRAS and BRAF mutations. 

&#160; 

We received approval of our Clinical Trial Application for BGB-283 in China on July 16, 2015 and patient dosing in the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in China has been initiated. We believe that BGB-283 is the first BRAF inhibitor to enter the clinic in China under the domestic regulatory pathway. We have granted exclusive licenses for the rights to develop and commercialize BGB-283 to Merck KGaA worldwide (outside China). We are currently conducting all clinical development and will continue to do so until Merck KGaA exercises its Continuation Option as further described in the section titled &#147;&#151;Collaboration with Merck KGaA.&#148; 

&#160; 

Our Preclinical Programs 

&#160; 

Our proprietary cancer biology platform has also allowed us to develop several preclinical-stage drug candidates in potentially important areas. These currently consist of targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents including a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, an additional RAF dimer inhibitor, a TIM-3 cell surface protein monoclonal antibody, and a BTK inhibitor for non-oncology indications. We anticipate advancing one or more of our preclinical assets into the clinic in the next 18 months. We believe we have the opportunity to combine our PD-1 monoclonal antibody with other clinical-stage and preclinical candidates in our pipeline portfolio to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. 

&#160; 

Merck KGaA Collaboration 

&#160; 

We have granted exclusive licenses to the rights to develop and commercialize BGB-283 to Merck KGaA worldwide (outside of China). We have not granted commercial rights to our other drug candidates and retain exclusive rights to BGB-283 in China. In the area of BRAF, we are limited from competing within the licensed individual patents for BGB-283, but are otherwise free to develop drug candidates directed to those targets and have active programs in those areas. We also have a limited collaboration with Merck KGaA on our BGB-290 PARP program. For more information on our collaborations with Merck KGaA, please see the section titled &#147;&#151;Collaboration with Merck KGaA.&#148; 

&#160; 

Regulatory Framework and Structural Advantages of Being a China-Based Research and Development Organization 

&#160; 

We believe that basing our research and development effort in China offers important regulatory advantages that differentiate us from most multinational biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These advantages include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Potential for more rapid approval in the world&#146;s second largest commercial market, China, due to a separate regulatory framework for locally developed drug candidates. This faster and more efficient pathway to approval creates the potential for our drug candidates to be first-in-class locally and to obtain approval in China prior to ex-China developed candidates. By developing our compounds preclinically and manufacturing them in China, we have the ability to seek product approval from the CFDA as a domestic Category 1 drug. This domestic Category 1 designation allows us to use a faster route for bringing our products to market than the Category 3 regulatory process available to multinational companies with drugs approved for marketing by major foreign drug regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or EMA. We believe the Category 1 regulatory pathway will allow us to provide patients in China more rapid access to safe and effective cancer therapies.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The opportunity to supplement and accelerate global clinical development by accessing the Category 1 China local regulatory path for locally developed drug candidates to enable more rapid clinical trial enrollment from a pool of approximately 20&#150;25% of the world&#146;s cancer patients. The prevalence rates for some cancers, such as lung, gastric, liver and esophageal are higher in China, and for others, such as breast and cervical, are lower.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Currently, many global standard-of-care therapies are not approved or available in China, resulting in a significant need for innovative therapeutics with strong efficacy and safety profiles. As a result, we believe there is a higher likelihood that drug candidates that have demonstrated proof-of-concept in the clinic and become qualified for the Category 1 regulatory pathway will receive regulatory approval in China.

&#160; 

We believe our strategy and approach is aligned with the Chinese government&#146;s policies, and we intend to continue to work with local authorities to bring innovative therapeutics to patients in China as quickly as possible. 

&#160; 

In August 2015, the Chinese State Council, or State Council, issued a statement, Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical devices , that contained several potential policy changes that could benefit the pharmaceutical industry: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to accelerate innovative drug approval with a special review and approval process, with a focus on areas of high unmet medical needs, including drugs for HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases, orphan diseases and drugs on national priority lists.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to adopt a policy which would allow companies to act as the marketing authorization holder and to hire contract manufacturing organizations to produce drug products.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to improve the review and approval of clinical trials, and to allow companies to conduct clinical trials at the same time as they are in other countries and encourage local clinical trial organizations to participate in international multi-center clinical trials.

&#160; 

In November 2015, the CFDA released Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval , or the No. 230 Circular, which further clarified the following policies potentially simplifying and accelerating the approval process of clinical trials: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A one-time umbrella approval procedure allowing approval of all phases of a new drug&#146;s clinical trials at once, rather than the current phase-by-phase approval procedure, will be adopted for new drugs&#146; clinical trial application.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following applications: (1) registration of innovative new drugs treating HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases and orphan diseases; (2) registration of pediatric drugs; (3) registration of geriatric drugs and drugs treating China-prevalent diseases; (4) registration of drugs sponsored by national science and technology grants; (5) registration of innovative drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive clinical benefits; (6) registration of foreign innovative drugs to be manufactured locally in China; (7) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the United States or European Union or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the United States or European Union and are manufactured using the same production line in China; and (8) clinical trial applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within one year.

&#160; 

&#160; 

In February 2016, the CFDA released the Opinions on Priority Review and Approval for Resolving Drug Registration Applications Backlog , which further clarified the following policies potentially accelerating the approval process of certain clinical trials or drug registrations which may benefit us: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following drug registration applications with distinctive clinical benefits: (1) registration of innovative drugs not sold within or outside China; (2) registration of innovative drug transferred to be manufactured in China; (3) registration of drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive treatment advantages; (4) clinical trial applications for drugs patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with patent expiry within one year; (5) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the United States or European Union, or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the United States or European Union and are manufactured using the same production line in China; (6) traditional Chinese medicines (including ethnic medicines) with clear position in prevention and treatment of serious diseases; and (7) registration of new drugs sponsored by national key technology projects or national key development projects.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration approval pathway will be available for the following drugs registration application with distinctive clinical benefits for prevention and treatment of HIV, phthisis, virus hepatitis, orphan diseases, cancer, children&#146;s diseases, and geriatrics.

&#160; 

In March 2016, the CFDA released a circular, CFDA Announcement on Reforms of Pharmaceutical Registration Classification , which outlined the re-classifications of drug applications. Under the new categorization, innovative drugs that have not been approved either in or outside China remain Category 1, while drugs approved outside China seeking marketing approval in China are now Category 5. 

&#160; 

The CFDA is soliciting public opinions on detailed policies regarding fast track clinical trial approval and drug registration pathway, and we expect that the CFDA review and approval process will improve over time. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Framework for Novel Drugs in China 

&#160; 

The CFDA categorizes domestically-manufactured innovative drug applications as Category 1 and imported innovative drug applications as Category 3. Until a recent CFDA announcement issued on March 4, 2016, these different types of applications were known as Category 1 and Category 3 applications, respectively. 

&#160; 

Most Chinese companies&#146; applications are filed in Category 1 if the drug has not already been approved by the FDA or EMA. Most multinational pharmaceutical companies&#146; drug registration applications are filed in Category 3. 

&#160; 

These two categories have distinct approval pathways as discussed below. 

&#160; 

Domestic Innovative Drug Registration Process 

&#160; 

For domestically manufactured innovative drug applications, companies are required to obtain approval of a Clinical Trial Application before conducting Phase 1 clinical trials in China. The domestic innovative drug registration pathway has a fast track review and approval mechanism if the drug candidate is on a national priority list. We believe the local drug registration process is a faster and more efficient path to approval in the Chinese market than Category 3. 

&#160; 

Imported Innovative Drug Registration Process 

&#160; 

For a drug that has received marketing approval in other countries, but is not yet approved in China, in order to market an imported drug in China, companies must apply for an Import Drug License, or IDL, after the drug has received marketing approval and a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product, or CPP, from a major foreign drug regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA. Compared with the domestic innovative registration process, the imported innovative drug registration process is more complex and evolving. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The first step in the process after receipt of a CPP, is to obtain approval of a Clinical Trial Application to conduct registration studies. A pharmacokinetic study in Chinese subjects is also required. Once this study is completed, the applicant must submit the clinical data package to the CFDA along with other required information for the issuance of an IDL. The total IDL approval process has typically taken more than five years from the receipt of foreign marketing approval. 

&#160; 

Currently, the most common strategy for multinational companies is using multi-regional clinical trial, or MRCT, data to support IDL approval. Companies can apply to conduct these MRCTs prior to receiving global regulatory approval, with China as a subset within a broader MRCT. However, these MRCTs are often not designed in a way that accounts for the unique characteristics of the Chinese patient population and local standards of care. If the MRCT data does not meet the CFDA&#146;s registration requirements, the company may be required to conduct additional local clinical trials that can potentially delay market access in China for imported drugs by an additional three to four years. 

&#160; 

The Chinese State Council and the CFDA have recently issued several statements and circulars aimed at improving and accelerating the new drug approval process in general. These include the August 2015 statement issued by the State Council, Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical devices ; the November 2015 CFDA No. 230 Circular, Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval ; February 2016 CFDA Circular, Opinions on Priority Review and Approval for Resolving Drug Registration Applications Backlog ; and the March 2016 CFDA No. 51 Circular, Announcement on Reforms of Pharmaceutical Registration Classification issued by the CFDA on March 4, 2016. In the March 4, 2016 CFDA announcement, the drugs approved outside China seeking marketing approval in China are now called Category 5. We believe these new regulatory initiatives will likely accelerate the approval process for new drugs, including those marketed in other countries but not yet in China. However, how and when this approval process will be changed is still subject to further policies to be issued by the CFDA and is currently uncertain. 

&#160; 

Our drug candidates are all new therapeutic agents and we have built research and development, clinical trial capabilities, and commercial manufacturing facilities in China. As a result, we expect that all of our current drug candidates will fall within the Category 1 application process. For example, we filed a Clinical Trial Application for BGB-283 as Category 1 and recently received CFDA approval for conducting clinical trials in China. In July 2015 the CFDA approved our Clinical Trial Application including all phases of our clinical trials for BGB-283. In February 2016 the CFDA approved our Clinical Trial Application including all phases of our clinical trials for BGB-3111. We have filed similar Clinical Trial Applications for BGB-290 and BGB-A317. 

&#160; 

Commercial Opportunities in China 

&#160; 

In addition to the structural and clinical advantages afforded to us by basing our research and development operations in China, we see an attractive and growing commercial oncology opportunity in our home market. We continue to retain commercial rights in China for all four of our clinical programs and all preclinical programs. 

&#160; 

China&#146;s Pharmaceutical Market 

&#160; 

China&#146;s pharmaceutical market has grown robustly and replaced Japan as the second largest pharmaceutical market in 2013, according to IMS Health. According to the IMS Market Prognosis published in March 2015, the Chinese pharmaceutical market was $109 billion in 2014, as compared to a $373 billion U.S. pharmaceutical market in 2014, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 9.3% over the next five years reaching $171 billion by 2019. The growth of the Chinese pharmaceutical market is attributable, in particular to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; An aging population, modern diet, lack of exercise and environmental issues that are increasing the prevalence of chronic diseases.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increases in disease prevalence, awareness, diagnostics and treatment rates.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The continuous and rapid increase of personal disposable income and the establishment of basic national health insurance coverage; making health care more accessible to more patients.

&#160; 

&#160; 

China provides an opportunity to access largely untapped clinical trial pools and develop drugs for a population for whom global standard of care therapies are not available. China has nearly a quarter of the world&#146;s cancer patient population and one third to half of cancer patients in certain tumor types are in China. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Note: Data from World Health Organization (2012). * New cancer incidences estimated to increase to $19 and $25 million in 2025 and 2035, respectively. 

&#160; 

The oncology market in China is estimated to have grown at a CAGR of 24% in the last decade through 2014. In recent years, sales of targeted therapy drugs in retail channels have increased rapidly. Although expensive targeted therapy drugs are not included in basic national healthcare insurance and have historically had very little coverage by provincial insurance plans, the targeted therapy drug market has continued to grow rapidly despite being an out-of-pocket market. This growth is attributable to patients&#146; needs, willingness to pay and newly launched drugs.

Introduction of Reimbursement 

&#160; 

The State Council requires central and provincial authorities across the PRC to promote a medical insurance program for major illnesses. By the end by 2015, all urban and rural residents covered by basic medical insurance programs are required to be covered by the insurance program for major illnesses, according to a State Council policy issued on July 28, 2015. As a complement to basic insurance programs, this program is required to cover at least 50% of the medical cost incurred in connection with treating major illnesses and is supplemental to basic insurance programs. The State Council now requires provincial authorities to increase reimbursement rates over the next three years. 

&#160; 

According to the PRC Central Government&#146;s guidance issued in March 2015, each province will decide which drugs to include in its provincial major illness reimbursement lists and the percentage of reimbursement, based on local funding. For example, Zhejiang province, located in the Yangtze river delta area with a population of 55 million, announced its provincial major illness drug reimbursement list in early 2015. The list includes 31 high-priced drugs, 15 of which are targeted therapy agents for cancer, including Glivec, Ireesa, Erbitux, Herceptin, and Rituxan. Although it will take three years to establish comprehensive national coverage, the affordability of the high-priced, novel cancer agents to Chinese patients will improve significantly and the targeted therapy market is expected to enter a rapid growth period. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Mission and Strategy 

&#160; 

Our mission is to become a global leader in the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. To achieve our mission, we intend to pursue the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Rapidly advance our pipeline programs through global development. In the next 12 months, we plan to make significant advances within our clinical-stage pipeline. For BGB-3111, we have initiated a monotherapy dose-expansion trial for a variety of lymphomas. For BGB-A317, we plan to initiate a monotherapy dose-expansion trial for various cancers. For BGB-290, we plan to initiate a monotherapy dose-expansion trial in selected tumor types that may have sensitivity to PARP inhibition. For BGB-283, we have initiated a monotherapy dose-expansion trial for a variety of BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutated cancers. For BGB-3111 and BGB-283, we will continue to enroll multiple expansion cohorts and significantly increase the number of sites globally participating in these trials. We also have a robust pipeline of preclinical programs, and are planning to advance one or more of these programs into the clinic in the next 18 months.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue global development of combination therapies. We believe our ownership of both molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs puts us in an advantageous position to develop potentially best-in-combination or first-in-combination therapies that could produce high rates of more durable responses in patients. We have four clinical-stage, independently discovered drug candidates in important and combinable molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drug classes including BTK inhibitor, PD-1 inhibitor, PARP inhibitor and RAF dimer inhibitor. We believe that we are one of only two companies today to wholly own both a clinical-stage BTK inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor and one of the few companies to have discovered, and advanced to clinical stage, a PARP inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor, or a BRAF inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor, for use as combination therapy. In addition to monotherapy trials, we are planning combination trials using internally discovered drug candidates as well as third-party agents. For BGB-3111, in January 2016 we initiated a combination trial with the anti-CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, and we plan to initiate a combination trial with BGB-A317. For BGB-283, we plan to initiate combination trials with other agents such as chemotherapy and BGB-A317. For BGB-290, we plan to initiate a combination trial with temozolomide and initiated a combination trial with BGB-A317 on February 2, 2016. For BGB-A317, in addition to our combination trial with BGB-290, we plan to initiate combination trials with our other clinical-stage molecularly targeted drug candidates.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Continue to use our cancer biology platform to discover additional candidates with best-in-class characteristics and potential for use in rational combinations. We plan to use our cancer biology platform to discover additional drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens. In the last five years, we have been successful in discovering four clinical stage and numerous promising preclinical drug candidates. By further investing in and improving our cancer biology platform, we expect that the platform will continue to help us select relevant drug targets, identify potential best-in-class drug candidates and develop regimens for rational drug combinations.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Bring transformative oncology therapeutics to our home market in China. We are committed to addressing the needs of cancer patients in our home market. China is one of the largest and fastest growing markets for cancer drugs worldwide, representing approximately 20&#150;25% of the world&#146;s cancer population and an even greater proportion in lung, liver, and gastric cancers. Because many global standard-of-care therapies are not currently approved and available in China, there is a significant unmet need for innovative cancer drugs for patients who are naive to such treatments. In addition, focusing on cancer types of high prevalence in China will aid our global development efforts in these indications. We plan to seek approval from the CFDA for our cancer drugs as domestic Category 1 drugs and strive to have our drug candidates selected and listed as national priorities. The ability to launch our cancer drugs in our home market, which has a large patient population, will also help us establish broad safety and efficacy profiles for each drug, enabling us to build a full portfolio for future drug combinations.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Maintain our culture as we grow our business globally. We believe our science-driven, cooperative and non-hierarchical culture is a key strength of our organization and will continue to be instrumental to our success. As an innovative biotechnology company with research facilities in China, we have been able to attract an internationally trained research team of over 110 talented scientists. Many members of our team moved back to China from other countries to join us because they share our goals of advancing the discovery and development of drugs in China and of working with Chinese clinicians to treat their patients with innovative and effective drugs not currently available to them. We intend to maintain our patient-focused and research-driven culture as we discover and develop new drugs for China and the rest of the world.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Retain the value of our pipeline in our core focus area of oncology. We currently collaborate with Merck KGaA on our BGB-283 program, but retain exclusive development and commercial rights in China, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. Additionally, we currently retain all worldwide development and commercial rights for our other clinical and preclinical therapeutics. We also have a limited collaboration with Merck KGaA on our BGB-290 PARP program. We intend to protect our ability to direct global preclinical studies and clinical trials for our drug candidates as monotherapy and combination therapy and to maintain exclusive rights in our home market. However, we may opportunistically evaluate additional collaboration opportunities that could increase the value of our programs by accessing the expertise or infrastructure of strategic collaborators or by developing drug candidates with potential applications outside of our strategic focus on cancer.

&#160; 

Product Pipeline 

&#160; 

BGB-3111, Bruton&#146;s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor 

&#160; 

BGB-3111 is a potent and highly selective small molecule BTK inhibitor. We are currently developing BGB-3111 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a variety of lymphomas. BGB-3111 has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than ibrutinib, the only BTK inhibitor currently approved by the FDA and EMA and appears to exhibit greater target inhibition as well. 

&#160; 

We have completed the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia, and we are currently conducting the dose-expansion phase in patients with select lymphoid malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. We have initiated a combination study with obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody recently approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the United States. We have dosed over 100 patients with BGB-3111 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March 25, 2016. In the completed dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, no protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities, or treatment discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events were observed. BGB-3111 achieved up to approximately a 3.5- to 7-fold higher exposure level than the approved doses of ibrutinib. Proof-of-concept has been established for BGB-3111 with clinical data indicating that BGB-3111 is a potent BTK inhibitor with objective anti-tumor activity observed in multiple types of lymphomas starting at the lowest dose tested, 40 mg QD.

&#160; 

Mechanism of Action 

&#160; 

BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor, or BCR, signaling pathway and is an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block BCR-induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell death in certain malignant white blood cells called B-cells. BGB-3111 is an orally active inhibitor of BTK that covalently binds to the cysteine Cys-481 of BTK, resulting in irreversible inactivation of the kinase. Nine other kinases in the human genome, including ITK, EGFR and JAK3, contain this similar cysteine residue. It has also been shown that BTK inhibitors can inhibit solid tumor growth by regulating the tumor microenvironment in preclinical animal models. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Lymphomas are a group of blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphomas, chronic B-cell leukemias, predominantly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute B-cell leukemias. Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas are also characterized 

&#160; 

&#160; 

as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas make up approximately 85% of non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphomas and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. Preliminary data from animal models involving BGB-3111 and third-party BTK inhibitors also suggest potential applications in solid tumors and inflammatory diseases, which could substantially expand our market opportunity. 

&#160; 

Current Therapies and Limitations 

&#160; 

Conventional methods of treatment of lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology, but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, and, less frequently, radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas, including BCR signaling inhibitors, primarily with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the PI3K delta inhibitor idelalisib. In addition, there are other inhibitors of BCR signaling pathways in development, such as PI3K delta/gamma, IRAK4 and SYK. 

&#160; 

The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was first approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy. Since 2013, ibrutinib has received supplemental FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have received at least one prior therapy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 17p deletion, and patients with Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib is also approved by the EMA for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have received at least one prior therapy, or first line in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 17p deletion or TP53 gene mutation and are unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. The EMA has also accepted an application for potential label expansion for patients with Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib has subsequently been approved in over 40 countries, but not China. Reported U.S. sales of ibrutinib were $492 million in 2014, the first full year after launch, and $267 million in the third quarter of 2015. In addition to the approved indications, positive Phase 3 results have been announced for ibrutinib in treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma patients aged 65 or older. Clinical data also suggest that ibrutinib has activity in other common lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 

&#160; 

Despite the clinical and commercial success of ibrutinib, we believe based on its product profile that meaningful differentiation is possible in at least the following aspects: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Safety and tolerability. Although ibrutinib has shown a favorable safety profile compared to traditional chemotherapies, it is associated with adverse reactions that can limit its tolerability as a chronic treatment and in some cases can be treatment-limiting or life-threatening. These adverse reactions&#151;including diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet count, bleeding and atrial fibrillation&#151;are believed to be due to ibrutinib&#146;s broad inhibition of kinases other than BTK, including EGFR, JAK3 and TEC.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Sustainable target inhibition in disease originating tissue. Although ibrutinib induced sustained BTK inhibition when measured in the plasma of patients, our preclinical studies of ibrutinib show that target inhibition in disease originating tissues, such as bone marrow and spleen, in mice and rats was not sustained over a 24-hour period. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Oral bioavailability. Ibrutinib has shown 7&#150;23% oral bioavailability in preclinical studies, as evidenced by the daily dose of 420 mg or 560 mg required in the clinic.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Combinability with ADCC-dependent antibodies. Anti-CD20 agents, such as rituximab, obinutuzumab and ofatumumab, are considered very effective therapies for lymphomas. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that ibrutinib, potentially due to its inhibitory activity against ITK, interferes with rituximab-medicated ADCC, which is the mechanism by which rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies are believed to exert their immune defense activities. Therefore, these preclinical data suggest that the activity of rituximab and other ADCC-dependent antibodies may be reduced when combined with ibrutinib.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Potential Advantages of BGB-3111 

&#160; 

We believe, based on our preclinical and clinical data, that BGB-3111 has the potential to be differentiated from ibrutinib in the following aspects: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Better safety and tolerability. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe BGB-3111 is more selective than ibrutinib in the inhibition of BTK and has less off target inhibition of other kinases, including EGFR, ITK, JAK3, HER2 and TEC, which we believe are associated with ibrutinib toxicity. Results from our preclinical biochemical and cellular assays show that BGB-3111 has similar potency for BTK as compared to ibrutinib while being less active against other kinase targets than ibrutinib, as reflected by the higher dose required to inhibit half the enzymatic activity, or IC 50 . Based on the selectivity of BGB-3111 relative to ibrutinib, a 2- to 70-fold higher concentration of BGB-3111 is required to achieve similar levels of inhibition in these other targets as compared to ibrutinib. Therefore, BGB-3111 has the potential to be associated with fewer toxicities. Available data from our completed dose-escalation trial indicate that BGB-3111 achieved up to approximately a 7-fold higher exposure level than the approved doses of ibrutinib.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; More sustained inhibition in disease originating tissue. In our preclinical studies, BGB-3111 has demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The comparatively high drug level of BGB-3111 in disease originating tissue as demonstrated in the clinic could potentially translate into a more complete and sustainable inhibition and a better quality of response than ibrutinib. Ibrutinib demonstrated a dose-dependent BTK occupancy in PBMCs during its dose-escalation study. However, even at 420 mg, its approved dose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ibrutinib did not achieve complete or sustained target occupancy in PBMCs in a significant proportion of patients. In addition, BGB-3111&#146;s favorable safety profile may allow higher doses and more frequent dosing, which could result in more sustained target inhibition. This is currently being investigated in the clinic. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Better oral bioavailability. BGB-3111 has shown oral bioavailability of 25&#150;47% in our preclinical animal studies. Based on human data generated in our dose-escalation trial compared to reported data for ibrutinib, BGB-3111 has better oral bioavailability than ibrutinib. Pharmacokinetic data from our clinical studies show a robust and dose-dependent increase in drug exposure and the drug exposure of BGB-3111 at 80 mg QD was comparable to that reported for ibrutinib at 560 mg QD. In addition, the free drug concentration of BGB-3111 at 40 mg QD was comparable to that reported for ibrutinib at 560 mg QD. Lastly, pharmacokinetics data for BGB-3111 suggest that there appears to be far less interpatient variability in drug exposure as compared to ibrutinib.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Better combinability with ADCC-dependent antibodies. Our preclinical data show that BGB-3111 has less off-target inhibition for ITK than ibrutinib in biochemical and cell models. BGB-3111 displayed a more limited inhibitory effect on rituximab-induced ADCC than ibrutinib in cell-based studies. In a human mantle cell lymphoma xenograft model the addition of rituximab to ibrutinib did not improve tumor activity as compared to ibrutinib as a monotherapy. However, the combination of rituximab and BGB-3111 demonstrated improved anti-tumor activity as compared to either as a monotherapy. We believe this may translate into better activity in patients when BGB-3111 is combined with rituximab or other ADCC-dependent antibody therapies.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Summary of Clinical Results 

&#160; 

BGB-3111 has completed the dose-escalation phase of our multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia and is currently in the expansion-cohort part of the monotherapy trial, and we have initiated a combination trial with obinutuzumab. As of March 25, 2016, over 100 patients have been dosed with BGB-3111 in monotherapy and combination trials. 

&#160; 

The dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial for BGB-3111 started in August 2014. The trial, conducted in Australia, was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary activity of BGB-3111 as a monotherapy. In the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were enrolled in five dose cohorts (40, 80, 160, and 320 mg QD; 160 mg BID). No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. We determined the recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial based on our pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy evaluation of BGB-3111. In April 2015, we initiated the multi-cohort dose-expansion phase of the ongoing clinical trial in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. 

&#160; 

The initial results of the dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial show that, consistent with BGB-3111&#146;s pharmacokinetic profile, complete and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in the blood was demonstrated in all tested patients, starting at the lowest dose of 40 mg QD. In addition, sustained full BTK occupancy was achieved in the lymph node for both 320 mg QD and 160 mg BID dosing regimens. No protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events were observed during dose escalation. Based on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy of BGB-3111 in the dose-escalation phase, 320 mg QD and 160 mg BID are being further explored in the ongoing dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial. Proof-of-concept has been established for BGB-3111 with clinical data indicating that BGB-3111 is a potent BTK inhibitor with objective anti-tumor activity observed in multiple types of lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our IND of BGB-3111 is in effect with the FDA. We plan to pursue a full, global development of BGB-3111 with registration trials starting in 2016, pending feedback from regulatory authorities. In the coming months, we plan to finalize design of the registration programs following discussions with the FDA and EMA. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we initiated a combination trial of BGB-3111 with the CD20 antibody obinutuzumab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other lymphomas. In addition, on the basis of the supportive preclinical combination data discussed below, we plan to explore the combination of BGB-3111 with our PD-1 antibody, BGB-A317, in diseases such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma where accelerated development opportunities may be available. We are also evaluating later stage trials for various B-cell malignancies. 

&#160; 

In China, we received approval for Clinical Trial Application in February 2016 for all phases of clinical testing. We plan to start an abbreviated dose-escalation trial followed by potential single-arm registration trials in 2016 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. Because obinutuzumab is not approved in China, we plan to conduct a combination trial with the CD20 antibody rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma. In addition, we plan to start translational studies to take advantage of patient access in China to identify correlative biomarkers in diseases such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where BTK inhibitors have shown good activity in a sub-population of patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We plan to present additional data from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases of our monotherapy study with BGB-3111 in 2016. We plan to present the data from our combination trials with BGB-3111 in 2016 or 2017. 

&#160; 

BGB-A317, PD-1 Antibody 

&#160; 

BGB-A317 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1. We are developing BGB-A317 as a monotherapy and as a combination agent for various solid-organ and blood-borne cancers. PD-1 is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in down-regulating the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells. PD-1 inhibitors remove the blockade of immune activation by cancer cells. We believe BGB-A317 is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies with the ability to bind Fc gamma receptor I specifically engineered out, and we believe this could potentially result in improved activities. In addition, BGB-A317 has a unique binding signature to PD-1 with high affinity and superior target specificity. 

&#160; 

We are evaluating BGB-A317 in the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in relapsed or refractory solid tumor patients and a combination trial with our PARP inhibitor, BGB-290, in Australia. As of March 25, 2016, we have dosed over 100 patients with BGB-A317 in monotherapy and combination trials. BGB-A317 is the first drug candidate produced from our immuno-oncology biologic programs, and we believe it could serve as one of the cornerstones for our immuno-oncology combination platform. 

&#160; 

Mechanism of Action 

&#160; 

Cells called cytotoxic T-cells provide humans an important self-defense mechanism against cancer, patrolling the body, recognizing cancer cells due to immunogenic features that differ from normal cells, and killing cancer cells by injecting poisonous proteins into them. T-cells have various mechanisms built into them that prevent them from damaging normal cells, among which is a protein called PD-1 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of T-cells. The most important signaling protein that could engage PD-1 is called PD-L1, which binds the PD-1 receptor and sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-cell, stopping it from making more poisonous proteins and killing the cells sending the signal via PD-L1 and other cells nearby. Many types of cancer cells have hijacked the PD-L1 expression system that normally exists in healthy cells. By expressing PD-L1, cancer cells protect themselves from being killed by cytotoxic T-cells. BGB-A317 is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1, thereby preventing PD-L1 from engaging PD-1. Therefore, we believe BGB-A317 has the potential to restore the cytotoxic T-cell&#146;s ability to kill cancer cells. BGB-A317 belongs to a class of agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors which are currently the most important part of a new type of anti-cancer treatment called immuno-oncology therapy. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Forecasts of the market for monotherapy PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have increased as new tumor types responding to these antibodies have been identified and data has accumulated regarding their potential efficacy. It is estimated that these inhibitors will reach sales of approximately $13 billion by 2023 across seven major markets (United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan). 

&#160; 

Tumor types that have been shown to be responsive to a PD-1 antibody include several types that are common in China. These include lung, gastric and liver cancers, for which an estimated 37%, 45% and 53% of the worldwide annual incidence in 2012, respectively, was in China, according to the World Health Organization. To our knowledge, BGB-A317 is the first PD-1 antibody developed in China to enter clinical trials. Due to a distinct regulatory pathway for drug candidates manufactured in China, we believe that BGB-A317 will become an important participant in China&#146;s PD-1 antibody and immuno-oncology market. 

&#160; 

Current Therapies and Limitations 

&#160; 

Clinical trials of several monotherapy PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitory antibodies have shown a signal of efficacy in a wide spectrum of cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, a subtype of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast cancer, and a subtype of colorectal and other cancers having mismatch repair deficiency. Two such PD-1 monotherapy antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been 

&#160; 

&#160; 

approved by the FDA for treating certain patients with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and, in the case of nivolumab, renal cell carcinoma. 

&#160; 

Monotherapy PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated objective responses against these tumors that can be rapid and in most cases durable. In addition, these agents can be effective against large tumors. In some tumors, including squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, randomized Phase 3 trials conducted by third parties have demonstrated superior overall survival of PD-1 antibodies compared to standard care including chemotherapy. Although some distinct toxicities associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, overall, they have been remarkably well-tolerated. 

&#160; 

Objective responses to monotherapy PD-1 antibodies have only been seen in a minority of patients in nearly all tumor types tested with the exception of a small population of blood cancer patients with Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma and a selected subpopulation of solid tumor patients with mismatch repair deficiency. Combination therapy with a PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody as a backbone is being explored with a wide variety of agents by the industry and clinical investigators. 

&#160; 

Potential Advantages of BGB-A317 

&#160; 

We believe that having BGB-A317 in addition to our multiple clinical-stage drug candidates puts us in a strong competitive position. Based on our preclinical data, we believe a strong rationale exists for combining BGB-A317 with our drug candidates BGB-3111, BGB-283 and BGB-290. In addition, we are developing several immuno-oncology candidates that we intend to combine with BGB-A317. 

&#160; 

We believe BGB-A317 is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies with the ability to bind Fc&#947;RI, specifically engineered out, and we believe this could potentially result in improved activities. In addition, BGB-A317 has a unique binding signature to PD-1 with high affinity and superior target specificity. In preclinical studies, BGB-A317 showed better cellular functional activities in blocking PD-1 mediated reverse signal transduction and in activating human T-cells and primary PBMCs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to differentiation in complementarity-determining regions CDR sequences and key binding epitopes on PD-1, BGB-A317 has also displayed cell biology differentiation in lack of Fc receptor binding, which was recently shown to have a negative effect on the activity of PD-1 antibodies. BGB-A317 is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, in Fc&#947;RI mediated effector function. Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab bind to Fc&#947;RI, while BGB-A317 has no binding to Fc&#947;RI. A recent paper, as well as our unpublished data, show that in preclinical models Fc&#947;RI binding may compromise the activity of PD-1 antibodies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We compared the anti-cancer activity of BGB-A317 with other PD-1 antibodies in an in vivo mouse cancer model in which the mice bearing human cancer cells A431 and PBMCs were treated with BGB-A317, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or a vehicle using the same dose regimen. The results demonstrated that BGB-A317 significantly inhibited the tumor growth, while nivolumab and pembrolizumab did not reduce tumor growth in this model. 

&#160; 

Combination with BGB-3111 

&#160; 

We have explored the combination activity of BGB-3111 and BGB-A317 in both solid tumor and blood tumor preclinical models. In these models, human primary tumor fragments and immune cells from the same donor were co-injected into immune-deficient mice. The mice were then treated with BGB-3111 and BGB-A317 and their tumor growth and survival were followed. In the colorectal primary tumor model, the combination of BGB-3111 and BGB-A317 significantly prolonged survival. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, the combination of BGB-3111 and BGB-A317 was explored in two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma primary tumor models. In both models, BGB-3111 showed weak monotherapy activity. When used as a monotherapy BGB-A317 was only active in the PD-L1 positive tumor. However, the combination of BGB-3111 and BGB-A317 was highly active, better than either monotherapy, and induced tumor regression in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative models. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Combination with BGB-283 

&#160; 

We tested the combination activity of BGB-283 and BGB-A317 in a mouse cancer model in which a human lung cancer cell line with KRAS mutation was engrafted, and the results showed the synergistic efficacy of BGB-283 and BGB-A317. 

&#160; 

Summary of Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

In June 2015, BGB-A317 entered the dose-escalation phase of our multi-center, open-label trial for safety and toxicology evaluation in patients with advanced solid tumors. Clinical sites are active or being established in Australia and New Zealand, and we intend to open at least one site in the United States now that we have an IND in effect with the FDA. The Safety Monitoring Committee of the trial has cleared for testing each of the four initial dose levels (0.5, 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg every two weeks), and the 2 and 5 mg/kg every-two-week or every-three-week dose cohorts, or schedule-expansion cohorts, are being expanded with 10 to 20 patients each. We have dosed a total of 73 patients as of January 15, 2016 in four dose-escalation cohorts at 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg dosing levels and in schedule-expansion cohorts at 2 and 5 mg/kg dosing levels, and we are rapidly enrolling new patients. To date, BGB-A317 has been well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. One patient receiving the 5 mg/kg dose developed grade 3 immune-related colitis which was considered a dose-limiting toxicity and a drug-related serious adverse event. As of January 15, 2016, investigators have reported six drug-related serious adverse events, including two cases of grade 3 immune-related colitis (including the patient with dose-limiting toxicity noted above), one case of grade 3 autoimmune diabetes and one case of grade 3 diabetic ketoacidosis (occurring in the same patient), one case of grade 3 hypotension, and one case of grade 2 infusion reaction. The enrolled patient population included patients with a wide range of tumor types (more than 20) and a majority of the patients have cancers that have not been shown to respond to PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies. There were no patients with melanoma or lung cancer, two of the indications for which PD-1 antibodies have received approvals, and patients with renal cell carcinoma, the third approved indication for PD-1 antibodies, represented a small portion (approximately 10%) of the enrolled patients. In addition, efficacy assessment is early with a large number of patients who have not had a computerized 

&#160; 

&#160; 

tomography scan. While efficacy data are preliminary, signals of BGB-A317&#146;s activity have been observed with significant objective tumor shrinkage qualifying for unconfirmed partial responses or confirmed partial responses based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria reported by investigators for a small number of patients. We continue to enroll patients in the dose-escalation phase of the trial, including schedule-expansion cohorts at 2 and 5 mg/kg dosing levels, and we plan to potentially dose up to 200 patients in the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial to reach proof-of-concept in tumor types known to respond to PD-1 antibodies and to explore potential differentiation in tumor types that, to date, have been insensitive or resistant to PD-1 blockade. 

&#160; 

We plan to combine BGB-A317 with our other drug candidates, including BGB-3111, BGB-283 and BGB-290, in targeted tumors and patient populations. These targets include RAF/RAS mutated cancers such as colorectal cancers, pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer for the BGB-283 combination and B-cell malignancies and select solid tumors for the BGB-3111 combination. On February 2, 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial with BGB-290 in combination with BGB-A317 for the treatment of cancers with mutations in the BRCA gene or deficiencies in homologous recombination or mismatch repair, including ovarian, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. As of March 25, 2016, over 100 patients have been dosed with BGB-A317 in monotherapy and combination trials. 

&#160; 

We plan to focus development programs on Asia-prevalent tumors including liver, gastric, esophageal, and lung cancers. We believe we have the opportunity to supplement global enrollment in high-incidence cancers in China. In addition, we believe we have opportunities for an accelerated registration path in China given the high unmet needs. 

&#160; 

We plan to present the data from the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial at a medical conference in 2016. We also plan to present data from the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial and combination trials in 2016 or 2017. We plan to initiate our combination trials in 2016. 

&#160; 

BGB-290, PARP Inhibitor 

&#160; 

BGB-290 is a molecularly targeted, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. We are currently developing BGB-290 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of homologous recombination deficient cancers, which are cancers that contain abnormalities in their DNA repair mechanism making these cancers particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. On February 2, 2016, we initiated a trial with BGB-290 in combination with BGB-A317 for the treatment of cancers with mutations in the BRCA gene or deficiencies in homologous recombination or mismatch repair, including ovarian, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate combination trials with chemotherapies for the treatment of gastric cancer, small cell lung cancers, and glioblastoma. We believe BGB-290 has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, the only PARP inhibitor currently approved by the FDA and the EMA, in terms of selectivity, DNA-trapping activity, oral bioavailability and brain penetration. 

&#160; 

We have completed the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia and are initiating the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial. We have dosed over 50 patients with BGB-290 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March 25, 2016. Initial analysis of data from this trial has shown BGB-290 to be well-tolerated. Proof-of-concept has also been established, with anti-tumor activity seen starting at the lowest tested dose and data suggestive of a wide therapeutic window. 

&#160; 

Mechanism of Action 

&#160; 

PARP family members PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in DNA replication and transcriptional regulation and play essential roles in cell survival in response to DNA damage. PARP1 and PARP2 are key base-excision-repair proteins that function as DNA damage sensors by binding rapidly to the site of damaged DNA and modulating a variety of proteins in DNA repair processes. Inhibition of PARPs prevents the repair of common single-strand DNA breaks which leads to formation of double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Double-strand breaks in normal cells are repaired by homologous recombination, and normal cells are relatively tolerant of PARP inhibition. On the other hand, cancer cells with mutations in BRCA1/2 genes, key players in homologous recombination, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition, a phenomenon called &#147;synthetic lethality&#148; that is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors as a monotherapy for BRCA mutant cancers. In addition to hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations, the synthetic lethal concept has been broadened to include sporadic tumors that display a so-called 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#147;BRCAness&#148; profile, a gene expression profile that resembles that of a BRCA deficient tumor. BRCAness can stem from somatic mutation of BRCA1/2, epigenetic silencing of BRCA genes or genetic or epigenetic loss of function of other genes in homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathways. 

&#160; 

Another potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is rational combination therapy. PARP proteins are key factors in DNA repair pathways, in particular, base-excision-repair, which is critical for the repair of DNA lesions caused by chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. PARP inhibitors are known to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum compounds, temozolomide and ionizing radiation and can be used in combination with these agents in treating various cancers. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Glioblastoma multiforme. This is one of the frequently occurring tumors in the central nervous system. More than 10,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States. Despite aggressive treatment, glioblastoma multiforme still has a dismal prognosis. The five-year survival rate of newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme, who have received standard concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, is less than 10%. BGB-290 has shown positive combination activity with temozolomide in both temozolomide sensitive and resistant tumor models.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; BRCA mutant and BRCAness tumors. Based on a recent population-based cohort of Australian ovarian cancer patients, BRCA1/2 mutations are found in approximately 14% of ovarian cancer patients and approximately 17% of patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Further, in the United States, BRCA1/2 mutations are found in approximately 5&#150;10% of breast cancers. The BRCAness profile has been observed in up to 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers and in 66&#150;69% of breast cancer patients with the triple-negative subtype (approximately 15&#150;20% of breast cancer cases).

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive malignancy accounting for approximately 15&#150;18% of all lung cancers. Approximately 31,000 patients are diagnosed annually with small cell lung cancer in the United States. Although newly diagnosed patients often achieve objective responses with first-line cytotoxic treatments, such as platinum-etoposide based chemotherapy combined with early thoracic radiotherapy, early relapses are common. In addition, tumor metastasis to the brain is frequent among small cell lung cancer patients. In our preclinical human patient biopsy-derived tumor models, BGB-290 has shown superior combination activity with the standard first-line cytotoxic treatments, platinum plus etoposide.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with over 40% of new cases coming from China. In China, the incidence rate for gastric cancer was 23.7 per 100,000 in 2014, corresponding to over 300,000 new cases annually. At the time of diagnosis of gastric cancer, the rate of metastasis is close to 50%. The cornerstone of therapy is surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation when applicable. However, treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer has not recently progressed, and the median survival rate is less than one year. ATM is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in response to DNA damage. It regulates the signaling and the initiation of cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. In ATM-low gastric cancer patients, who account for 13&#150;22% of the gastric cancer patient population, a paclitaxel-plus-olaparib combination significantly prolonged patient overall survival in a Phase 2 study.

&#160; 

Current Therapies and Limitations 

&#160; 

There are several PARP inhibitors that are either approved (olaparib) or are in advanced clinical development, including veliparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Safety and tolerability. Current PARP inhibitors have shown significant toxicities in various areas. High frequency of myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, has been reported with several PARP inhibitors in the clinic, including talazoparib, niraparib, and olaparib. Only

&#160; 

&#160; 

rucaparib has reported a high incidence of elevation of liver enzymes associated with the drug treatment. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Limited DNA-trapping activity. Veliparib has reported a lower response rate in BRCA-mutated cancer patients. Veliparib&#146;s lower response rate is believed to be related to its weak reported DNA-trapping activity, which is the ability of a compound to trap PARP proteins at damaged DNA sites and lead to enhanced cytotoxicity to the tumor cells.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Formulation/oral availability. Formulation for certain PARP inhibitors has proven to be challenging, potentially requiring the need for a significant number of capsules to achieve desired dosing levels. As a related issue, certain PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, have poor bioavailability.

&#160; 

Potential Advantages of BGB-290 

&#160; 

BGB-290 is a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor with favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties. BGB-290 has shown favorable PARP1 and PARP2 selectivity in biochemical assays and has demonstrated improved specificity compared to other PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, in cell line proliferation screens. Enhanced selectivity could potentially translate into a better safety and tolerability profile over existing PARP inhibitors. We believe a favorable safety and tolerability profile could be particularly advantageous for the combined use of BGB-290 with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapeutic agents. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Brain penetration. BGB-290 has shown significant brain penetration in preclinical models. The brain/plasma ratio in mice after oral dosing of 10 mg/kg BGB-290 was approximately 18%. We believe the only other PARP inhibitor currently in development that has shown significant brain penetration is veliparib, which appears to be significantly less potent compared to other PARP inhibitors and has minimal DNA-trapping activity. BGB-290 has demonstrated strong synergistic anti-tumor effects with temozolomide in treating intracranially implanted glioblastoma multiforme, consistent with its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In patient-derived, small cell lung cancer xenograft models, BGB-290 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapy (etoposide plus carboplatin) during the concomitant treatment stage and kept animals in a tumor-free condition throughout their maintenance treatment. One of the major risk factors for small cell lung cancer patients is the high risk of brain metastases. Due to BGB-290&#146;s ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, we believe BGB-290 could provide a clear advantage over other PARP inhibitors in treating small cell lung cancer patients.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Greater selectivity potentially leading to improved safety and tolerability. BGB-290 is a highly active and selective PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor in biochemical and cellular assays. Based on the preliminary data reported by investigators in the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, BGB-290 appears well-tolerated, and the only drug-related adverse events that occurred in over 10% of patients are nausea, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Strong DNA-trapping activity. BGB-290 also demonstrates potent DNA-trapping activity. PARP inhibitors are reported to trap PARP protein at damaged DNA sites, creating more cytotoxic DNA lesions. The potency of DNA-trapping for PARP inhibitors is shown to be better correlated with tumor cell growth-inhibition than inhibition of PARP enzyme activity. BGB-290 has demonstrated potent activity across multiple assays: DNA-trapping, enzymatic and cellular inhibition of PARP and tumor cell growth inhibition.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Good oral bioavailability and potent target inhibition. In preclinical animal models, BGB-290 shows good oral bioavailability. BGB-290 has demonstrated bioavailability of 71&#150;76% in animal studies. In the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, we observed a linear and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile for BGB-290 with approximately two-fold accumulation at steady state. BGB-290 induced PAR inhibition in PBMCs even at the first dose level, and sustained PAR inhibition in PBMC was expected at a steady state dose of 10 mg BID or greater.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Summary of Clinical Results 

&#160; 

BGB-290 has completed the dose-escalation phase of our multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand. Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were enrolled in seven cohorts receiving monotherapy BGB-290 in doses ranging from 2.5 mg BID to 120 mg BID. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed at 120 mg BID in two patients, one with persistent grade 2 nausea and anorexia and another one with persistent grade 2 nausea, grade 3 fatigue and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, 80 mg was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose, and additional patients were enrolled to confirm the safety of an 80 mg BID dose as a potential recommended Phase 2 dose. Preliminary safety and efficacy data suggest that BGB-290 is well-tolerated with objective responses seen in multiple ovarian cancer patients including a patient receiving the lowest dose (2.5 mg) of BGB-290. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We will continue to confirm clinical activities of BGB-290 in BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and other indications with homologous recombination deficiency in the dose-expansion trial. We also plan to explore emerging indications with homologous recombination deficiency, such as prostate cancer or cancers with high frequency of brain metastasis given the potential brain penetration advantage. 

&#160; 

On February 2, 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial with BGB-290 in combination with BGB-A317 for the treatment of cancers with mutations in the BRCA gene or deficiencies in homologous recombination or mismatch repair, including ovarian, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. The Phase 1 multi-center, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial of BGB-A317 with BGB-290 is the first combination study exclusively based on drug candidates from our internal portfolio. Key objectives in the trial include determining maximum tolerated dose, recommended Phase 2 dose, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the BGB-A317 and BGB-290 combination. We have dosed over 50 patients with BGB-290 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March 25, 2016. We also plan to commence a combination trial with temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme. 

&#160; 

In China, we plan to pursue monotherapy approval in BRCA mutant ovarian cancer and breast cancer, two cancers whose unmet medical needs have not been addressed and therefore may provide accelerated development opportunity. We also plan to explore combination trials with paclitaxel in gastric cancer and platinum/etoposide in small cell lung cancers. We plan to present updated dose-escalation data in 2016 and the data from our combination trial with BGB-A317 in 2016 or 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

BGB-283, RAF Dimer Inhibitor 

&#160; 

BGB-283 is a small molecule RAF inhibitor. We are currently developing BGB-283 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the MAPK pathway, including BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS mutations where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. We intend to develop BGB-283 to treat various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Currently approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are only active against the BRAF monomer. BGB-283 inhibits not only the monomer but also the dimer forms of BRAF. We believe BGB-283 has the potential to be a first-in-class RAF dimer inhibitor globally. 

&#160; 

We have completed the dose-escalation phase, and we are currently conducting the dose-expansion phase, of our clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand in a broad range of patient populations, including BRAF mutated melanoma, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other non-BRAF mutated tumors as well as KRAS/NRAS mutated endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other KRAS/NRAS mutation bearing cancers, where first-generation BRAF inhibitors have not been effective. We have also initiated an abbreviated dose-escalation trial in China. We have dosed over 150 patients in our trials in Australia, New Zealand, and China as of March 25, 2016. Initial analysis of data from these trials has shown BGB-283 to be well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. We have achieved proof-of-concept in a range of cancers including those with KRAS and BRAF mutations. We have granted exclusive licenses for the rights to develop and commercialize BGB-283 to Merck KGaA worldwide (outside China). We are currently conducting all clinical development and will continue to do so until Merck KGaA exercises its Continuation Option as further described in the section below titled &#147;&#151;Collaboration with Merck KGaA.&#148; 

&#160; 

Mechanism of Action 

&#160; 

The MAPK pathway is a chain of proteins that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of a cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. The pathway includes a small G protein (RAS) and three protein kinases (RAF, MEK, and ERK). A kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from a donor molecule to an acceptor. This process often acts as an &#147;on&#148; or &#147;off&#148; switch to regulate cellular signaling. The MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade by external stimuli transduces signals from the plasma membrane into the cell nucleus to control gene expression and determine cell fate. Aberrant activation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway is frequently found in different types of cancers, contributing to increased cell division, suppressed apoptosis, and enhanced cell motility and invasion. In many cancers, a defect in the MAPK pathway leads to uncontrolled tumor growth. The two key components of the MAPK pathway, BRAF and RAS, are two of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. BRAF is one of the three kinases that belong to the RAF kinase family. There are three members: ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. BRAF is the most frequently mutated oncogene in this kinase superfamily. Mutated BRAF and RAS lead to activation of the MAPK pathway and promote tumor development and growth. Functions of BRAF in the MAPK pathway are key to cell proliferation and survival. Mutations that lead to activation of BRAF promote cell transformation and proliferation and thus positively correlate with tumor development and growth. The most frequent BRAF mutation, BRAF V600E, causes constitutive activation of the kinase as well as insensitivity to negative feedback mechanisms. The mutated BRAF signals as a monomer, independent of upstream growth stimuli. It has been found that RAF kinases can homo- and heterodimerize and form homodimer or heterodimer of RAF proteins. Dimerization has been reported to be one of the key mechanisms of resistance to first-generation BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib. The three most common molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance of BRAF V600E melanomas to RAF inhibitors&#151;NRAS mutation, splicing of BRAF V600E that produce a truncated BRAF kinase, and BRAF V600E overexpression due to gene amplification&#151;all result in dimerization of BRAF V600E. First-generation BRAF inhibitors only inhibit the BRAF V600E monomer form at physiologically meaningful concentrations. In contrast, BGB-283 has been shown to inhibit both BRAF V600E monomer and RAF dimer in BRAF inhibitor sensitive and resistant melanoma cell models, which is involved in signaling downstream from RAS. We believe this feature of BGB-283 may help to address the drug resistance issues in BRAF mutated tumors and further expand its utility into RAS mutated patient populations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

We believe BGB-283 has applications in both BRAF mutated cancers and RAS, including KRAS and NRAS, mutated cancers. The oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation was detected in approximately 8% of all human solid tumors, including approximately 45% of papillary thyroid cancers. Mutations in any one of the three RAS genes, HRAS, NRAS or KRAS, are among the most common events in human tumorigenesis. KRAS mutations are detected prominently in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, notable KRAS or NRAS mutation rates have been reported in melanoma, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, biliary cancer, thyroid cancer, leukemia and multiple myeloma. The first-generation, FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors have limited activity outside of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancers. In addition, these first-generation BRAF inhibitors do not exhibit activity against KRAS and NRAS mutations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Current Therapies and Limitations 

&#160; 

Small molecules that selectively target mutant BRAF have shown considerable efficacy in melanoma patients with the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are first-generation BRAF inhibitors approved by the FDA to treat late-stage BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. The limitations of the first-generation BRAF inhibitors are listed below: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Limited activity towards RAF dimers. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib have not demonstrated significant activity outside of melanoma, thyroid, and non-small cell lung cancers with BRAF V600E mutation. One potential explanation for the limited activity of these first-generation BRAF inhibitors beyond BRAF V600E mutant cancers is that they inhibit only the BRAF V600E monomer and do not inhibit the RAF dimers.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Limited activity in KRAS/NRAS mutated cancers. To date, first-generation BRAF inhibitors have not demonstrated activity in RAS mutated cancers. Efforts in developing RAS-directed molecular therapeutics have been limited by the difficulty in selectively targeting the RAS GTPase family of enzymes with small-molecule inhibitors. A number of mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or MEK, inhibitors have been developed and tested clinically but have very limited activity in patients with RAS mutated cancers.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Limited activity against EGFR. A number of studies have suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition may contribute to the poor response of colorectal cancer patients to the first generation BRAF inhibitors. First generation BRAF inhibitors do not have inhibitory activity against EGFR and as a result are not able to sequester the feedback activation of EGFR upon BRAF inhibition.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Rapid development of resistance. Despite the success of first-generation BRAF inhibitors in treating metastatic melanoma patients, they are limited by the durability of response. For example, in

&#160; 

&#160; 

previously treated metastatic melanoma patients with BRAF V600E mutation who were treated with vemurafenib, approximately 52% of the patients had an objective response, corresponding to significant tumor shrinkage but the median duration of response was only 6.5 months. Only rarely do tumors regress completely in the clinic, and for most patients the therapeutic effects are temporary as resistance to the therapies develops. Studies have shown that the majority of these resistance cases are caused by increased RAF dimer formation in response to treatment with first-generation BRAF inhibitors, resulting in the restoration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or ERK, signaling and insensitivity to drug treatment. 

&#160; 

Potential Advantages of BGB-283 

&#160; 

BGB-283 is a novel inhibitor of RAF, in both monomeric and dimeric forms. BGB-283 has demonstrated potent and reversible inhibitory activities against RAF family kinases, including wild-type ARAF, BRAF, CRAF and BRAF V600E, in biochemical assays. In addition, BGB-283 has shown potent inhibitory activity against EGFR in biochemical assays using EGFR kinases, cancer cell lines, and xenograft models. In BRAF wild-type cells that harbor the KRAS mutations, treatment with BGB-283 resulted in much reduced up-regulation of pERK, a phosphorylated form of ERK, compared with vemurafenib in cancer cell models. 

&#160; 

In preclinical testing, BGB-283 also retained inhibitory activity in vemurafenib-resistant BRAF splicing isoform p61-BRAF V600E. Data generated in preclinical studies using biochemical, cell-based and animal studies suggest that BGB-283 could offer significant patient benefit in inhibiting tumors with aberrations in the RAF MAPK/ERK pathway, including BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS mutations as either monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies. 

&#160; 

We believe BGB-283 has the potential to be differentiated from other drug candidates currently under development and from approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors due to the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increased inhibitory activity against RAF dimers. BGB-283&#146;s increased inhibitory activity against RAF dimers may potentially address resistances associated with increased RAF dimer formation in response to treatment with first-generation BRAF inhibitors. As noted above, most known molecular mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors induce RAF dimerization. As such, BGB-283&#146;s ability to inhibit RAF dimers and target disregulated MAPK pathways resistant to first-generation BRAF inhibitors could result in a clinically significant effect.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increased activity in KRAS/NRAS mutated cancers. We believe that BGB-283&#146;s RAF dimer activity could translate into anti-tumor activity in KRAS/NRAS mutated cancers. Anti-tumor activities were observed in preclinical KRAS/NRAS mutant cancer models in vivo . 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increased inhibitory activity against EGFR. BGB-283 has demonstrated inhibitory activity against EGFR. The reported response rate of vemurafenib in BRAF V600E colorectal cancer is only 5%. Two independent studies suggested that EGFR feedback activation could be one of the main mechanisms of the observed resistance to first-generation BRAF inhibitors. BGB-283 has demonstrated good EGFR inhibitory activity in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. BGB-283&#146;s activity against EGFR may help address the EGFR feedback activation observed in BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumors.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Differentiated resistance profile. BGB-283 has shown inhibitory activity against RAF dimers. An increase in RAF dimers has been observed to be a major resistance mechanism to first-generation BRAF inhibitors. A differentiated resistance profile has been observed in preclinical models for BGB-283.

&#160; 

Summary of Clinical Results 

&#160; 

The dose-escalation phase of our multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand was completed in June 2015. This trial was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of BGB-283 as a monotherapy. Relapsed or refractory solid tumor patients with BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutations were enrolled in the trial in seven dose cohorts across five sites in Australia and New Zealand. 

&#160; 

BGB-283 showed a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile, and plasma concentrations of BGB-283 increased proportionally from 5 mg through 50 mg. The mean half-life of BGB-283 was approximately 110 hours. The dose-limiting toxicity of BGB-283 in the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial conducted in Australia and New Zealand was thrombocytopenia. Based on preliminary safety data, most of the reported drug-related adverse events have been mild or moderate, with thrombocytopenia being the most frequent severe adverse event, reported in approximately 10% of the patients. As of January 15, 2016, severe adverse events that were considered to be drug-related included fever, fatigue, dehydration, thrombocytopenia, Drug Reaction with Eosinophila and Systemic Symptoms syndrome, sepsis, hyponatraema, febrile neutropenia, and constipation. Other drug-related adverse events included rash, hand-foot syndrome, and anorexia. Cutaneous malignancies such as squamous cell carcinomas, which have been observed with the approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, have not been observed in patients treated with BGB-283. Initial anti-tumor activities of BGB-283 were observed in patients with both BRAF-mutated and KRAS-mutated patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In July 2015, we initiated a multi-arm dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial in solid tumors with BRAF mutations and/or aberrations in the MAPK pathway, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other non-V600E BRAF mutated cancers, and KRAS/NRAS mutated endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other KRAS/NRAS mutated cancers. In addition, BGB-283 has shown immune sensitization and enhancement of T-cell function in preclinical studies, supporting its combination with cancer immunotherapies such as agents targeting PD-1. We have planned trials that combine BGB-283 and BGB-A317. We are also exploring alternative dosing schedules, for example, one week of dosing followed by one week without dosing. 

&#160; 

In China, we have obtained approval of our Clinical Trial Application for BGB-283. We have initiated the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in China. Among the 24 patients treated in China as of January 15, 2016, there were three treatment-related serious adverse effects, including one case of grade 3 and two cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Because the number of enrolled melanoma patients reached the targeted accrual range, and there have been more frequent observations of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in the China trial (reported in seven out of 24 patients, including three cases reported as of January 15, 2016 as serious adverse events) compared to the Australia / New Zealand trial (reported in eight out of 105 patients), we voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend new patient accrual to this trial to allow evaluation of pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy while dosing in already-enrolled patients continues. In total, over 150 patients have been treated with BGB-283 in Australia, New Zealand, and China as of March 25, 2016. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Assets 

&#160; 

Our preclinical pipeline currently consists of targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents including a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, an additional RAF dimer inhibitor, a TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, and a BTK inhibitor for non-oncology indications. We anticipate advancing one or more of our preclinical assets into the clinic in the next 18 months. We believe we have the opportunity to combine our PD-1 monoclonal antibody with other clinical-stage 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and preclinical candidates in our pipeline portfolio to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. We also seek to develop companion diagnostics that will help identify patients that are most likely to benefit from the use of our drug candidates. 

&#160; 

Combination opportunities with our pipeline portfolio to target the cancer immunity cycle 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and their methods of use are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel medicines, as described in more detail below. We have obtained a U.S. patent and filed patent applications in the United States and other countries relating to certain of our drug candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for other of our drug candidates and technologies. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection including our manufacturing processes. 

&#160; 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates and other commercially important products, technologies, inventions and know-how, as well as on our ability to defend and enforce our patents including any patent that we have or may issue from our patent applications, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of other parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and support our development programs. 

&#160; 

As of March 15, 2016, we own four issued U.S. patents and ten pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, we own five pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, which we plan to file nationally in the United States and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

other jurisdictions. With respect to any issued patents in the United States and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting a new drug application approval from the FDA. The patent portfolios for our four leading product candidates as of March 15, 2016 are summarized below: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; BGB-3111. We own three pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to BGB-3111, a small molecule BTK inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Any patents that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire in 2034. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; BGB-A317. We are the owner of one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. application, and corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to BGB-A317, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, and its use for the treatment of cancer. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patent is 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2033. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; BGB-290. We own one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and one pending PCT application directed to BGB-290, a small molecule PARP1/2 inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including glioblastomas and breast cancer. We also own the corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patent is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2031. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; BGB-283. We own one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and one pending PCT application directed to BGB-283, a small molecule BRAF inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including BRAF mutated cancers. We also own pending patent applications in other jurisdictions corresponding to the U.S. patent application. In addition, we plan to file nationally in the U.S. and other jurisdictions based on the pending PCT application. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patent is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2031. If a U.S. application is filed based on the pending PCT application, a patent issuing from that application, if any, would be expected to expire in 2036. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

&#160; 

The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file including the United States, the term of an issued patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened in some cases by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in excess of a patent applicant&#146;s own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. 

&#160; 

In certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country by country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of any patent term extensions or adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The scope of patent protection outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in patents owned by others. Substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in other parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications relating to such areas. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after 18 months from the priority date, and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patents and patent applications relating to drugs similar to our current drug candidates and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already issued or been filed, which could prohibit us from commercializing our product candidates. Specifically, we are aware of certain U.S. patents owned by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. and licensed to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. that are relevant to our BGB-A317 drug candidate. We are also aware of a U.S. patent owned by Pharmacyclics, Inc., which was acquired by AbbVie Inc., that is relevant to our BGB-3111 drug candidate, and certain U.S. patents owned or licensed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., which was acquired by AstraZeneca PLC, that are relevant to our BGB-290 drug candidate. For more information, see &#147;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#148; 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drug candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from others will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 

&#160; 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect aspects of our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

&#160; 

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. The issuance of any patent by others with claims covering or related to aspects of our product candidates would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, redesign our drug candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Such licenses may not be available on reasonable commercial terms or at all, which could require us to cease development or commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our drug candidates would have a material adverse impact on us. If others have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have filed patent applications, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings in the USPTO to determine issues such as 

&#160; 

&#160; 

priority of claimed invention or validity of such patent applications as well as our own patent applications and issued patent. 

&#160; 

For more information on these and other risks related to intellectual property, see &#147;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#148; 

&#160; 

Additionally, we currently use a number of unregistered trademarks and are seeking trademark protection in jurisdictions where available and appropriate. We currently have applications pending in China for BeiGene, and our corporate logo. 

&#160; 

Collaboration with Merck KGaA 

&#160; 

BGB-283 

&#160; 

On May 24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, which we amended and restated on December 10, 2013 and which we refer to respectively as the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement and PRC BRAF Agreement. On October 1, 2015 and December 3, 2015, we further amended the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement. Pursuant to the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement and PRC BRAF Agreement (a) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises its Continuation Option (described below), to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-283, and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit wildtype or certain mutant BRAF, or the Licensed BRAF Inhibitors, in all countries of the world excluding The People&#146;s Republic of China, which we refer to as the Ex-PRC Territory, and (b) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed BRAF Inhibitors in The People&#146;s Republic of China, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to the non-compete restrictions discussed below. 

&#160; 

Under the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement, Merck KGaA has the option to continue such agreement and obtain the exclusive commercialization rights described above in the Ex-PRC Territory, which we refer to as the Continuation Option, by notifying us of such election within 60 days (depending on whether we choose to conduct certain pre-specified Phase 1 clinical trials outside of China) following Merck KGaA&#146;s receipt of the final results reports for the last of certain pre-specified Phase 1 clinical trials that we have retained the responsibility to perform. If Merck KGaA exercises its Continuation Option, it will pay us a continuation fee based on the costs of conducting the relevant trials, subject to a certain cap. If Merck KGaA does not exercise its Continuation Option, the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement will terminate in its entirety except for certain provisions that will survive the termination. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct certain pre-specified Phase 1 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Further, pursuant to the PRC BRAF Agreement, Merck KGaA has an exclusive right of first negotiation to expand its exclusive rights granted under the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement to include the PRC Territory on terms to be mutually agreed in the event we seek to license our intellectual property rights to a third party therein. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement is still in effect, Merck KGaA has the right to do the same in exchange for pre-specified additional milestone payments for certain clinical events in the PRC Territory, but with other financial terms to be mutually agreed. 

&#160; 

Under the Ex-PRC and PRC BRAF Agreements, we received $13 million in non-refundable payments in December 2013 following their execution. As of December 31, 2015, we have received $ 9 million in milestone payments. We are additionally eligible to receive up to $32 million, $33 million and $145 million, respectively, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones in the Ex-PRC Territory, and another $14 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. Merck KGaA also is required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from the mid single-digit to the low-teens, on a country-by-country and Licensed BRAF Inhibitor-by-Licensed BRAF Inhibitor basis, on aggregate net sales of Licensed BRAF Inhibitors in the Ex-PRC Territory.

&#160; 

In consideration for the licenses Merck KGaA grants to us under the PRC BRAF Agreement, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed BRAF Inhibitors in the PRC Territory. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

During the term of the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement, we and our affiliates have agreed not to, alone or with a third-party partner, develop, manufacture, use or sell (i) a product containing a Licensed BRAF Inhibitor in the Ex-PRC Territory or (ii) a product containing a Licensed BRAF Inhibitor other than BGB-283 in the PRC Territory. For clarity, we have retained the rights to develop, manufacture, use or sell any product containing BGB-283 in the PRC Territory. In addition to the rights we have retained for BGB-283 in the PRC Territory (subject to the above Merck KGaA rights), we and our affiliates have retained the ability to develop and commercialize anywhere in the world any compounds that are not the Licensed BRAF Inhibitors, for any use including as inhibitors of wildtype or mutant BRAF. 

&#160; 

The term of the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement continues on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the last to expire of Merck KGaA&#146;s payment obligations to us, unless terminated earlier by either party, and the PRC BRAF Agreement continues unless terminated as permitted by either party. Under each agreement, Merck KGaA has the right to terminate due to our uncured breach or voluntarily upon prior written notice, and Merck KGaA also has a right of first refusal to purchase our interest in the Licensed BRAF Inhibitors (and solely related intellectual property rights) in case of our insolvency and a third party has made an offer to acquire the same. We have the right to terminate these agreements due to Merck KGaA&#146;s uncured breach or for any challenge brought against our licensed patent rights. 

&#160; 

BGB-290 

&#160; 

On October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, which we refer to respectively as the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement and the PRC PARP Agreement, pursuant to which (a) we granted to Merck KGaA an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA exercises a certain continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture our compound BGB-290 and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes, or the Licensed PARP Inhibitors, in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (b) Merck KGaA granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed PARP Inhibitors in the PRC Territory. On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA&#146;s rights under the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement, in consideration for, among other things, a one-time payment of $10 million and reduction of future milestone payments we are eligible for under the PRC PARP Agreement. In connection with such repurchase, we also agreed to provide Merck KGaA with global access to our clinical PARP supplies, including BGB-290, for its combination trials, during the certain option period. The Ex-PRC PARP Agreement was terminated, except for certain provisions therein that are needed to effectuate the continuation of the PRC PARP Agreement, including those provisions that are required in the event that Merck KGaA exercises its PRC Commercialization Option (described below). 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the PRC PARP Agreement, if we fail to achieve national priority project status in the PRC Territory under its 12 th or 13 th five-year plan with respect to our BGB-290 PARP program in the PRC Territory by July 28, 2017, Merck KGaA can exercise its option to acquire exclusive commercialization rights under the BGB-290 PARP program in the PRC Territory, which we refer to as the PRC Commercialization Option. If, however, we do achieve such event by such time, Merck KGaA only has a right of first negotiation to acquire exclusive commercialization rights under the BGB-290 PARP program in the PRC Territory in the event we seek to license our intellectual property rights to a third party therein.

&#160; 

Under the Ex-PRC and PRC PARP Agreements, we received $6 million in non-refundable payments in November 2013 following their execution and $9 million in milestone payments in 2014. We are eligible to receive up to $7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory. In addition, if Merck KGaA exercises the PRC Commercialization Option, Merck KGaA is required to pay us a $50 million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5 million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory. 

&#160; 

Under the PRC PARP Agreement, in consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed PARP Inhibitors in the PRC Territory. 

&#160; 

The PRC PARP Agreement continues unless terminated as permitted by either party. Merck KGaA has the right to terminate due to our uncured breach or for convenience upon prior written notice. We have the right to terminate 

&#160; 

&#160; 

these agreements due to Merck KGaA&#146;s uncured breach or for any challenge brought against our licensed patent rights. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge and industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical companies, and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. 

&#160; 

BGB-3111 Competition 

&#160; 

We are developing BGB-3111, a highly selective small molecule covalent BTK inhibitor, for a variety of B-cell malignancies, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies. 

&#160; 

Janssen/AbbVie&#146;s ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA) is one of the currently approved drugs used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 17p deletion. It has also recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia. 

&#160; 

There are multiple ongoing Phase 3 trials for ibrutinib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics or target therapeutics in various B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s Macroglobulinemia, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. In addition, we are aware of other BTK inhibitors in clinical development for oncology indications, including Celgene&#146;s CC-292 currently in Phase 2 trials, Ono/Gilead&#146;s Ono-4059 currently in Phase 1 trials, and AstraZeneca/Acerta&#146;s ACP-196 currently in Phase 3 trials. 

&#160; 

BGB-A317 Competition 

&#160; 

Two anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody drugs, Merck&#146;s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and BMS&#146;s nivolumab (Opdivo), have been recently approved by the FDA for advanced melanoma patients and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients. Nivolumab has also been approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma patients. 

&#160; 

There are a number of companies with ongoing clinical trials involving an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. Three anti-PD-L1 antibody drugs, Roche&#146;s atezolizumab, AstraZeneca/Celgene&#146;s durvalumab and Pfizer/Merck Serono&#146;s avelumab, together with anti-PD-1 antibodies, Merck&#146;s pembrolizumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s nivolumab, are currently engaged in a number of Phase 2/3 trials, for treatment of multiple cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma and melanoma. Several new anti-PD-1 antibodies have started Phase 1 trials, including AstraZeneca&#146;s MEDI0680, Regeneron&#146;s REGN2810 and Novartis&#146; PDR001. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that are more effective, safer or less costly than our current or future drug candidates, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drug candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products. 

&#160; 

BGB-290 Competition 

&#160; 

AstraZeneca&#146;s Olaparib (LYNPARZA) is approved by the FDA for treating patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with 

&#160; 

&#160; 

three or more prior lines of chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapies. It is approved by the EMA as a maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete response or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

There are a number of companies with ongoing clinical trials, including AstraZeneca, Abbott, Clovis Oncology, Tesaro and Medivation. AstraZeneca&#146;s olaparib has been approved in gBRCAm ovarian cancer and is currently in Phase 3 trials for treatment of gBRCAm breast cancer, gastric cancer, gBRCAm pancreatic cancer and other cancers with sBRCAm or homologous recombinant repair associated genetic mutations. Abbott&#146;s veliparib, in combination with other compound(s), is currently in Phase 3 trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian cancers and glioblastoma multiforme. Clovis Oncology&#146;s rucaparib is currently in Phase 3 trials as a maintenance treatment in patients with platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, Tesaro&#146;s niraparib is currently in Phase 3 trials for platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer and gBRCAm breast cancer, and Medivation&#146;s talazoparib is currently in Phase 3 trials for BRCAm breast cancer. 

&#160; 

BGB-283 Competition 

&#160; 

We are developing BGB-283 as either a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the MAPK pathway including BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS mutations. We intend to develop BGB-283 in various malignancies, including melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancers and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. 

&#160; 

Roche&#146;s vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Novartis&#146; dabrafenib (Tafinlar) are two of the currently approved BRAF inhibitors for treating late-stage BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma. In addition, the combination of dabrafenib and GSK&#146;s trametinib (Mekinist), an MEK inhibitor, is approved in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. We are aware of several other BRAF inhibitors in clinical development targeting BRAF V600E/K mutated cancers including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, hairy cell leukemia and thyroid cancer. These BRAF inhibitors include Array Biopharma&#146;s encorafenib (LGX818), currently in Phase 3 trials, and Takeda MLN-2480 (BIIB-024) and Eli Lilly&#146;s LY3009120, both in Phase 1 trials. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 

&#160; 

Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authority&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, disbarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Regulation 

&#160; 

U.S. Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of drug and biological products such as those we are developing. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. 

&#160; 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

&#160; 

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for a biologic;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a NDA or BLA to file the application for review;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensing of the BLA.

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

&#160; 

Once a pharmaceutical product drug is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

noncompliance, and may be imposed on all products within a certain class of products. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose. 

&#160; 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 

&#160; 

Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 1. &#160; The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labelling.

&#160; 

We refer to our Phase 1 program as dose-escalation and dose-expansion trials. 

&#160; 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator&#146;s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product drug. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. 

&#160; 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product drug and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product drug does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

&#160; 

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. 

&#160; 

The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, and a BLA to determine whether the biologic is safe pure, and potent for its intended use. The FDA also evaluates whether the product&#146;s manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions. 

&#160; 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA or BLA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 

&#160; 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Combination Products in the United States 

&#160; 

Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.

&#160; 

Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the &#147;primary mode of action&#148; of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-drug combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. 

&#160; 

Expedited Programs 

&#160; 

Fast Track Designation 

&#160; 

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs, including biologics, that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. 

&#160; 

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug&#146;s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

&#160; 

Accelerated Approval 

&#160; 

Under FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a biologic, for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than 

&#160; 

&#160; 

clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Breakthrough Designation 

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require the FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug or biologic product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a product be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product&#146;s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product&#146;s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable. 

&#160; 

Priority Review 

&#160; 

Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA or BLA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains their regulatory status (as a drug or biologic, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements, and test each product batch or lot 

&#160; 

&#160; 

prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our drug candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 

&#160; 

The FDA may withdraw a product approval or revoke a biologics license if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our drug candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

&#160; 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 

&#160; 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#160; 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent 

&#160; 

&#160; 

certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity or patent period, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#147;Written Request&#148; for such a clinical trial. 

&#160; 

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 

&#160; 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 

&#160; 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#146;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#146; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drugs 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs, including biologics, intended to treat a rare disease or condition&#151;generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. 

&#160; 

After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee. 

&#160; 

During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. &#147;Same drug&#148; means a drug that contains the same active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or the same principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Information 

&#160; 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, NDAs, BLAs or supplements must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

effective. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 

&#160; 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

&#160; 

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

&#160; 

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 

&#160; 

The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160; 

If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, that requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs and biologics to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

&#160; 

The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 

&#160; 

In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for &#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#146;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Effective in 2011, the Affordable Care Act imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., the &#147;donut hole&#148;).

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Effective in 2011, the Affordable Care Act imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Affordable Care Act required pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any &#147;transfer of value&#148; made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin tracking this information in 2013 and to report this information to CMS beginning in 2014. The reported information was made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website beginning in September 2014.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

&#160; 

PRC Regulation 

&#160; 

In the PRC, we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations relevant to our business and operations. 

&#160; 

General Regulations on China Food and Drug Administration 

&#160; 

In the PRC, the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, as well as medical devices and equipment. The CFDA&#146;s primary responsibility includes evaluating, registering and approving new drugs, generic drugs, imported drugs and traditional Chinese medicines; approving and issuing permits for the manufacture, export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical appliances; approving the establishment of enterprises for pharmaceutical manufacture and distribution; formulating administrative rules and policies concerning the supervision and administration of food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals; and handling significant accidents involving these products. The local provincial drug administrative authorities are responsible for supervision and administration of drugs within their respective administrative regions. 

&#160; 

The PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People&#146;s Congress in 1984 and the Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the Ministry of Health, or the MOH, in 1989 set forth the legal framework for the administration of pharmaceutical products, including the research, development and manufacturing of drugs. 

&#160; 

The PRC Drug Administration Law was revised in December 2001 and again in April 2015. The purpose of the revisions was to strengthen the supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products and to ensure the quality and safety of those products for human use. The revised PRC Drug Administration Law applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, trade, application, supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products. It regulates and prescribes a framework for the administration of pharmaceutical preparations of medical institutions and for the development, research, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

pricing and advertisement of pharmaceutical products. Revised Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the State Council took effect in September 2002, providing detailed implementing regulations for the revised PRC Drug Administration Law. 

&#160; 

Under these regulations, we need to follow related regulations for preclinical research, clinical trials and production of new drugs. 

&#160; 

Good Laboratories Practice Certification for Preclinical Research 

&#160; 

To improve the quality of preclinical research, the CFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for Good Laboratories Practice of Preclinical Laboratory in 2003 and began to conduct the certification program of Good Laboratories Practice, or the GLP. In April 2007, the CFDA issued the Circular on Measures for Certification of Good Laboratory Practice, or CFDA Circular 214, providing that the CFDA is responsible for certification of preclinical research institutions. Under CFDA Circular 214, the CFDA decides whether an institution is qualified for undertaking pharmaceutical preclinical research upon the evaluation of the institution&#146;s organizational administration, its research personnel, its equipment and facilities and its operation and management of preclinical pharmaceutical projects. If all requirements are met, a GLP Certification will be issued by the CFDA and the result will be published on the CFDA&#146;s website. 

&#160; 

Currently for all our ongoing projects, we cooperated with CFDA certified GLP laboratories operated by Wuxi AppTec (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. and JOINN Laboratories (Beijing) to conduct the studies following GLP based on CFDA requirements. 

&#160; 

Approval for Clinical Trials and Production of New Drugs 

&#160; 

According to the Provisions for Drug Registration promulgated by the CFDA in 2007, Drug Administration Law promulgated and amended by the Standing Committee of the National People&#146;s Congress in 2015, Circular on Regulations for Special Approval on New Drug Registration issued by the CFDA in 2009, and Circular on Information Publish Platform for Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials issued by the CFDA in 2013, we must comply with the following procedures and obtain several approvals for clinical trials and production of new drugs. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trial Application 

&#160; 

Upon completion of its preclinical research, a research institution must apply for approval of a Clinical Trial Application before conducting clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Special Examination and Approval for Domestic Category 1 Pharmaceutical Products 

&#160; 

Domestic Category 1 New Drugs Are Eligible for Special Examination and Approval 

&#160; 

According to Provisions for Drug Registration promulgated by the CFDA in 2007, drug registration applications are divided into three different types, namely Domestic New Drug Application, Domestic Generic Drug Application, and Imported Drug Application. Drugs fall into one of three categories, namely chemical medicine, biological product, or traditional Chinese or natural medicine. A Category 1 drug is a new drug that has never been marketed in any country. All of our clinical-stage drug candidates qualify as domestic Category 1 new drugs. 

&#160; 

According to Provisions on the Administration of Special Examination and Approval of Registration of New Drugs, or the Special Examination and Approval Provisions promulgated by the CFDA in July 2009, the CFDA conducts special examination and approval for new drugs registration application when: 

&#160; 

(1) &#160; the chemical raw material medicines as well as the preparations and biological products thereof haven&#146;t been approved for marketing home and abroad;

&#160; 

(2) &#160; the new drugs are for treating AIDS, malignant tumors and rare diseases, etc., and have obvious advantages in clinic treatment; or

&#160; 

(3) &#160; the new drugs are for treating diseases with no effective methods of treatment.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Special Examination and Approval Provisions provide that the applicant may file for special examination and approval at the stage of Clinical Trial Application if the drug candidate falls within item (1). The provisions provide that for drug candidates that fall within items (2) or (3), the application for special examination and approval must be made when filing for production. 

&#160; 

We believe that BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB 290 and BGB-283 fall within items (1) and (2) above. Therefore, we may file an application for special examination and approval at the Clinical Trial Application stage, which may enable us to pursue a more expedited path to approval in China and bring therapies to patients more quickly. 

&#160; 

The Advantages of Category 1 New Drugs over Category 3 Drugs 

&#160; 

Category 3 drugs are new drugs which have already been marketed abroad by multinational companies, but are not yet approved in China. Compared with the application for Category 3 drugs, the application for Category 1 domestic new drugs has a more straight-forward registration pathway. According to Provisions for Drug Registration, where a special examination and approval treatment is granted, the application for clinical trial and manufacturing will be handled with priority and with enhanced communication with the Center for Drug Evaluation of the CFDA, or the CDA, which will establish a working mechanism for communicating with the applicants. If it becomes necessary to revise the clinical trial scheme or make other major alterations during the clinical trial, the applicant may file an application for communication. When an application for communication is approved, the CDA will arrange the communication with the applicant within one month. 

&#160; 

In comparison, according to Provisions for Drug Registration, the registration pathway for Category 3 drugs is complicated and evolving. Category 3 drug applications may only be submitted after a company obtains an NDA approval and receive the CPP granted by a major regulatory authority, such as the FDA or the EMA. Multinational companies may need to apply for conducting MRCTs, which means that companies do not have the flexibility to design the clinical trials to fit the Chinese patients and standard-of-care. Category 3 drug candidates may not qualify to benefit from fast track review with priority at the Clinical Trial Application stage. Moreover, a requirement to further conduct local clinical trials can potentially delay market access by several years from its international NDA approval. Further, according to Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical devices issued by the Chinese State Council, or the State Council, in August 2015, which is a guideline for future legislation and CFDA examination, the drugs which have already been marketed abroad may no longer be categorized as new drugs under the PRC law in the future, and therefore may not be able to enjoy any preferential treatment for new drugs. 

&#160; 

Our drug candidates are all new therapeutic agents and we expect that all of our current drug candidates fall under the Category 1 application process. In July 2015 the CFDA approved our Clinical Trial Application including all phases of clinical trials for BGB-283. We have filed similar Clinical Trial Applications for BGB-3111, BGB-A317 and BGB-290. 

&#160; 

Changes to the Review and Approval Process 

&#160; 

In August 2015, the State Council issued a statement, Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical devices , that contained several potential policy changes that could benefit the pharmaceutical industry: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to accelerate innovative drug approval with a special review and approval process, with a focus on areas of high unmet medical needs, including drugs for HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases, orphan diseases and drugs on national priority lists.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to adopt a policy which would allow companies to act as the marketing authorization holder and to hire contract manufacturing organizations to produce drug products.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A plan to improve the review and approval of clinical trials, and to allow companies to conduct clinical trials at the same time as they are in other countries and encourage local clinical trial organizations to participate in international multi-center clinical trials.

&#160; 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the CFDA released the Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval , which further clarified the following policies potentially simplifying and accelerating the approval process of clinical trials: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A one-time umbrella approval procedure allowing approval of all phases of a new drug&#146;s clinical trials at once, rather than the current phase-by-phase approval procedure, will be adopted for new drugs&#146; clinical trial applications.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following applications: (1) registration of innovative new drugs treating HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases and orphan diseases; (2) registration of pediatric drugs; (3) registration of geriatric drugs and drugs treating China-prevalent diseases; (4) registration of drugs sponsored by national science and technology grants; (5) registration of innovative drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive clinical benefits; (6) registration of foreign innovative drugs to be manufactured locally in China; (7) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the United States or European Union, or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the United States or European Union and are manufactured using the same production line in China; and (8) clinical trial applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within one year.

&#160; 

In February 2016, the CFDA released the Opinions on Priority Review and Approval for Resolving Drug Registration Applications Backlog , which further clarified the following policies potentially accelerating the approval process of certain clinical trials or drug registrations which may benefit us: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following drug registration applications with distinctive clinical benefits: (1) registration of innovative drugs not sold within or outside China; (2) registration of innovative drug transferred to be manufactured in China; (3) registration of drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive treatment advantages; (4) clinical trial applications for drugs patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with patent expiry within one year; (5) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the United States or European Union, or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the United States or European Union and are manufactured using the same production line in China; (6) traditional Chinese medicines (including ethnic medicines) with clear position in prevention and treatment of serious diseases; and (7) registration of new drugs sponsored by national key technology projects or national key development projects.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A fast track drug registration approval pathway will be available for the following drugs registration application with distinctive clinical benefits for prevention and treatment of HIV, phthisis, virus hepatitis, orphan diseases, cancer, children&#146;s diseases, and geriatrics.

&#160; 

In March 2016, the CFDA released a circular, CFDA Announcement on Reforms of Pharmaceutical Registration Classification , which outlined the re-classifications of drug applications. Under the new categorization, innovative drugs that have not been approved either in or outside China remain Category 1, while drugs approved outside China seeking marketing approval in China are now Category 5. 

&#160; 

The CFDA may release detailed policies regarding such abovementioned fast track clinical trial approval and drug registration pathway, and we expect that the CFDA review and approval process will improve over time. However, how and when this approval process will be changed is still subject to further policies to be issued by the CFDA and is currently uncertain. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subsidies and Preferential Tax Treatment for &#147;12-5 Major New Drugs Development Projects&#148; 

&#160; 

In 2012, the State Council adopted a &#147;12-5 Major New Drugs Development Projects,&#148; according to which a special fund was established by the government to encourage the development of new drugs. Our BGB-283 drug candidate and another BRAF preclinical research project have been recognized as &#147;12-5 Major New Drugs Development Projects&#148; and received government subsidies of RMB 6,554,600 during the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and Its Implementation 

&#160; 

The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules permit certain High and New Technologies Enterprises, or HNTEs, to enjoy preferential enterprise income tax rates subject to these HNTEs meeting certain qualification criteria. In April 2008, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High and New Technology Enterprises specifying the criteria and procedures for the certification of HNTEs. In January 2016, revised version of the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High and New Technology Enterprises has been issued by the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Finance and replaced the 2008 version, while the material criteria of HNTEs remains unchanged.

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and effective January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008 and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services. However, if the services provided are related to technological development and transfer, such business tax may be exempted subject to approval by the relevant tax authorities. 

&#160; 

In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax, or the Pilot Plan. Since January 2012, the SAT has been implementing the Pilot Plan, which imposes value-added tax, or VAT, in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. The Pilot Plan was expanded to other regions, including Beijing, in September 2012, and was further expanded nationwide beginning August 1, 2013. VAT is applicable at a rate of 6% in lieu of business taxes for certain services and 17% for the sale of goods and provision of tangible property lease services. VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. 

&#160; 

Four Phases of Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

A clinical development program consists of Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4. Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and safety evaluation studies in humans. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate&#146;s therapeutic effectiveness and safety for particular indication(s) in patients, provide evidence and support for the design of Phase 3 clinical trial, and settle the administrative dose regimen. Phase 3 refers to clinical trials undertaken to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of a drug. Phase 3 is used to further verify the drug&#146;s therapeutic effectiveness and safety on patients with target indication(s), to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug, and ultimately to provide sufficient evidence for the review of drug registration application. Phase 4 refers to a new drug&#146;s post-marketing study to assess therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions when the drug is widely used, to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug when used among general population or specific groups, and to adjust the administration dose, etc. 

&#160; 

New Drug Application 

&#160; 

When Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the clinical trials have been completed, the applicant must apply to the CFDA for approval of a new drug application. The CFDA then determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive evaluation opinion provided by the CDE of the CFDA. We have obtained approval of our Clinical Trial Application for BGB-283 in the PRC, and clinical trials are expected to be initiated. We must obtain approval of a new drug application before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the PRC market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Good Manufacturing Practice 

&#160; 

All facilities and techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in the PRC must be operated in conformity with cGMP guidelines as established by the CFDA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of manufacturing and significant fines. 

&#160; 

Animal Test Permits 

&#160; 

According to Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission in November 1988 and Administrative Measures on the Certificate for Animal Experimentation promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission and other regulatory authorities in January 2001, performing experimentation on animals requires a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals. Applicants must satisfy the following conditions: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Laboratory animals must be qualified and sourced from institutions that have Certificates for Production of Laboratory Animals;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The environment and facilities for the animals&#146; living and propagating must meet state requirements;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The animals&#146; feed and water must meet state requirements;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The animals&#146; feeding and experimentation must be conducted by professionals, specialized and skilled workers, or other trained personnel;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The management systems must be effective and efficient; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The applicable entity must follow other requirements as stipulated by the PRC laws and regulations.

&#160; 

We obtained a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals in 2012 regarding the scope of rats and mice. 

&#160; 

Regulations Relating to Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

Patent 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC and its implementation rules, patents in the PRC fall into three categories, namely invention patent, utility model and design patent. Invention patent refers to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product, method or its improvement; utility model refers to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure or a combination of both of a product; and design patent refers to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern or a combination of both and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the Patent Law of the PRC, the term of patent protection starts from the date the patent was filed. Patents relating to utility-models and designs are effective for ten years from the initial date the patent application was filed. The Patent Law of the PRC adopts the principle of &#147;first to file,&#148; which means where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who first filed the application. 

&#160; 

Existing patents can become invalid or unenforceable due to a number of factors, including known or unknown prior art, deficiencies in patent application and lack of novelty in technology. In the PRC, a patent must have novelty, innovation and practical application. Under the Patent Law of PRC, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in the PRC or abroad or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is published after the filing date. Patents in the PRC are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for a pharmaceutical invention 18 months after the application is filed, which may be shortened upon request by the applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date the application is filed. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Article 20 of the Patent Law of the PRC provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant (not just Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of China, must first submit it to the SIPO for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the subject invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the SIPO has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in the PRC or outsource research and development activities to service providers in the PRC. Currently we have three invention patents published by SIPO and one invention patent under the application process. 

&#160; 

Patent Enforcement 

&#160; 

Unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other infringement acts against patent rights, will subject the infringers to tortious liabilities. Serious offences may be subject to criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

When a dispute arises as a result of infringement of the patent owner&#146;s patent right, PRC law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through consultation between them. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority under the SIPO. A PRC court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner&#146;s or an interested party&#146;s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as either the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement or the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. As in other jurisdictions, with one notable exception, the patent owner in the PRC has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed. However, if the owner of a manufacturing process patent alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proving that it has not infringed. To our knowledge, there are no disputes as to our infringement of any third party&#146;s patent. 

&#160; 

Medical Patent Compulsory License 

&#160; 

According to the Patent Law of the PRC, the SIPO may grant a compulsory license for manufacturing patented drugs and exporting them to countries or regions covered under relevant international treaties to which the People&#146;s Republic of China has acceded. 

&#160; 

Exemptions for Unlicensed Manufacture, Use and Import of Patented Drugs 

&#160; 

According to the Patent Law of the PRC, any person may manufacture, use or import patented drugs for the purpose of providing information required for administrative examination and approval without authorization granted by the patent owner. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets 

&#160; 

According to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, the term &#147;trade secrets&#148; refers to technical information and business information that is unknown to the public, that has utility and may create business interest or profit for its legal owners or holders, and that is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. 

&#160; 

Under this law, business persons are prohibited from employing the following methods to infringe trade secrets: (1) obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by any unfair methods such as stealing, solicitation or coercion; (2) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item (1) above; or (3) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in confidence. If a third party knows or should have known of the above-mentioned illegal conduct but nevertheless obtains, uses or discloses trade secrets of others, the third party may be deemed to have committed a misappropriation of the others&#146; trade secrets. The parties whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may petition for administrative corrections, and regulatory authorities may stop any illegal activities and fine infringing parties in the amount of RMB 10,000&#150;200,000. Alternatively, persons whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may file lawsuits in a PRC court for loss and damages caused by the misappropriation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential. 

&#160; 

Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution 

&#160; 

Foreign Exchange Regulation 

&#160; 

The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008, are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required when R MB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.

&#160; 

In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into R MB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues concerning Further Clarifying and Regulating the Foreign Exchange Administration under Some Capital Accounts, or Circular 45, on November 9, 2011 to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE&#146;s approval, and such RMB capital may not, in any case, be used to repay RMB loans whose proceeds were not used. Furthermore, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues Concerning Strengthening Administration of Foreign Exchange Services in November 2010, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings, such as our initial public offering, and requires, among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in our prospectus or otherwise approved by our board of directors. Violations of these SAFE regulations may result in severe monetary or other penalties, including confiscation of earnings derived from such violation activities, a fine of up to 30% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign invested funds or in the case of a severe violation, a fine ranging from 30% to 100% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign-invested funds.

&#160; 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of R MB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not previously possible. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by the SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC will be conducted by way of registration, and banks must process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.

&#160; 

Under the Circular of the SAFE on Further Improving and Adjusting the Policies for Foreign Exchange Administration under Capital Accounts promulgated by the SAFE on January 10, 2014 and effective from February 10, 2014, administration over the outflow of the profits by domestic institutions has been further simplified. In principle, a bank is no longer required to examine transaction documents when handling the outflow of profits of no more than the equivalent of $50,000 by a domestic institution. When handling the outflow of profits 

&#160; 

&#160; 

exceeding the equivalent of $50,000, the bank, in principle, is no longer required to examine the financial audit report and capital verification report of the domestic institution, provided that it must examine, according to the principle of transaction authenticity, the profit distribution resolution of the board of directors (or the profit distribution resolution of the partners) relating to this profit outflow and the original copy of its tax record-filing form. After each profit outflow, the bank must affix its seal to and endorsements on the original copy of the relevant tax record-filing form to indicate the actual amount of the profit outflow and the date of the outflow. 

&#160; 

On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which became effective on June 1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises may be settled on a discretionary basis, meaning that the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The proportion of such discretionary settlement is temporarily determined as 100%. The R MB converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account, and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make further payment from such account, it still must provide supporting documents and go through the review process with the banks.

&#160; 

Furthermore, SAFE Circular 19 stipulates that the use of capital by foreign-invested enterprises must adhere to the principles of authenticity and self-use within the business scope of enterprises. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes: 

&#160; 

(1) &#160; directly or indirectly used for the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations;

&#160; 

(2) &#160; directly or indirectly used for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations;

&#160; 

(3) &#160; directly or indirectly used for granting the entrusted loans in RMB, unless permitted by the scope of business, repaying the inter-enterprise borrowing (including advances by the third party), or repaying the bank loans in RMB that have been sub-lent to the third party; and/or

&#160; 

(4) &#160; paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises.

&#160; 

Our PRC subsidiaries&#146; distributions to the offshore parent and carrying out cross-border foreign exchange activities shall comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above. 

&#160; 

Share Option Rules 

&#160; 

Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the People&#146;s Bank of China on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or Share Option Rules, issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (1) register with the SAFE or its local branches; (2) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants; and (3) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation of Dividend Distribution 

&#160; 

The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, and the Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Labor Laws and Social Insurance 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations. 

&#160; 

In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds. 

&#160; 

Rest of the World Regulation 

&#160; 

For other countries outside of the United States and the PRC, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160; 

We lease an approximately 140 square meter manufacturing facility in Beijing, PRC, which produces and supplies preclinical and clinical trial materials for some of our small molecule drug candidates. In addition, we expect to lease an 11,000 square meter space to build manufacturing facility in Suzhou, PRC. At the Suzhou manufacturing facility, we intend to produce drug candidates for clinical or, in the future, commercial use. We expect this facility to consist of one oral-solid-dosage production line for small molecule drug products and one pilot plant for monoclonal antibody drug substances. We also outsource to a limited number of external service providers the production of some drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our drug candidates. For example, cell line and process development for BGB-A317 was completed by Boehringer Ingelheim, which is currently manufacturing BGB-A317 in China. We do not have a long-term agreement with these third parties. We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short-term, project-by-project basis. 

&#160; 

Currently, we obtain drug raw materials for our manufacturing activities from multiple suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, a risk exists that an interruption supplies would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements governing record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality 

&#160; 

&#160; 

assurance, among others. Our manufacturing facilities and the contract manufacturing organizations we use to manufacture our drug candidates operate under cGMP conditions. cGMP are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. For most of our manufacturing processes a back-up cGMP manufacturer is in place or can easily be identified. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 192 full-time employees and two part-time employees. Of these, 149 were engaged in full-time research and development and laboratory operations and 43 were engaged in full-time general and administrative functions. As of December 31, 2015, 187 of our employees were located in the PRC, six were located in the United States, and one was located in Australia. We have also engaged and may continue to engage independent contractors to assist us with our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160; 

Glossary of Scientific Terms 

&#160; 

As used in this Annual Report, the scientific terms set forth below shall have the following meanings: 

&#160; 

ADCC 

Means antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ALK 

Means anaplastic lymphoma kinase, an enzyme encoded in humans by the ALK gene. ALK mutations are associated with certain lung cancers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ATM 

Means ataxia telangiectasia mutated, a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in response to DNA damage. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

BRAF 

Means a human gene that makes the B-raf protein involved in sending internal cell signals that direct cell growth. In cells expressing mutant BRAF V600E and in conditions of low RAS-GTP, all RAF isoforms exist predominantly as monomers. However, unlike wild-type RAFs, monomeric BRAF V600E is hyperactive. Under conditions where RAS is activated or other BRAF induced resistance, RAF isoforms form dimers (two copies of RAF proteins bind together). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

B-cell 

Means a type of white blood cell that differs from other lymphocytes like T-cells by the presence of the BCR on the B-cell&#146;s outer surface. 

&#160;
