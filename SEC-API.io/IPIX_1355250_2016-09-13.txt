 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS 

&#160;

Cellceutix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies with oncology, dermatology and antimicrobial applications. Cellceutix owns the rights to numerous drug compounds, including Kevetrin (thioureidobutyronitrile), our lead anti-cancer compound; Prurisol (KM-133), which is in development for psoriasis; and Brilacidin, our lead drug in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics.

&#160;

The Company devotes most of its efforts and resources advancing its compounds already in clinical trials. We anticipate using our expertise to manage and perform what we believe are the most critical aspects of the product development process which include: (i) design and oversight of clinical trials; (ii) development and execution of strategies for the protection and maintenance of intellectual property rights; and (iii) interactions with regulatory authorities domestically and internationally. We expect to concentrate on product development and engage in a limited way in product discovery, avoiding the significant investment of time and financial resources that is generally required for a promising compound to be identified and brought into clinical trials.

&#160;

At this time the Company is focusing its research and development efforts on its compounds Kevetrin, Prurisol, and Brilacidin, and to a lesser extent on our other anti-bacterial and anti-fungal compounds:

&#160;

&#183; Kevetrin . Kevetrin, our lead anti-cancer compound, is a small molecule compound that induces activation of p53, a protein involved in controlling cell mutations. In nearly all cancers, regardless of origin, the p53 pathway is muted from performing its anti-tumor functions. Pre-clinical research has demonstrated Kevetrin&#8217;s unique mechanism of action to induce apoptosis, slow tumor progression and reduce tumor volume in many types of cancers, including lung, breast, colon, prostate, squamous cell carcinoma and a leukemia tumor model. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has awarded Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for Kevetrin for retinoblastoma and Orphan Drug designation for pancreatic cancer. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Prurisol . Prurisol, our lead anti-psoriasis drug candidate, is a small molecule compound acting on the principles of immune modulation and PRINS ( P soriasis susceptibility-related R NA Gene In duced by S tress) reduction that has been found to be effective against psoriasis in animal models, both in induced psoriasis as well as a xenograft model with human psoriatic tissue. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Brilacidin . Brilacidin is our lead drug in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics (also called host defense protein (HDP)-mimetics), which are a completely new class of antibacterial and anti-fungal small molecule compounds modeled after host defense proteins. Because defensin-mimetics can kill pathogens swiftly and thoroughly in the same manner as the human immune system, they can significantly reduce the risk of drug resistance developing. In addition, Brilacidin-OM, an oral rinse formulation, has shown antibacterial, anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties, which we believe can address a significant unmet medical need and pharmacoeconomic rationale to treat cancer patients with oral mucositis. Oral mucositis, a common and often debilitating inflammation and ulceration that occurs in the mouth as a side-effect of certain cancer treatments, afflicts approximately 450,000 patients each year in the U.S., increasing treatment costs and affecting the course and outcome of cancer therapy. The FDA awarded a Fast Track designation to Brilacdin-OM for oral mucositis in November 2015. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Other compounds . Independently, and through collaborative relationships with leading universities and institutions supported by funding through government grants, Cellceutix is developing defensin-mimetics for a wide range of indications, including otic infections, diabetic foot infections, hidradenitis suppurativa and some of the most difficult to treat multi-drug resistant fungal infections and bacterium where there is a significant and growing medical need for new therapies. 

&#160;

We are a clinical stage company. We have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product revenue until we receive approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies to begin marketing a pharmaceutical product. Developing pharmaceutical products, however, is a lengthy and very expensive process. Assuming we do not encounter any unforeseen safety or efficacy issues during the course of developing our product candidates, we do not expect to complete the development of a product candidate for several years, if ever.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s stock symbol is &#8220;CTIX&#8221; and is quoted on the OTCQB.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

We are in the business of developing and/or acquiring innovative small molecule therapies to treat diseases with significant medical need. Our strategy is to use our business and scientific expertise to maximize the value of our diverse pipeline. We expect to develop the highest quality data and broadest intellectual property to support our compounds. 

&#160;

We currently own all development and marketing rights to our investigational products. In order to successfully develop and market our products, we may have to partner with other companies. Prospective partners may require that we grant them significant development and/or commercialization rights in return for agreeing to share the risk of development and/or commercialization.

&#160;

The work plan we have developed for the next twelve (12) months is expected to support our clinical trials. If we find that we have underestimated the time duration or cost of our studies or if we have to undertake additional studies, due to various reasons within or outside of our control, our development timelines and/or our financing needs may be significantly impacted. 

&#160;

We are an early stage developmental pharmaceutical company. The Company has no customers, commercial products or revenues to date, and may never achieve revenues or profitable operations.

&#160;

Pipeline Summary 

&#160;

Compound: Kevetrin 

Disease: Cancer

&#160;

Kevetrin 

&#160;

Kevetrin, our anti-cancer drug candidate, has completed a Phase 1 study at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (&#8220;BIDMC&#8221;). The clinical trial evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of Kevetrin in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors of various types. The primary endpoints for the study were safety, determining the maximum tolerated dose, and establishing the dose for future Phase 2 clinical trials.

&#160;

Exposure to Kevetrin as measured by plasma concentrations have been achieved which are greater than concentrations shown to induce apoptosis in non-clinical studies. While the trial is primarily to evaluate safety of repeated cycles of Kevetrin, it is encouraging that some patients have had stabilization of tumor status during treatment. Further, Kevetrin appears to be having the expected effects on p53 in a number of the patients treated, as measured by increases in the levels of the downstream protein p21 biomarker.

&#160;

The Phase 1 trial of Kevetrin trial yielded data validating the safety of Kevetrin and suggestive evidence of the potential clinical benefit of Kevetrin in patients who had relapsed after other cancer treatments. Because of the relatively short half-life of Kevetrin in plasma, it is the Company&#8217;s belief that administering Kevetrin multiple times per week may have an even greater clinical benefit in the planned Phase 2 trial in patients with ovarian cancer. 

&#160;

Pharmacokinetic profiles found that Kevetrin has a relatively short biological half-life (less than 2 hours) in plasma. Plasma half-life (T 1/2 ) clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) suggest that drug elimination predominantly involves hepatic mechanisms and Kevetrin undergoes rapid extensive distribution from systemic circulation into tissues. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data, as measured by area under the curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) levels, further revealed that Kevetrin exhibited a dose-dependent response, has as stated a relatively short half-life (approximately 2 hours) and clears the body within one day - on average between 8 and 10 hours - though the drug can remain in the body up to approximately 24 hours, depending upon individual patient variations.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160;

When the duration of the treatment of a disease is shorter than the therapeutic activity of drug, single doses are given. After a single dose IV infusion administration, plasma drug concentration levels rise above and then fall below the minimum effective concentration (MEC - the minimum plasma drug concentration required to produce a desired pharmacological effect in most patients) resulting in decline in therapeutic effect. To treat cancer, multiple IV infusion regimens are required to maintain the plasma drug levels above the MEC, but below the minimum toxic concentration to achieve optimal clinical effectiveness.

&#160;

Ideally, a dosage regimen is established for each drug to provide the correct plasma level without excessive fluctuation and drug accumulation outside the therapeutic window. Kevetrin has less than a two-hour half-life. PK results indicate that, with the current dose regimen, Kevetrin is almost completely out of plasma within 24 hours. Therefore, little drug remains for any substantial period of time afterwards. 

&#160;

Based on these findings, we believe the impact of Kevetrin when administered to patients with repeated dosing (3 times per week), as planned in the upcoming ovarian cancer trial, will achieve fairly steady levels of Kevetrin above the MEC. The sustained activation/modulation of p53 will modulate multiple signaling pathways and should substantially increase its therapeutic efficacy. As noted above, Kevetrin is administered as an intravenous therapy (IV). The Company is now researching other formulations (e.g., oral). 

&#160;

In February 2016, Cellceutix met with FDA Division of Oncology Products 1 to discuss Kevetrin&#8217;s Phase 1 study data, as well as a proposed design for a planned Phase 2 trial in patients with ovarian cancer resistant to platinum-based therapy. The FDA was agreeable to Cellceutix&#8217;s plan to initiate such a trial, and based upon the data from the Phase 1 trial, that the administration of Kevetrin doses at three times per week would be acceptable. 

&#160;

Kevetrin was granted FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer.

&#160;

Kevetrin was granted FDA Rare Disease Designation for Kevetrin for the treatment of pediatric retinoblastoma.

&#160;

In 2012, we entered into an agreement with BIDMC, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, on an innovative research project with Kevetrin. BIDMC wishes to exploit the nuclear and/or mitochondrial pro-apoptotic function of p53 in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, two types of cancer that are particularly resistant to therapy. We anticipate engaging in advanced discussions with the hospital when we have more resources as to the logistics and costs, net of grants, to move this project forward into Phase 2 studies of renal cell carcinomas. 

&#160;

After testing Kevetrin in preclinical studies, the University of Bologna in Italy (the "University") and The Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (ICSG on CML) and Acute Leukemia (GIMEMA Group) approached us to test Kevetrin in a clinical trial against Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). The study proposed is a Phase 2 trial evaluating Kevetrin as a single agent or in combination with cytarabine in patients with AML. The protocol was submitted in May 2015 by the Principal Investigator to the institutional review committee. In October 2015, we were advised by the Principal Investigator that there are difficulties with the funding in Italy and he asked whether we would be interested in contributing financially to the study. We have requested budgets and timelines to help us with the decision making process as we are interested in engaging in clinical trials for the use of Kevetrin in leukemias. We intend to address this potential project once we are engaged in the ovarian cancer study and have available to us additional capital and resources.

&#160;

Compound: Prurisol (KM-133) 

Disease: Psoriasis

&#160;

Prurisol is our anti-psoriasis drug candidate. It is a small molecule compound with a molecular weight of less than 500 MW. It is synthesized through a multi-step process using commercially available starting materials. Prurisol acts through immune modulation and PRINS reduction.

&#160;

Prurisol was studied in mice that were irradiated then engrafted with human psoriatic tissue. Groups of ten mice were treated orally for 14 days with either 10 mg/kg KM-133 once/day, 10 mg/kg KM-133 twice/day, 7.5 mg/kg methotrexate once/day or acted as controls. The mice were followed for 180 days. Endpoints were skin appearance, histological observations, and blood levels of PRINS and IL-20. For these parameters, Prurisol treatment was compared to controls and methotrexate. CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts were also measured and compared to efalizumab. It significantly reduced all psoriatic endpoints measured relative to controls (p&#60;0.01). The higher dose of Prurisol reduced psoriatic endpoints more than methotrexate (p&#60;0.01). In addition, there was no recurrence of psoriasis in animals treated with Prurisol, whereas psoriasis recurred after an average of 61 days in animals treated with methotrexate. Immunosuppression in animals treated with Prurisol was less severe than in those treated with efalizumab. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160;

In August 2015, we commenced a Phase 2 trial of Prurisol, an orally administered small molecule for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. We are developing Prurisol under FDA guidance that a 505(b)(2) drug approval pathway is an acceptable pathway for its development. This offers the benefits of a faster development process. Prurisol is eligible because it is metabolized to abacavir, which is the active moiety in the marketed drug Ziagen (abacavir sulfate). Given that psoriasis is a chronic condition with limited effective therapies that the National Psoriasis Foundation lists as affecting 125 million people worldwide, we see a tremendous market opportunity for an effective new oral treatment. 

&#160;

On May 24, 2016, the Company released top line data on its Phase 2a FDA trial for orally-administered Prurisol in the treatment of mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis. The trial enrolled 115 patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, graded at a score of 2 (&#8220;mild&#8221;) or 3 (&#8220;moderate&#8221;) on the 5-point Investigator&#8217;s Global Assessment (IGA) scale. The IGA scale ranges from a score of 0 (&#8220;clear&#8221;) to a score of 4 (&#8220;severe&#8221;). The 12-week trial was structured with four arms, three receiving different dosing regimens of oral Prurisol (50mg, 100mg, 200mg) and one placebo arm. The primary endpoint was a 2-point reduction in the IGA score at Day 84.

&#160;

The trial achieved its primary endpoint in patients treated with 200mg of oral Prurisol. Among the most severe psoriasis patients participating in the study, those having a baseline IGA score of 3 (&#8220;moderate&#8221;), the primary endpoint was met in 46.2% of patients who received Prurisol 200mg. These data were derived from analyses of all patients randomized across all 9 participating study sites. Additional preliminary data analyses of secondary endpoints showed patients who received any dose of Prurisol, regardless of the treatment arm, had a 1-point improvement (using the IGA scoring system) at a higher rate than that of patients in the placebo arm. This was another indication of the drug&#8217;s efficacy. Increases in Prurisol&#8217;s therapeutic response, upon evaluating patients at Day 56 (Week 8) and Day 84 (Week 12) of treatment, also were apparent in the Prurisol 200mg arm, suggesting an improving response over time. In light of Prurisol&#8217;s greater efficacy in treating moderate psoriasis cases, the Company expects the next clinical trial of Prurisol will target patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with an optimal dosing regimen continuing to be assessed. The study&#8217;s anticipated daily dosing will be treatments of 300mg and 400mg.

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin 

Brilacidin is in a new class of drugs called defensin-mimetics. Defensin-mimetics are non-peptide small molecule compounds modeled after host defense proteins, which represent the front-line of defense in the human immune system. It has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Because Brilacidin destroys bacteria in the same manner as the body naturally does, it can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial resistance.

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin 

Disease: Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection (ABSSSI)

&#160;

The intravenous formulation of our lead antibiotic candidate, Brilacidin, has the potential to treat a variety of infections, including ABSSSI, caused by drug-sensitive or drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by other Gram-positive bacteria.

&#160;

The Phase 2b trial entitled "A Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Three Dosing Regimens of Brilacidin to Daptomycin in the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI)" completed enrollment in August 2014. On October 23, 2014, we announced positive top-line efficacy data from this Phase 2b ABSSSI trial, and on January 5, 2015, we reported the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

&#160;

In July 2015, at an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting, Cellceutix and FDA discussed data supporting advancement of Brilacidin into Phase 3, as well as the basic elements of a Phase 3 program in ABSSSI. This is the first Host Defense Protein (HDP) mimic to advance through Phase 2. Because HDP mimics, such as Brilacidin, represent an entirely new class of antibiotics, there is no potential cross-resistance with currently marketed antibiotics, and due to its unique mechanism of action, resistance to Brilacidin is unlikely to develop. For this and other reasons, such as its high activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a leading cause of ABSSSI), Brilacidin received designation as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) in November 2014. The QIDP designation was established as part of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in July 2012, for the purpose of encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobial drugs to treat serious and life-threatening infections. Receiving QIDP designation means that Brilacidin is now eligible for additional FDA incentives in the approval and marketing path, including Fast Track designation and Priority Review for development and a five-year extension of market exclusivity.

&#160;

The Phase 3 ABSSSI program would include two Phase 3 ABSSSI studies, as required by FDA Guidance (October 2013), of approximately 700 subjects in each study. The two studies may enroll subjects simultaneously. In addition, the first study would include an interim analysis after a portion of the patients has been enrolled. This would provide an early assessment of both safety and efficacy.

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160;

We had submitted our Phase 3 protocol under a Special Protocol Assessment (&#8220;SPA&#8221;) request to the FDA. A SPA is a written agreement between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a drug sponsor detailing the clinical trial design, endpoints and other clinical trial facets that can be used to support regulatory approval, thereby potentially reducing the risk of bringing a drug to market. Obtaining SPA designation from the FDA is an important step as it reinforces the potential of a promising drug in clinical development. The SPA agreement delineates key statistical and clinical endpoint requirements, streamlining the process toward a product gaining FDA approval should the agreed upon criteria and outcomes be met. The SPA process itself can be iterative in nature. In fact, according to industry data, 78 percent of SPAs require multiple review cycles and an average of three months to finalize the SPA.

&#160;

The Phase 3 protocol SPA request included specific questions from Cellceutix to facilitate a meaningful dialogue with the FDA on the proposed study design. We have received from the FDA comments and considerations for incorporation into our study design. We are now preparing our response. Additional rounds of review may occur, which can extend the review period and be beneficial in reaching agreement with the FDA on design elements. Based on the FDA&#8217;s feedback, we may reach final agreement with FDA or may decide to incorporate the advice into the design of the Phase 3 clinical study without undergoing additional rounds of review. FDA&#8217;s assessment of the SPA request, and all related feedback, are valuable in the development of Brilacidin for ABSSSI. Contingent upon the outcome of the forgoing SPA request, a U.S. and international study [may] be initiated.

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin 

Disease: Oral Mucositis (OM)

&#160;

In animal models of oral mucositis induced by chemoradiation, topically applied Brilacidin was shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of severe ulcerative oral mucositis by more than 90% compared to placebo. Brilacidin and related compounds have shown antibacterial, anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties in various pre-clinical studies. We believe that the combination of these attributes contributed to the efficacy of Brilacidin in these animal studies.

&#160;

The Company is engaged in a clinical trial titled a "Phase 2, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Brilacidin Oral Rinse Administered Daily for 7 Weeks in Attenuating Oral Mucositis in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer Receiving Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy". Trial recruitment is slower then what was projected by the hospitals we engaged. We believe this is happening because there are numerous competing trials for a limited patient population of head and neck cancer patients who meet the strict trial inclusion and exclusion requirements. To help hasten the completion of the study we have replaced our previous contract research organization (CRO) with another that has a proven track record in clinical trials for this indication. In addition, we brought on Dr. Steven Sonis, an expert in the treatment of OM, as an advisor, and are engaged in the opening of additional sites, to hasten completion of this trial.

&#160;

OM represents a great area of unmet medical need and is potentially a very important and valuable asset in the Brilacidin development program.

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin 

Disease: Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ), Ulcerative Proctitis / Colitis

&#160;

Given its unique immunomodulatory properties, we have also identified inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ), and inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) diseases as an indication for treatment with Brilacidin. We are now engaged in an open-label Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept (P-o-C) trial of Brilacidin for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative proctitis (UP) / ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS) in Europe.

&#160;

The primary objective of the P-o-C trial is to assess the frequency of clinical and endoscopic remission with Brilacidin administered per rectum in subjects with active UP or UPS after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability of Brilacidin when administered per rectum, evaluation of clinical remission at Week 2 and Week 4, assessment of systemic exposure and/or pharmacokinetics of Brilacidin when administered per rectum, assessment of the efficiency of Brilacidin by biomarker evaluation of biopsy samples for interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta, and estimation of statistical power for subsequent trial(s) in UP and UPS.

&#160;

The P-o-C trial will include 18 patients divided evenly into three cohorts. Cohort A is receiving 50 milligrams (mg) of Brilacidin once daily for 42 days. Dosing will be increased to 100mg and 200mg once daily for 42 days for Cohort B and Cohort C, respectively. Endoscopic evaluation of the rectum and mucosa up to 40 cm from the anal verge will be performed at screening and at the end of treatment/Day 42 (&#177; 3 days). Per protocol, a safety committee will review safety and retention data (clinical laboratory findings, vital signs and adverse events) after 21 days of therapy for all six patients in each cohort before proceeding with initiating enrollment in the subsequent cohort.

&#160;

The trial is using Brilacidin in a water base administered by enema. However, a commercial product will need a different formulation (i.e. Brilacidin in foam). Additional formulation development is needed for each indication.

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin or Other HDP Mimics 

Disease: Hidradenitis Suppurativa

&#160;

Again, due to the unique immunomodulatory properties of the HDP mimics, along with inherent antimicrobial activity, the Company has plans to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of topical HDP mimic for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Also known as acne inversa, HS is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent abscesses and formation of sinus tracts, typically where skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. First described 176 years ago, there still is no cure and only limited effective treatment options. Reports of prevalence range widely from approximately one-half a percent up to approximately four percent of the general population. HS presents in many forms, and though considered an inflammatory condition, bacteria may play a role. In fact, studies have shown a number of hard-to-treat bacterial species are commonly isolated from HS lesions--bacteria our novel compounds are active against. Cellceutix completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA for initiating an HS clinical trial. The Company plans to advance this program upon review of results in our clinical oral mucositis trial and UP trial. 

&#160;

Compound: Brilacidin or Other HDP Mimics 

Topical Applications, Otic Infections and Related Formulation Work

&#160;

The Company has made a significant breakthrough in the formulation of Brilacidin. Previously, Brilacidin could only be stored in a refrigerated state. The Company has now developed a formulation of Brilacidin to be stable at room temperature. However, further formulation work is still needed for each indication. Upon developing optimal formulations, the Company plans to advance these drugs into the clinic. 

&#160;

Cellceutix is conducting preclinical experiments on topical Brilacidin for use in ear-related infections, such as otitis externa or draining otitis media. Studies are now ongoing at a major U.S. university with significant expertise in ototoxic studies. Should these studies be successful, the Company will plan for clinical trials. We believe there is a significant financial opportunity in pursuing this market as there is an unmet medical need for an otic drug to treat MRSA infections. We are less likely to be effected by generic competition due to Brilacidin&#8217;s MRSA and anti-inflammatory properties.

&#160;

Advancing the Platform and Developing Compounds with Activity Against Gram-Negative Bacteria and Fungi 

&#160;

Also in our antibiotic/antifungal portfolio, we are actively testing several of our compounds both in house and through research grants at major universities. In the Gram-negative program, our lead compounds are active in laboratory testing against some of the most problematic pathogens, such as Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. coli and Acinetobacter . We have compounds active against drug-susceptible strains as well as multi-drug resistant strains that produce Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase (KPC). These are also called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE has been identified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as an &#8220;urgent threat&#8221; to public health. Importantly, several of our compounds have been shown to be active against CRE in the laboratory. These results were reported in an oral presentation at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen in May 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160;

In our anti-fungal program, we have identified a series of HDP mimics that are highly active against Candida species and exhibit very low cytotoxicity against mammalian cell types. Additional studies of our HDP mimics suggest possible new treatments for other fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus strains. 

&#160;

Other 

&#160;

In addition to their antimicrobial activity, we are evaluating the use of current and future host defense protein (HDP) mimics for disorders of barrier function, where the innate immune system plays a vital role. For these disorders, the goal is to exploit the anti-inflammatory and anti-biofilm properties to restore and maintain healthy skin and mucous membranes, and to treat refractory biofilm-related infections on natural and artificial surfaces. This would include inflammatory or trauma-related conditions of the skin, eyes, GI tract, and respiratory mucosa; exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis; and infections of catheters, valves, and prosthetic joints

Category 5 - Prurisol and related compounds 

&#160;

We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality and non-use agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our patent strategy is designed to facilitate commercialization of our current and future product candidates, and create barriers to entry.

&#160;

Impairment of Patents 

&#160;

In the latter part of April 2016, the Company wrote off its patent rights to Delparantag. Delparantag was acquired by Cellceutix in the purchase of assets from the Polymedix Estate. The Company believes the compound which had clinical activity but also safety concerns in a prior clinical trial by Polymedix, is now a low priority compound for further development among the compounds in the Company&#8217;s portfolio. The decision by management was made after factoring in today&#8217;s regulatory and litigious climate. The Company recorded impairment loss on the patent costs of Delparantag and for various patents totaling approximately of $648,000 (i.e. the cost of $782,000 less $134,000 of accumulated amortization) in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year end June 30, 2016.

&#160;

Payments Related to Assignment of Compounds 

&#160;

The Company has been assigned all rights, title, and interest to the following eight pharmaceutical compounds: Kevetrin, KM 277, KM 278, Prurisol, KM 362, KM 3174, KM 732, and KM-391. The Company agreed to pay the assignors 5% of net sales of the compounds in countries where composition of matter patents have been issued and 3% of net sales in other countries. Kevetrin, KM 277, KM 278 and KM 362 were acquired by the Company from Dr. Krishna Menon, the Company&#8217;s Director, CSO, and principal shareholder. With regard only to Kevetrin, the allocation of the 5% of net sales would be as follows: 2% to Dr. Menon (President), 2% to an unaffiliated third party, and 1% to Leo Ehrlich, our CEO. With respect to KM 732, the Company has agreed to pay an individual a fixed payment if the compound is approved for sale in the U.S.

&#160;

&#160; 13 

&#160;

MANUFACTURING 

&#160;

The Company does not intend to establish manufacturing capabilities or facilities to produce its drug product candidates (compounds) in the near or mid-term. The Company believes it can contract with third parties for the manufacturing of its investigational compounds at sites registered with the FDA and contract with third-party scientists for pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies. Such studies generally must be completed prior to filing an IND with the FDA, and an IND is necessary to begin the human safety and efficacy trials of its compounds (Phase 1, 2 and 3).

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, distribution, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our investigational products. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, which is our primary initial focus, we anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. 

&#160;

Development and Approval 

&#160;

Product development and the product approval process are very expensive and time consuming, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approval for any of our drug product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Under the FDCA, the FDA must approve any new drug before it can be sold in the United States. The general process for obtaining FDA approval of a drug is as follows: 

&#160;

Preclinical Testing 

&#160;

Before we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must develop extensive preclinical data, generally derived from laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animals, to generate data to support the drug&#8217;s quality and potential safety and benefits. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal Welfare Act. Presently we have a number of compounds that are in preclinical testing.

&#160;

We submit this preclinical data and other information to the FDA in an IND. Human clinical trials cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. Based on the data and information contained in the IND, the FDA must determine whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug candidate in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA.

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

Once the IND goes into effect, we study an investigational drug in human clinical trials to determine if the drug is safe and effective for a particular use. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA&#8217;s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. FDA reviews each protocol that is submitted to the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and, if necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if the agency deems such inspection necessary.

&#160;

In general, clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years to complete, and are very expensive. These three phases are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 14 

&#160;

Phase 1. The investigational drug is given to a small number of human subjects to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In most disease states Phase 1 studies are performed in healthy volunteers. In cancer, Phase 1 studies generally are performed in cancer patients.

&#160;

Phase 2. The investigational drug is given to a limited patient population to determine the initial effect of the drug in treating the disease, the best dose of the drug, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically are controlled studies. 

&#160;

Phase 3. If Phase 2 clinical trials of a compound yield promising data regarding safety and effectiveness, the compound may be advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials to confirm those results. Phase 3 clinical trials typically are long-term, involve a significantly larger population of patients, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions, and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug and to form the basis for labeling. It is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in Phase 2 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and reliable Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160;

At any point in this process, the development of a drug could be stopped for a number of reasons, including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting, or any that we conduct in the future, will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA or an IRB may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if, for example, it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials, and data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent further development and regulatory approval.

&#160;

FDA Approval Process 

&#160;

If we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and effectiveness, we will file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug for a particular use. When an NDA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. 

&#160;

Upon accepting the NDA for filing, the FDA will review the NDA and may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors considers key questions regarding the drug. This advisory committee makes a recommendation to the FDA, which is not binding on the FDA, but is generally followed. 

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the company&#8217;s request or by the agency&#8217;s initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities for the drug, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us and including foreign establishments that may manufacture the product for sale in the U.S., comply with cGMP requirements (described below) and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.

&#160;

If the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, the FDA typically issues a Complete Response letter communicating the agency&#8217;s decision not to approve the application and outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The Complete Response letter also may request further information, including additional preclinical or clinical data or improvements to manufacturing processes, procedures, or facilities. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval.

&#160;

The FDA may reject an application because, among other reasons, it believes that the drug is not safe enough, or effective enough, or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the disease or condition the drug is intended to address, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.

&#160;

&#160; 15 

&#160;

If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and effectiveness for a particular use, it will approve the NDA, allowing the Company to sell the drug in the United States for that use. As a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug. For example, the FDA could require post-approval commitments, including completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as &#8220;Phase 4&#8221; or &#8220;post-marketing&#8221; studies. The FDA also may limit the scope of the approved uses of the drug. Certain post-approval modifications to the drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval.

&#160;

Should our products be approved for marketing, we would also be subject to various other State and Federal laws concerning the marketing and cost reimbursement of our products.

&#160;

Major jurisdictions outside the United States, such as the European Union, Japan and Canada, have similarly rigorous regulatory processes. They may also require studies not required by the FDA, which can add to the cost and risk of development. Products approved by the FDA might not be approved in these other countries. After review by the health authorities, pricing and cost reimbursement are also subject to separate approvals in many of these countries.

&#160;

Post-Approval Regulation 

&#160;

Even if regulatory approval is granted, a marketed drug product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a drug or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. The FDA or similar agencies in other countries may also require labeling changes to products at any time based on new safety information. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA or similar agencies in other countries may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would suspend marketing or approval.

&#160;

Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. If, after approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for advertising, promotion to physicians and patients, communications regarding unapproved uses, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and other restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and state authorities, as well as civil and criminal fines and agreements that may materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.

&#160;

Other Requirements. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, submitting establishment registrations and drug listings, and maintaining certain records.

&#160;

Hatch-Waxman Act 

&#160;

Drugs that are approved for commercial marketing in the U.S. under an NDA are subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act.&#8221; The Hatch-Waxman Act established two abbreviated approval pathways, including the 505(b)(2) pathway, for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products. We are utilizing advantages in this 505(b)(2) pathway for the development of Prurisol. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides companies with marketing exclusivity for new chemical entities, allows companies to apply to extend for up to five additional years of patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA, and provides for a period of marketing exclusivity for products that are not new chemical entities if the NDA (or supplemental NDA) contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. It also provides a means for approving generic versions of a drug product once the marketing exclusivity period has ended and all relevant patents have expired or have been successfully challenged and defeated. The laws of other key markets likewise create both opportunities for exclusivity periods and patent protections and the possibility of generic competition once such periods or protections have either expired or have been successfully challenged by generic entrants.

&#160;

&#160; 16 

&#160;

Orphan Drug Exclusivity 

&#160;

The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. at the time of the request for orphan designation. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other applicable requirements, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. In November 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to Kevetrin for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for clinical testing expenses and exemption from user fees. A drug candidate that is approved for the orphan drug designated use typically is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.

&#160;

Pediatric Exclusivity 

&#160;

Section 505A of the FDCA provides for six months of additional exclusivity if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be safe and effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months.

&#160;

Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity 

&#160;

The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act amended the FDCA to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobial drugs to treat serious and life-threatening infections. Among other measures, GAIN grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity for new antibacterial or antifungal human drugs designated under the law as a &#8220;qualified infectious disease product&#8221; (QIDP). This five-year period of exclusivity is in addition to any existing regulatory exclusivity, including Hatch-Waxman, orphan drug, or pediatric exclusivity. In addition, QIDPs are eligible for fast-track designation and priority review to facilitate expedited development and review processes with the FDA. Our investigational drug Brilacidin has been granted QIDP designation as a potential new treatment for ABSSSI.

&#160;

Fast Track Designation and Priority Review 

&#160;

Certain of our product candidates, such as Brilacidin, may qualify for Fast Track designation. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with Fast Track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product&#8217;s development. 

&#160;

Certain of our product candidates, such as Brilacidin, also may qualify for priority review. Priority review is available to a drug that treats a serious condition and that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation provides for a six-month review goal for an NDA, rather than the standard 10-month review timeframe.

&#160;

Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval, which allows the FDA to approve a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, and breakthrough therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.

&#160;

Even if a product qualifies for Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification and may rescind the designation. Moreover, none of these programs assures ultimate approval of an investigational product. FDA may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval. 

&#160;

&#160; 17 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. The drugs that we are developing will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products that are competitive with our potential products. Many of these companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, sales, distribution and technical resources and more experience in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory matters, than we do. In addition, our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any which are being developed by us or which would render our technology or potential drugs obsolete or noncompetitive. 

&#160;

With respect to Kevetrin, our lead compound for cancer, there are many drugs approved to treat various cancers and many more in the publicly disclosed development pipeline. The same is true for our other compounds in clinical trials, Prurisol and Brilacidin. There are many drugs approved to treat various forms of psoriasis and ABSSSI and many more in the publicly disclosed development pipeline. Our success depends on our ability to identify types of these respective diseases where our drugs have an advantage over existing therapies and those in the publicly disclosed development pipeline. 

&#160; EMPLOYEES
