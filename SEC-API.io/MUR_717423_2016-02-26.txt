&#160; 

Exploration and Production 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s exploration and production business explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids worldwide. The Company&#8217;s exploration and production management team directs the Company&#8217;s worldwide exploration and production activities. This business maintains upstream operating offices in other locations around the world, with the most significant of these including Houston, Texas, Calgary, Alberta and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

&#160;

During 2015, Murphy&#8217;s principal exploration and production activities were conducted in the United States by wholly owned Murphy Exploration &#38; Production Company &#8211; USA (Murphy Expro USA), in Malaysia, Australia, Brunei, Vietnam, and Namibia by wholly owned Murphy Exploration &#38; Production Company &#8211; International (Murphy Expro International) and its subsidiaries, and in Western Canada and offshore Eastern Canada by wholly-owned Murphy Oil Company Ltd. (MOCL) and its subsidiaries. Murphy&#8217;s hydrocarbon production in 2015 was in the United States, Canada and Malaysia. MOCL owns a 5% undivided interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd. in northern Alberta. In December 201 4 the Company sold 20% of its interests in Malaysia; a further sale of an additional 10% of its interest s in Malaysia was completed in January 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the Company&#8217;s oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes and proved crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are net to the Company&#8217;s working interest excluding applicable royalties. Also, unless otherwise indicated, references to oil throughout this document could include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids where applicable volumes includes a combination of these products. 

&#160; 

Murphy&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production in 2015 averaged 136, 634 barrels per day, a de c rease of 1 0% compared to 2014. As described above, the Company sold 30% of its working interest in Malaysia in late 2014 and early 2015. Production for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 increased 1 0% compared to the 2014 period as adjusted for the sale in Malaysia . The in crease in 2015 when adjusted for the sale was primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas. The Company&#8217;s worldwide sales volume of natural gas averaged 42 8 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2015, down 4 % from 2014 levels. Production for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 increased 11% compared to the 2014 period as adjusted for the Malaysia sale. The increase in natural gas sales volume in 2015 when adjusted for the sale was primarily attributable to higher gas production volumes in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and Tupper area in Western Canada . &#160; G rowth in oil and gas production volumes occurred due to further development drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper area . Total worldwide 2015 production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals one barrel of oil) was 207, 903 barrels per day, a de crease of 8 % compared to 2014 , but when adjusted for the sale in Malaysia increased 4% com pared to the 2014 . &#160; If the combined sale of 30% interest in Malaysia had occurred on January 1, 2014, total pro forma daily oil and natural gas production volumes would have been approximately 135,100 barrels and 386 MMCF, respectively, i n 2014. The 30% sale in Malaysia in late 2014 and early 2015 represented 2014 production of approximately 26,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) ; &#160; &#160; excluding these volumes, pro &#160; forma 2014 production was approximately 199,400 boepd . &#160; 

&#160; 

Total production in 2016 is currently expected to average between 1 80 ,000 and 18 5 ,000 boepd. The projected production decrease in 201 6 is primarily due to lower anticipated overall c apital spending of more than 7 0 % worldwide due to a forecast of continued low oil and gas prices during the year . 

&#160; 

United States 

In the United States, Murphy primarily has production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from fields in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Company produced 70, 675 barrels of crude oil and gas liquids per day and approximately 8 7 MMCF of natural gas per day in the U.S. in 2015. These amounts represented 52 % of the Company&#8217;s total worldwide oil and 2 0% of worldwide natural gas production volumes. The Company holds rights to approximately 157 thousand gross acres in South Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale unconventional oil and gas play. Total 2015 oil and natural gas production in the Eagle Ford area was 54,883 barrels per day and approximately 38 MMCF per day, respectively. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, Eagle Ford production accounted for 72% of total U.S. production volumes in 2015. Due to scale back of drilling and infrastructure development activities related to weak oil prices, production in the Eagle Ford Shale is forecast to decline and average approximately 4 1 ,200 barrels of oil and gas liquids per day and 30 MMCF of natural gas per day in 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s proved reserves in the Eagle Ford Shale area totaled 207.9 million barrels of crude oil, 32.1 million barrels of natural gas liquids, and 166 billion cubic feet of natural gas . 

&#160; 

During 2015, approximately 28 % of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced at fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 8 4 % of Gulf of Mexico production in 2015 was derived from four fields, including Dalmatian, Medusa, Front Runner and Thunder Hawk. The Company holds a 70% interest in Dalmatian in 

DeSoto Canyon Blocks 4 , 48 and 134 , 60% interest in Medusa in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 538/582, and 62.5% working interests in the Front Runner field in Green Canyon Blocks 338/339 and the Thunder Hawk field in Mississipp i Canyon Block 734. During 2014 , the Company acquired a 29.1% non-operated interest in the Kodiak field in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 727/771. The Kodiak field is to begin producing in the first quarter of 2016 . Total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015 was 15,7 92 barrels of oil and approximately 49 MMCF of natural gas. Production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2016 is expected to total approximately 1 4 , 0 00 barrels of oil and gas liquids per day and 2 3 MMCF of natural gas per day. At December 31, 2015, Murphy has total proved reserves 

&#160;

for Gulf of Mexico fields of 34 . 2 million barrels of oil and gas liquids and 66 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Total U.S. proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were 238 . 9 million barrels of crude oil, 35 . 4 million barrels of natural gas liquids, and 232 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

&#160; 

Canada 

In Canada, the Company holds one wholly-owned heavy oil area and one wholly-owned natural gas area in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). In addition, the Company owns interest s in three non-operated assets &#8211; the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d&#8217;Arc Basin and Syncrude Canada Ltd. in northern Alberta. Daily production in 2015 in the WCSB averaged 5 ,4 5 6 barrels of mostly heavy oil and approximately 197 MMCF of natural gas. The Company has 101 thousand net acres of Montn ey mineral rights, which includes the Tupper natural gas producing area located in northeast British Columbia . The Company has 267 thousand net acres of mineral rights in the Seal field located in the Peace River oil sands area of n orthwest Alberta. Oil and natural gas daily production for 2016 in Western Canada, excluding Syncrude, is expected to average 3,600 barrels and approximately 2 12 MMCF, respectively. The decrease in oil production in 2016 arises from well declines and selective economic related well shut-ins in the Seal area due to lower heavy oil prices . The increase in natural gas volumes in 2016 is primarily the result of new wells brought on line in the Tupper area and improved performance. Total WCSB proved liquids and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2015, excluding Syncrude, were approximately 4 . 6 million barrels and 894 billion cubic feet, respectively. 

&#160; 

Murphy has a 6.5% working interest in Hibernia, while at Terra Nova the Company&#8217;s working interest is 10.475%. Oil production in 2015 was about 4,400 barrels of oil per day at Hibernia and 3 ,000 barrels per day at Terra Nova. Hibernia production declined in 2015 due to maturity of existing wells, while Terra Nova production was slightly higher in 2015 due to higher uptime . Oil production for 2016 at Hibernia and Terra Nova is anticipated to be approximately 5,200 barrels per day and 2 , 7 00 barrels per day, respectively. Total proved oil reserves at 

December 31, 2015 at Hibernia and Terra Nova were approximately 16 . 3 million barrels and 7.4 million barrels, respectively. 

&#160; 

Murphy owns a 5% interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd., a joint venture located about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Syncrude utilizes its assets, which include three coking units, to extract bitumen from oil sand deposits and to upgrade this bitumen into a high-value synthetic crude oil . Production in 2015 was about 11,700 net barrels of synthetic crude oil per day and is expected to average about 13 , 1 00 barrels per day in 2016. Total proved synthetic oil reserves for Syncrude at year-end 2015 were 114 . 8 million barrels. 

&#160; 

Malaysia 

In Malaysia, the Company has majority interests in eight separate production sharing contracts (PSCs). The Company serves as the operator of all these areas other than the unitized Kakap-Gumusut field. The production sharing co ntracts cover approximately 3.68 million gross acres. In December 2014 and January 2015, the Company sold 30% of its interest in most Malaysian oil and gas assets. 

&#160; 

Murphy has a 59.5% interest in oil and natural gas discoveries in two shallow-water blocks, SK 309 and SK 311, offshore Sarawak. Approximately 15,900 barrels of oil and gas liquids per day were produced in 2015 at Blocks SK 309/311. Oil and gas liquids production in 2016 at fields in Blocks SK 309/311 is anticipated to total about 1 3 , 5 00 barrels of oil per day, with the reduction from 2015 primarily related to natural field decline . The Company has a gas sales contract for the Sarawak area with PETRONAS, the Malaysian state-owned oil company, and has an ongoing multi-phase development plan for several natural gas discoveries on these blocks. The gas sales contract allows for gross sales volumes of 250 MMCF per day through September 2021 , but allows the Company to deliver higher sales volumes as requested. Total net natural gas sales volume offshore Sarawak was about 12 2 MMCF per day during 2015 (gross 272 MMCF per day). Sarawak net natural gas sales volumes are anticipated to be approximately 11 4 MMCF per day in 2016 . Total proved reserves of liquids and natural gas at December 31, 2015 for Blocks SK 309/311 were 13 . 3 million barrels and approximately 20 3 billion cubic feet, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Company made a major discovery at the Kikeh field in deepwater Block K, offshore Sabah, Malaysia, in 2002 and added another discovery at Kakap in 2004. An additional discovery was made in Block K at Siakap North in 2009. The Company has interest s in three Block K discovered fields, which include Kikeh &#160; (56%) K akap &#160; (8.6%) and Sia kap North &#160; (22.4%) &#160; (hereafter &#8220;Siakap&#8221;). Total gross acreage held by the Company in Block K as of Decemb er 31, 2015 was approximately 82 ,000 acres. Production volumes at Kikeh averaged approximately 14,700 barrels of oil per day during 2015. Oil production at Kikeh is anticipated to average approximately 10, 5 00 barrels per day in 2016. The reduction in Kikeh oil production in 2016 is primarily attributable to overall field decline. The Kakap field in Block K is operated by another company and was jointly developed with the Gumusut field owned by others . Early production began in late 2012 at Kakap via a temporary tie-back to the Kikeh production facility. The primary Kakap main field production facility was completed and full-field production started up in October 2014. 

&#160;

Kakap oil production in 2015 totaled about 7 ,000 net barrels of oil per day. In 2016, Kakap production is expected to average near 9,1 00 barrels of oil per day. The Siakap oil discovery was developed as a unitized area with the Petai field owned by others, and the combined development is operated by Murphy, with a tie-back to the Kikeh field. Production began in 2014 at Siakap, and daily production averaged near 4 ,000 barrels of oil for 2015 at this field. In 2016, Siakap field production is expected to average 2 , 6 00 barrels of oil per day. The Company has a Block K natural gas sales contract with PETRONAS that calls for gross sales volumes of up to 120 MMCF per day. Gas production in Block K will continue until the earlier of lack of available commercial quantities of associated gas reserves or expiry of the Block K production sharing contract. Natural gas production in Block K in 2015 totaled approximately 22 MMCF per day. Daily gas production in 2016 in Block K is expected to average about 1 2 MMCF per day. Total proved reserves booked in Block K as of year-end 2015 were 6 1 .8 million barrels of crude oil and about 3 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

&#160; 

The Company also has an interest in deepwater Block H offshore Sabah. In early 2007, the Company announced a significant natural gas discovery at the Rotan well in Block H. The Company followed up Rotan with several other nearby discoveries. Following the partial sell down, Murphy&#8217;s interests in Block H range between 42% and 56%. Total gross acreage held by the Company at year-end 2015 in Block H was 15.99 million acres. In early 2014, PETRONAS and the Company sanctioned a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) project for Block H, and agreed terms for sales of natural gas to be produced with prices tied to an oil index. First production is currently expected at Block H in 2018. At December 31, 2015, total natural gas prov ed reserves for Block H were approximately 311 billion cubic feet. 

&#160; 

The Company has a 42% interest in a gas holding area covering approximately 2,000 gross acres in Block P. This interest can be retained until January 2018. &#160; 

&#160; 

In May 2013, the Company acquired an interest in shallow-water Malaysia Block SK 314A. The PSC covers a 

three year exploration period. The Company&#8217;s working interest in Block SK 314A is 59.5%. This block includes 1.12 million gross acres. The Company has a 70% carry of a 15% partner in this concession through the minimum work program. The first exploration wells were drilled in 2015 for this block. 

&#160; 

In February 2015, the Company acquired a 50% interest in offshore Block SK 2C. The Company operates the block, which includes 1.08 million gross acres. The concession carries one well commitment during the one-year exploration period. The first exploration period has been extended for six months. At the expiration of the first exploration period, the Company can opt to extend for two additional years by agreeing to drill another well. 

&#160; 

Murphy has a 75% interest in gas holding agreements for Kenarong and Pertang discoveries made in Block PM 311 located offshore peninsular Malaysia. An application for an extension of a gas holding agreement was presented to PETRONAS in 2014, but the application was rejected. Due to the uncertainty of the future production of the gas discovered in Block PM 311, in 2014 the Company wrote off the prior-year well costs of $47.4 million related to Kenarong and Pertang . The Company never included natural gas for Block PM 311 in its proved gas reserves. 

&#160; 

Australia 

In Australia, the Company holds eight offshore exploration permits and serves as operator of six of them. 

&#160; 

The first permit was acquired in 2007 with a 40% interest in Block AC/P36 in the Browse Basin. Murphy renewed the exploration permit for an additional five years and in that process relinquished 50% of the gross acreage; the license now covers 482 thousand gross acres and expires in 2019 . In 2012, Murphy increased its working interest in the remaining acreage to 100% and subsequently farmed out a 50% working interest and operatorship. The existing work commitment for this license includes further geophysical work. 

&#160; 

In May 2012, Murphy was awarded permit WA-476-P in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia. The Company holds 100% working interest in the permit which covers 177 thousand gross acres.

This permit expires in 2018. 

&#160; 

The Company also acquired permit WA-481-P in the Perth Basin, offshore Western Australia, in August 2012. Murphy holds a 40% working interest and operatorship of the permit, which covers approximately 4.30 million gross acres. The work commitment calls for 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and processing, geophysical work and three exploration we lls. Three wells were drilled on the license in 2015. All three wells were unsuccessful and costs were expensed. This permit expires in 2018. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In November 2012, Murphy acquired a 20% non-operated working interest in permit WA-408-P in the Browse Basin. The permit comprises approximately 417 thousand gross acres and expires in 2016 . Two wells were drilled on the license in 2013. The first well found hydrocarbon but was deemed commercially unsuccessful and was written off to expense. The second well was also unsuccessful and costs were expensed in 201 3 . 

&#160; 

The Company was awarded permit EPP43 in the Ceduna Basin, offshore South Australia, in October 2013. The Company operates the concession and holds a 50% working interest in the permit covering approximately 4.08 million gross acres.

In December 2011, Murphy signed a PSC with Suriname&#8217;s state oil company, Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (Staatsolie), whereby it acquired a 100% working interest and operatorship of Block 48 offshore Suriname. The block encompasses 794 thousand gross acres with water depths ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. In early 2014, Murphy farmed out a portion of its working interest in Block 48, thereby reducing its interest from 100% to 50% and in early 2015 Murphy relinquished its license in this block. 

&#160; 

Republic of the Congo 

The Company formerly had interests in Prod uction Sharing Agreements covering two offshore blocks in Republic of the Congo &#8211; Mer Profonde Sud (MPS) and Mer Profonde Nord (MPN). In 2005, Murphy made an oil discovery at Azurite Marine #1 in the southern block, MPS. Total oil production in 2013 averaged 1,000 barrels per day at Azurite for the Company&#8217;s 50% interest. The field was shut down and ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and abandonment operations were completed in 2014. Abandonment and other exit charges of $82.5 million were recorded in 2013 associated with the earlier than anticipated shutdown of the Azurite field. The MPN block exploration license expired on December 30, 2012 and MPS block exploration license expired in March 2013. Murphy decommissioned the Azurite field upon completion of abandonment in 2014 and has exited the country. 

&#160; 

United Kingdom &#8211; Discontinued Operations 

Murphy produced oil and natural gas in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea for many years. In 2013, Murphy sold all of its oil and gas properties in the U.K. with an after-tax gain of $216.1 million on the sale. Total 2013 production in the U.K. on a full-year basis amounted to about 600 barrels of oil per day and 1 MMCF of natural gas per day. The Company has accounted for U.K. oil and gas activities as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

&#160; 

Ecuador &#8211; Discontinued Operations 

Murphy sold its 20% working interest in Block 16, Ecuador in March 2009. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador passed a law that increased its share of revenue for sales prices that exceed a base price (about $23.36 per barrel at December 31, 2008) from 50% to 99%. The government had previously enacted a 50% revenue sharing 

&#160;

rate in April 2006. The Company initiated arbitration proceedings against the government in one arbitral body claiming that the government did not have the right under the contract to enact the revenue sharing provision. In 2010, the arbitration panel determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim due to technicalities. The arbitration was refiled in 2011 before a different arbitral body. The arbitration proceeding was held in late 2014 and the Company continues to await a decision by the tribunal . The Company&#8217;s total claim in the arbi tration process is in excess of $118 million.

During 2015, Murphy added proved reserves of 17 . 5 million barrels of oil equivalent ( mmboe ). The most significant adds to total proved reserves related to drilling and well performance in the Montney gas area of Western Canada that added 2 0.0 mmboe, and drilling and well performance in the Eagle Ford Shale that added 7 8 .0 mmboe. The Company sold an additional 10% of its oil and gas assets in Malaysia during the year which reduced its proved reserves by 24 . 1 &#160; mmboe . Murphy&#8217;s total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 increased 15 . 8 MMBOE from a year earlier. The conversion of non-proved reserves to newly reported proved undeveloped reserves reported in the table as extensions and discoveries during 2015 was predominantly attributable to two areas &#8211; drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and the Montney area in Western Canada as these areas had active development work ongoing during the year. The majority of proved undeveloped reserves reductions associated with revisions of previous estimates were the result of lower oil and gas prices causing these volumes to either become uneconomical or expire due to reallocated capital. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves migration to the proved developed category occurred in the Eagle Ford Shale , Gulf of Mexico 

&#160;

and Montney, &#160; attributed to drilling . T he Company sold an additional 10% interest in its Malaysian oil and gas properties in early 2015 which led to a reduction of proved undeveloped reserves of 10.3 MMBOE during the year. Th e Company spent approximately $800 .0 m illion in 2015 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to prove developed reserves. The Company expects to spend about $ 4 0 0 m illion in 2016, $ 40 0 m illion in 2017 and $ 50 0 m illion in 2018 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The anticipated level of spend in 2016 primarily includes drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper gas area s . In computing MMBOE, natural gas is converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six thousand cubic feet (MCF) to one barrel of oil. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, proved reserves are included for several development projects, including oil developments at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Kakap, Kikeh and Siakap fields, offshore Sabah, Malaysia, as well as natural gas developments offshore Sarawak and offshore Block H, Malaysia. Total proved undeveloped reserves associated with various development projects at December 31, 2015 were approximately 295 MMBOE, which is 38 % of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves. Certain development projects have proved undeveloped reserves that will take more than five years to bring to production. The Company operates deepwater field s in the Gulf of Mexico that ha ve t hree undeveloped locations that exceed this five-year window. Total reserves associated with the three locations amount to less than 1% of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves at year-end 2015. The development of certain of these reserves stretches beyond five years due to limited well slots available, thus making it necessary to wait for depletion of other wells prior to initiating further development of these locations. The second project that will take more than five years to develop is offshore Malaysia and makes up approximately 1 % of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves at year-end 2015. This project is an extension of the Sarawak natural gas project and is expected to be on production in 201 8 once current projec t production volumes decline. Additionally, t he Block H development project has undeveloped proved reserves that make up 7% of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves at year-end 2015. This operated project will take longer than five years from discovery to completely develop due to construction of floating LNG facilities and the remote location offshore deep waters in Sabah Malaysia. Field start up is expected to occur in 2018, which is less than five years beyond the period that proved undeveloped reserves were first recorded. 

&#160; 

Murphy Oil&#8217;s Reserves Processes and Policies 

&#160; 

The Company employs a Manager of Corporate Reserves (Manager) who is independent of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas management. The Manager reports to the Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning &#38; Services, of Murphy Oil Corporation, who in turn reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Murphy Oil. The Manager makes presentations to the Board of Directors periodically about the Company&#8217;s reserves. The Manager reviews and discusses reserves estimates directly with the Company&#8217;s reservoir engineering staff in order to make every effort to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and industry. The Manager coordinates and oversees reserves audits. These audits are performed annually and target coverage of approximately one-third of Company reserves each year. The audits are performed by the Manager and qualified engineering staff from areas of the Company other than the area being audited. The Manager may also utilize qualified independent reserves consultants to assist with the internal audits or to perform separate audits as considered appropriate. 

&#160; 

Each significant exploration and production office maintains one or more Qualified Reserve Estimators (QRE) on staff. The QRE is responsible for estimating and evaluating reserves and other reserves information for his or her assigned area. The QRE may personally make the estimates and evaluations of reserves or may supervise and approve the estimation and evaluation thereof by others. A QRE is professionally qualified to perform these reserves estimates due to having sufficient educational background, professional training and professional experience to enable him or her to exercise prudent professional judgment . 

&#160;

Normally, this requires a minimum of three years practical experience in petroleum engineering or petroleum production geology, with at least one year of such experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, and either a bachelors or advanced degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other discipline of engineering or physical science from a college or university of recognized stature, or the equivalent thereof from an appropriate government authority or professional organization. 

&#160; 

Larger offices of the Company also employ a Regional Reserves Coordinator (RRC) who supervises the local QREs. The RRC is usually a senior QRE that has the primary responsibility for coordinating and submitting reserves information to senior management. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s QREs maintain files containing pertinent data regarding each significant reservoir. Each file includes sufficient data to support the calculations or analogies used to develop the values. Examples of data included in the file, as appropriate, include: &#160; production histories; pertinent drilling and workover histories; bottom hole pressure data; volumetric, material balance, analogy or other pertinent reserve estimation data; production performance curves; narrative descriptions of the methods and logic used to determine reserves values; maps and logs; and a signed copy of the conclusion of the QRE stating, that in their opinion, the reserves have been calculated, reviewed, documented and reported in compliance with the regulations and guidelines contained in the reserves training manual. The Company&#8217;s reserves are maintained in an industry recognized reservoir engineering software system, which has adequate access controls to avoid the possibility of improper manipulation of data. When reserves calculations are completed by QREs and appropriately reviewed by RRCs and the Manager, the conclusions are reviewed and discussed with the head of the Company&#8217;s exploration and production business and other senior management as appropriate. The Company&#8217;s Controller&#8217;s department is responsible for preparing and filing reserves schedules within the Form 10-K report. 

&#160; 

Murphy provides annual training to all company reserves estimators to ensure SEC requirements associated with reserves estimation and Form 10-K reporting are fulfilled. The training includes materials provided to each participant that outlines the latest guidance from the SEC as well as best practices for many engineering and geologic matters related to reserves estimation. 

&#160; 

Qualifications of Manager of Corporate Reserves 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it has qualified employees preparing oil and gas reserves estimates. Mr. F. Michael Lasswell serves as Corporate Reserves Manager after joining the Company in 2012. Prior to joining Murphy, Mr. Lasswell was employed as a Regional Coordinator of reserves at a major integrated oil company. He worked in several capacities in the reservoir engineering department with the oil company from 2002 to 2012. Mr. Lasswell earned a Bachelor&#8217;s of Science degree in Civil Engineering and a Masters of Science degree in Geotechnical Engineering from Brigham Young University. Mr. Lasswell has experience working in the reservoir engineering field in numerous areas of the world, including the North Sea, the U.S. Arctic, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. He serves on the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Oil and Gas Reserves Committee (OGRC) and is also co-author of a paper on the Recognition of Reserves which was published by the SPE. Mr. Lasswell has also attended numerous industry training courses. 

&#160; 

More information regarding Murphy&#8217;s estimated quantities of proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for the last three years are presented by geographic area on pages F-5 1 through F-57 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy has not filed and is not required to file any estimates of its total proved oil or gas reserves on a recurring basis with any federal or foreign governmental regulatory authority or agency other than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Annually, Murphy reports gross reserves of properties operated in the United States to the U.S. Department of Energy; such reserves are derived from the same data from which estimated proved reserves of such properties are determined. 

&#160; 

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production and sales, and natural gas sales by geographic area with weighted average sa les prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 201 5 are shown on pages 31 and 33 of this &#160; Form 10-K R eport . In 201 5 , the Company&#8217;s production of oil and natural gas represented approximately 0.1% of worldwide totals. 

&#160; 

Production expenses for the last three years in U.S. dollars per equivalent barrel are discussed beginning on page 3 5 of this Form 10-K report. For purposes of these computations, natural gas sales volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six MCF of natural gas to one barrel of oil. 

&#160; 

Supplemental disclosures relating to oil and gas producing activities are reported o n pages F-49 through F-6 2 of this Form 10-K report.

&#160; 

As used in the three tables that follow, &#8220;gross&#8221; wells are the total wells in which all or part of the working interest is owned by Murphy, and &#8220;net&#8221; wells are the total of the Company&#8217;s fractional working interests in gross wells expressed as the equivalent number of wholly owned wells. An &#8220;exploratory&#8221; well is drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area and includes delineation wells which target a new reservoir in a field known to be productive or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. A &#8220;development&#8221; well is drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir that is known to be productive.
