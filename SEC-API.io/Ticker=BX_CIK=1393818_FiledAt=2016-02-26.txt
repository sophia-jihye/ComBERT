 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

Blackstone is a leading global alternative asset manager, with Total Assets Under Management of $336.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. As stewards of public funds, we look to drive outstanding results for our investors and clients by deploying capital and ideas to help businesses succeed and grow. Our alternative asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions, non-investment grade credit, secondary funds and other multi-asset class strategies. We historically also provided a wide range of financial advisory services, including financial and strategic advisory, restructuring and reorganization advisory, capital markets and fund placement services. In October 2015, however, we completed the previously-announced spin-off of these businesses, other than our capital markets services business, which was retained. 

All of Blackstone&#146;s businesses use a solutions oriented approach to drive better performance. We believe our scaled, diversified businesses, coupled with our long track record of investment performance, proven investment approach and strong client relationships, position us to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions, expand our assets under management and add complementary businesses. 

Two of our primary limited partner constituencies are public pension and corporate funds. As a result, to the extent our funds perform well, it supports a better retirement for millions of pensioners. 

In addition, because we are a global firm with a footprint on nearly every continent, our investments can make a difference around the world. We are committed to making our family of companies stronger in ways that can have transformative impacts on local economies. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 104 senior managing directors and employed approximately 790 other investment professionals at our headquarters in New York and in 20 other cities around the world. We believe hiring, training and retaining talented individuals coupled with our rigorous investment process has supported our excellent investment record over many years. This record in turn has allowed us to successfully and repeatedly raise additional assets from an increasingly wide variety of sophisticated investors. 

2015 Highlights 

Strong Realization Activity 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sustained strong exit activity despite a volatile market backdrop and slowing public sales, with total realizations of $43 billion, down slightly from a firm record of $45 billion in 2014. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Active participation in equity and debt capital markets, including over 30 public equity transactions raising an aggregate of over $15 billion in proceeds, and a number of portfolio company refinancings. Equity capital markets activity included the successful initial public offerings of Summit Materials, Scout24, Performance Food Group, Intertrust and SH Kelkar. 

Record Global Investment Pace 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our funds, including co-investments, invested a record $32 billion of capital. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Global scale and size allow Blackstone to identify relative value and deploy capital in the most attractive opportunities. Our real estate business leveraged its singular platform to consummate hallmark deals in 2015, including the acquisition of the majority of GE Capital&#146;s real estate business, the acquisition of Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan&#146;s largest apartment complex, and four take-privates of public real estate companies. 

&#160; 

Strong Growth in Assets Under Management Despite Record Realization Pace 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Each of our investing businesses saw positive growth in Assets Under Management in 2015, despite significant levels of realizations, primarily due to continued strong inflows through product and channel diversification. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Gross organic capital inflows across our businesses reached $94 billion for 2015, of which $13 billion was through the retail channel (which includes funds raised through intermediary firms that focus their offerings primarily on private clients and flows into products whose target audience is private clients, such as mutual funds, separately managed accounts and business development companies). We believe $94 billion of gross organic capital inflows is a record fiscal year for any alternative asset management firm. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our seventh flagship private equity fund closed with third party commitments of $17.5 billion. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our eighth global real estate fund closed with third party commitments of $16 billion. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our new core+ real estate platform raised nearly $7 billion in its second year to reach $11 billion in Assets Under Management. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hedge Fund Solutions had external gross inflows of $11 billion, including additional inflows into Blackstone Alternative Asset Management&#146;s (&#147;BAAM&#148;) registered product platform, which is now $7 billion in size. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Senfina, BAAM&#146;s multi-strategy trading platform, grew rapidly to $2 billion in Assets Under Management across eight portfolio managers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strategic Partners began raising its latest secondary fund of funds. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tactical Opportunities continued fundraising for its platform of separately managed accounts, raising over $7 billion in 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Credit continued to diversify the platform and launch new products, driving $23 billion in gross inflows during 2015. 

Completion of the Spin-Off of Our Advisory Business 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In October, we completed the previously-announced spin-off of the operations that have historically constituted our Financial Advisory segment, other than our capital markets services business, a transaction that creates new growth opportunities for our investing business. The financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services and Park Hill Group businesses were spun-off from Blackstone and combined with PJT Capital LP, an independent financial advisory firm founded by Paul J. Taubman, to form an independent, publicly traded company called PJT Partners Inc. 

Industry-Leading Credit Rating and Strong Balance Sheet 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong balance sheet with no net debt, $4.2 billion in total cash, corporate treasury and liquid investments, and a $1.1 billion undrawn revolver. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; S&#38;P and Fitch have both affirmed Blackstone&#146;s A+ / A+ credit ratings, making Blackstone the highest rated alternative asset manager and one of the highest rated global financial services firms. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Raised $678 million of debt capital in 2015, including the successful execution of our first euro bond sale in a highly oversubscribed offering of &#128;300 million of 2.0% notes due 2025 and of an offering of $350 million of 4.45% notes due 2045. 

Positively Impacting Communities 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Blackstone Charitable Foundation believes that entrepreneurship plays a crucial role in economic growth. The Foundation works with local partners in targeted regions worldwide to create or grow 

&#160; 

&#160; non-profit programs that support the networks and resources that entrepreneurs need to succeed. The Foundation has committed $40 million to this &#147;Entrepreneurship Initiative&#148; since the program&#146;s inception in 2010. In 2015, the Foundation expanded one of its signature programs &#147;Blackstone LaunchPad,&#148; to three universities in Ireland and five universities in New York state. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In support of The White House&#146;s &#147;Joining Forces&#148; initiative, Blackstone launched its Veterans Hiring Initiative, committing to hire 50,000 veterans across our portfolio of companies over a five-year period. More than 33,000 veterans have been hired since the Veterans Hiring Initiative was announced in April 2013. In 2015, we partnered with KKR, Carlyle and TPG to expand our annual summit to include representatives from across the industry, with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama delivering keynote remarks and 150 hiring executives from the firms&#146; collective portfolio in attendance. 

Business Segments 

Our four business segments are: (a) Private Equity, (b) Real Estate, (c) Hedge Fund Solutions and (d) Credit. 

Information about our business segments should be read together with &#147;Part II. Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As a result of the spin-off of our Financial Advisory business in October 2015, which did not include our capital markets services business, the results of our capital markets services business were reclassified from our prior Financial Advisory segment to the Private Equity segment. All prior periods in this report have been recast to reflect this reclassification. 

Private Equity 

Our Private Equity segment, established in 1987, is a global business with approximately 230 investment professionals managing $94.3 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2015. We are focused on identifying, managing and creating lasting value for our investors. Our Private Equity segment includes our (a) corporate private equity funds, (b) Tactical Opportunities, our opportunistic investment platform that invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, (c) Strategic Partners, our secondary private fund of funds business, (d) Blackstone Total Alternatives Solution (&#147;BTAS&#148;), a new multi-asset investment program for eligible high net worth investors offering exposure to certain of Blackstone&#146;s key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment and (e) our capital markets services business. We have raised seven general private equity funds as well as three specialized corporate private equity funds focusing on energy and communications-related investments. We are currently investing from our sixth general private equity fund, Blackstone Capital Partners VI (&#147;BCP VI&#148;) and our second energy fund, Blackstone Energy Partners II (&#147;BEP II&#148;). 

Our corporate private equity business pursues transactions throughout the world across a variety of transaction types, including large buyouts, mid-cap buyouts, buy and build platforms (which involve multiple acquisitions behind a single management team and platform) and growth equity/development projects (which involve significant minority investments in mature companies and greenfield development projects in energy and power). Our private equity business&#146;s investment strategies and core themes continually evolve, in anticipation of, or in response to changes in the global economy, local markets, regulation, capital flows and geopolitical trends. We seek to construct a differentiated portfolio of investments with a well-defined, interventionist, post-acquisition value creation strategy. Similarly, we seek investments that can generate strong unlevered returns regardless of entry or exit cycle timing. Finally, when we can identify sectors or geographies in which the demand for capital greatly exceeds the readily available supply, our private equity business seeks to make investments at or near book value where it can create goodwill or franchise value through post-acquisition actions. 

Tactical Opportunities, our opportunistic investment platform, invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies. Tactical Opportunities&#146; mandate allows for flexible investing where it seeks to capitalize on 

&#160; 

time-sensitive, complex or dislocated market situations in areas where it sees mispriced risks. The Tactical Opportunities team leverages intellectual capital from across all of our businesses to inform our investment diligence and execution. A flexible investment mandate allows Tactical Opportunities to structure a broad range of investments, including private and public securities and instruments, where the underlying exposure may be to equity, debt and/or real assets, and to construct a diversified portfolio of investments that provides differentiated exposures relative to traditional alternative asset managers. 

Strategic Partners, our secondary private fund of funds business was established in 2000. Strategic Partners is focused on delivering access to a range of opportunities, leveraging its proprietary database to acquire single fund interests or complex portfolios in an efficient and timely manner. 

For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Private Equity segment, see &#147;&#151; Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure&#148; in this Item 1. 

Real Estate 

Since our start in 1991, we have become a world leader in real estate investing with approximately 265 investment professionals and $93.9 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2015. We have managed or continue to manage a number of global, European and Asian focused opportunistic real estate funds, several real estate debt investment vehicles, a NYSE publicly traded real estate investment trust (&#147;BXMT&#148;) and several core+ real estate funds. We refer to our opportunistic real estate funds as our Blackstone Real Estate Partners (&#147;BREP&#148;) funds, our real estate debt investment vehicles as our Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies (&#147;BREDS&#148;) funds and our core+ real estate funds as our Blackstone Property Partners (&#147;BPP&#148;) funds. 

Our BREP funds are geographically diversified and target a broad range of &#147;opportunistic&#148; real estate and real estate related investments that are generally undermanaged assets with higher potential for equity appreciation. BREP has made significant investments in lodging, office buildings, shopping centers, residential and a variety of real estate operating companies. 

Our BREDS&#146; vehicles target real estate debt related investment opportunities in the public and private markets, primarily in the United States and Europe. 

Our BPP funds are geographically diversified and target substantially stabilized assets generating relatively stable cash flow with a focus on office, multifamily, industrial and retail assets in gateway markets. 

Our Real Estate segment&#146;s investing approach is guided by several core investment principles, including global scope, a significant number of exclusive opportunities, financing expertise, operations oversight and a strong focus on value creation. For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Real Estate segment, see &#147;&#151; Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure&#148; in this Item 1. 

Hedge Fund Solutions 

Our Hedge Fund Solutions group is comprised primarily of Blackstone Alternative Asset Management (&#147;BAAM&#148;). BAAM is the world&#146;s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds, managing a broad range of commingled and customized hedge fund of fund solutions since its inception in 1990. The Hedge Fund Solution segment also includes investment platforms that seed new hedge fund talent, purchase ownership interests in more established hedge funds, invest in special situation opportunities, create alternative solutions in regulated structures and trade long and short public equities. Working with our clients over the past 26 years, our Hedge Fund Solutions group has developed into a leading manager of institutional hedge fund of funds with approximately 165 investment professionals managing $69.1 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2015. Hedge Fund Solutions&#146; overall investment philosophy is to protect and grow investors&#146; assets through both commingled and 

&#160; 

custom-tailored investment strategies designed to deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns and mitigate risk. Diversification, risk management, due diligence and a focus on downside protection are key tenets of our approach. For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Hedge Fund Solutions segment, see &#147;&#151; Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure&#148; in this Item 1. 

Credit 

Our credit business, consisting principally of GSO Capital Partners LP (&#147;GSO&#148;), with $79.1 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 160 investment professionals, is a leading participant in the leveraged finance markets. The funds we manage or sub-advise include senior credit-focused funds, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and general credit-focused funds concentrated in the leveraged finance marketplace. GSO also manages separately managed accounts and registered investment companies including business development companies. These vehicles have investment portfolios consisting of loans and securities spread across the capital structure, including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. GSO may utilize leverage in connection with certain of the investments made by the credit-focused funds, separately managed accounts or registered investment companies. GSO manages 51 separate CLOs as of December 31, 2015, focused primarily on senior secured debt issued by a diverse universe of non-investment grade companies. 

Financial and Other Information by Segment 

Financial and other information by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is set forth in Note 21. &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; in the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in &#147;Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; of this filing. 

P&#225;tria Investments 

On October 1, 2010, we purchased a 40% equity interest in P&#225;tria Investments Limited and P&#225;tria Investimentos Ltda. (collectively, &#147;P&#225;tria&#148;). P&#225;tria is a leading Brazilian alternative asset manager that was founded in 1988. As of December 31, 2015, P&#225;tria&#146;s alternative asset management businesses managed $8.6 billion in assets and include the management of private equity funds ($3.9 billion), real estate funds ($1.1 billion), infrastructure funds ($3.3 billion) and new initiatives ($310 million). P&#225;tria has approximately 230 employees and is led by a group of three managing partners. Our investment in P&#225;tria is a minority, non-controlling investment, which we record using the equity method of accounting. We have representatives on P&#225;tria&#146;s board of directors in proportion to our ownership, but we do not control the day-to-day management of the firm or the investment decisions of their funds, all of which continues to reside with the local Brazilian partners. 

Investment Process and Risk Management 

We maintain a rigorous investment process across all of our funds, accounts and other investment vehicles. Each fund, account or other vehicle has investment policies and procedures that generally contain requirements and limitations for investments, such as limitations relating to the amount that will be invested in any one investment and the types of industries or geographic regions in which the fund, account or other vehicle will invest, as well as limitations required by law. In addition, the chief investment officers of our businesses play a central role in the evaluation of investment opportunities, including by serving as members of their respective investment committees. 

Our business&#146; investment committees review and evaluate investment opportunities in a framework that includes a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the key risks of each investment. For example, considerations that the investment committees of our private equity funds take into account when evaluating an investment include the quality of a business in which the fund proposes to invest and the quality of the management team of such business, expected levered and unlevered returns of the investment in a variety of investment scenarios, the ability of the company in which the investment is made to service debt in a range of economic and interest rate 

&#160; 

environments, environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues and macroeconomic trends in the relevant geographic region. In addition, considerations that the investment committees of our real estate funds take into account when evaluating an investment include current and anticipated market fundamentals (including, for example, supply and demand fundamentals) and macroeconomic trends in the relevant geographic region, the quality of the asset in which the fund proposes to invest, the appropriateness of existing or planned leverage levels of the business or asset and our ability to successfully implement operational plans and improvements and exit the investment at an expected rate of return. 

Private Equity Funds 

Our Private Equity investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, diligencing, negotiating, executing, managing and exiting investments, as well as pursuing operational improvements and value creation. After an initial selection, evaluation and diligence process, the relevant team of investment professionals (i.e., the deal team) submits a proposed transaction for review by the review committee of our private equity funds. Review committee meetings are led by an executive committee of several senior managing directors of our Private Equity segment. Following assimilation of the review committee&#146;s input and its decision to proceed with a proposed transaction, the proposed investment is vetted by the investment committee. The investment committee of our private equity funds is composed of Stephen A. Schwarzman, Hamilton E. James and selected senior managing directors of our Private Equity segment as appropriate based on the location and sector of the proposed transaction. The investment committee is responsible for approving all investment decisions made on behalf of our private equity funds. Both the review committee and the investment committee processes involve a consensus approach to decision making among committee members. 

Our Tactical Opportunities business has a substantially similar process to the Private Equity process described above, with the exception of the composition of the review and investment committees. The Tactical Opportunities review committee is comprised of the senior managing directors and managing directors of the Tactical Opportunities business and a senior managing director of our Private Equity business, and the investment committee is comprised of Mr. Schwarzman, Mr. James, the business heads of Blackstone&#146;s Private Equity, Real Estate and Credit businesses, and certain other senior managing directors. 

The investment professionals of our private equity funds are responsible for monitoring an investment once it is made and for making recommendations with respect to exiting an investment. In addition to members of a deal team and our portfolio operations group, which is responsible for monitoring and assisting in enhancing portfolio companies&#146; operations and value, all professionals in the Private Equity segment meet several times each year to review the performance of the funds&#146; portfolio companies. 

Our Strategic Partners secondary private equity investment professionals seek capital appreciation through the purchase of secondary interests in mature, high-quality private equity funds from investors seeking liquidity. After rigorous, highly analytical investment and operational due diligence, the Strategic Partners&#146; investment professionals will present a proposed transaction to the group&#146;s Investment Committee. The Strategic Partners Investment Committee is made up of senior members of the Strategic Partners team, including all of the group&#146;s Senior Managing Directors. The Investment Committee meets on an ad hoc basis as needed to review transactions. After reviewing the investment team&#146;s Investment Committee Memorandum and discussing the contemplated transaction with the deal team, the Investment Committee decides whether to approve or deny the investment. The investment professionals on the Strategic Partners team are responsible for monitoring each investment once it is made. In addition to members of the investment team, and given the large number of underlying investments, the Strategic Partners Finance team will also track investment valuations pursuant to the group&#146;s valuation policies and procedures. 

Real Estate Funds 

Our Real Estate investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, diligencing, negotiating, executing, managing, monitoring and exiting investments, as well as pursuing operational 

&#160; 

improvements and value creation. Our real estate operation has an investment committee similar to that described under &#147;&#151; Private Equity Funds.&#148; After an initial selection, evaluation and diligence process, the relevant team of investment professionals (i.e., the deal team) will present a proposed transaction at a weekly meeting of the investment committee. The real estate investment committee, which includes Mr. Schwarzman, Mr. James and the senior managing directors in the Real Estate segment, scrutinizes potential transactions, provides guidance and instructions at the appropriate stage of each transaction and approves the making and disposition of each BREP and BPP fund investment. The committee also approves significant illiquid investments by the BREDS funds. Additionally, BXMT has an investment risk management committee comprised solely of independent directors, which is responsible for approving certain significant BXMT investments. In addition to members of a deal team and our asset management group responsible for monitoring and assisting in enhancing portfolio companies&#146; operations and value, senior professionals in the Real Estate segment meet several times each year to review the performance of the funds&#146; portfolio companies and other investments. 

Hedge Fund Solutions 

Before deciding to invest in a new hedge fund or with a new hedge fund manager, our Hedge Fund Solutions team conducts extensive due diligence, including an on-site &#147;front office&#148; review of the fund&#146;s/manager&#146;s performance, investment terms, investment strategy and investment personnel, a &#147;back office&#148; review of the fund&#146;s/manager&#146;s operations, processes, risk management and internal controls, industry reference checks and a legal review of the investment structures and legal documents. Once initial due diligence procedures are completed and the investment and other professionals are satisfied with the results of the review, the team will present the potential investment to the relevant Hedge Fund Solutions Investment Committee. The Investment Committees are comprised of relevant senior managing directors and senior investment personnel. The Hedge Fund Solutions&#146; Executive Committee reviews and approves all investment allocations where there is limited capacity or there are other unusual circumstances for compliance with the relevant allocation procedures. Existing investments are reviewed and monitored on a regular and continuous basis, and J. Tomilson Hill, CEO of Hedge Fund Solutions and Vice Chairman of Blackstone, and other senior members of our Hedge Fund Solutions team, generally meet bi-weekly with Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. James for a high-level review of the group&#146;s business and affairs. 

Credit 

Each of our credit-focused funds has an investment committee similar to that described under &#147;&#151; Private Equity Funds.&#148; The investment committees for the credit-focused funds, which typically include Bennett J. Goodman and J. Albert Smith III and senior members of the respective investment teams associated with each credit-focused fund, review potential transactions, provide input regarding the scope of due diligence and approve recommended investments and dispositions. These investment committees have delegated certain abilities to approve investments and dispositions to credit committees within each operation which consist of the senior members of the respective investment teams associated with each fund. In addition, senior members of GSO, including Mr. Goodman and Mr. Smith III, meet regularly with Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. James to discuss investment and risk management activities and market conditions. 

The investment decisions for the customized credit long-only clients and other clients whose portfolios are actively traded are made by separate investment committees, each of which is composed of certain of the group&#146;s respective senior managing directors, managing directors and other investment professionals. With limited exceptions where the portfolio managers wish to capitalize on time sensitive market opportunities, the investment committee approves all assets that are held by the applicable client. The investment team is staffed by professionals within research, portfolio management, trading and capital formation to ensure active management of the portfolios. Investment decisions (including the approval of the asset for the initial purchase) follow a consensus-based approach. Industry-focused research analysts provide the committee with a formal and comprehensive review of any new investment recommendation, while our portfolio managers and trading professionals provide opinions on other technical aspects of the recommendation as well as the risks associated with the overall portfolio composition. 

&#160; 

Investments are subject to predetermined periodic reviews to assess their continued fit within the funds. Our research team monitors the operating performance of the underlying issuers, while portfolio managers, in concert with our traders, focus on optimizing asset composition to maximize value for our investors. 

Structure and Operation of Our Investment Vehicles 

We conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and other similar vehicles primarily through a partnership structure in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments and/or funds for investment from institutional investors and (to a limited extent) high-net worth individuals. Such commitments are generally drawn down from investors on an as-needed basis to fund investments over a specified term. All of our private equity and private real estate funds are commitment structured funds, except certain core+ and real estate debt funds, which are structured like hedge funds where all (or a portion) of the committed capital is funded on or promptly after the investor&#146;s subscription date and cash proceeds resulting from the disposition of investments can be reused indefinitely for further investment, subject to certain investor withdrawal rights. Our Real Estate business also includes a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust, or &#147;REIT,&#148; and a registered open-ended investment company complex, each of which is externally managed by a BREDS-owned adviser. Our credit-focused funds are generally commitment structured funds or open-ended where the investor&#146;s capital is fully funded into the fund upon or soon after the subscription for interests in the fund. Ten credit-focused vehicles that we manage or sub-advise in whole or in part are registered investment companies (including business development companies). The CLO vehicles we manage are structured investment vehicles that are generally private companies with limited liability. Most of our funds of hedge funds as well as our hedge funds are structured as funds where the investor&#146;s capital is fully funded into the fund upon the subscription for interests in the fund. Our private investment funds are generally organized as limited partnerships with respect to U.S. domiciled vehicles and limited liability (and other similar) companies with respect to non-U.S. domiciled vehicles. In the case of our separately managed accounts, the investor, rather than us, generally controls the investment vehicle that holds or has custody of the investments we advise the vehicle to make. 

Our investment funds, separately managed accounts and other vehicles are generally advised by a Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser that is registered under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or &#147;Advisers Act.&#148; Substantially all of the day-to-day operations of each investment vehicle are typically carried out by the Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory (or similar) agreement. Generally, the material terms of our investment advisory agreements relate to the scope of services to be rendered by the investment adviser to the applicable vehicle, the calculation of management fees to be borne by investors in our investment vehicles, the calculation of and the manner and extent to which other fees received by the investment adviser from funds or fund portfolio companies serve to offset or reduce the management fees payable by investors in our investment vehicles and certain rights of termination with respect to our investment advisory agreements. With the exception of the registered funds described below, the investment vehicles themselves do not generally register as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, or &#147;1940 Act,&#148; in reliance on the statutory exemptions provided by Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof or, typically in the case of vehicles formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exempts from its registration requirements investment vehicles privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are &#147;qualified purchasers&#148; as defined under the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act exempts from its registration requirements privately placed investment vehicles whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under current interpretations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), Section 7(d) of the 1940 Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment vehicle all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers. With respect to BXMT, which is externally managed by a BREDS-owned entity pursuant to a management agreement, it conducts its operations in a manner that allows it to maintain its REIT qualification and also avail itself of the statutory exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act for companies engaged primarily in investment in mortgages and other liens or investments in real estate. 

In some cases, one or more of our investment advisers, including GSO, BAAM and BREDS advisers, advises or sub-advises funds registered under the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

In addition to having an investment adviser, each investment fund that is a limited partnership, or &#147;partnership&#148; fund, also has a general partner that makes all operational and investment decisions relating to the conduct of the investment fund&#146;s business. Furthermore, all decisions concerning the making, monitoring and disposing of investments are made by the general partner. The limited partners of the partnership funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of the investment funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind the investment funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by the investment funds. These decisions are made by the investment fund&#146;s general partner in its sole discretion. With the exception of certain of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, certain credit-focused funds, and other funds or separately managed accounts for the benefit of one or more specified investors, third party investors in our funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote. In addition, the governing agreements of our investment funds provide that in the event certain &#147;key persons&#148; in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote in accordance with specified procedures, accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an investor-by-investor basis, or the fund&#146;s investment period will automatically terminate and the vote of a simple majority of investors is required to restart it. In addition, the governing agreements of some of our investment funds provide that investors have the right to terminate, for any reason, the investment period by a vote of 75% of the investors in such fund.

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of each of our carry funds generally receives an annual management fee based upon a percentage of the fund&#146;s capital commitments, invested capital and/or undeployed capital during the investment period and the fund&#146;s invested capital or investment fair value after the investment period, except that the investment advisers to certain of our credit-focused carry funds and core + real estate funds receive an annual management fee that is based upon a percentage of invested capital or net asset value throughout the term of the fund. These management fees are payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly) in the contractually prescribed amounts over the life of the fund. Depending on the base upon which management fees are calculated, negative performance of one or more investments in the fund may reduce the total management fee paid, but not the fee rate. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of each of our funds that are structured like hedge funds, or of our funds of hedge funds, registered mutual funds and separately managed accounts that invest in hedge funds, generally receives an annual management fee that is based upon a percentage of the fund&#146;s or account&#146;s net asset value. These management fees are also payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly). These funds often afford investors increased liquidity through annual, semi-annual or quarterly, or in the case of registered mutual funds, daily, withdrawal or redemption rights, in some cases following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn. The amount of management fees to which the investment adviser is entitled with respect thereto will proportionately increase as the net asset value of each investor&#146;s capital account grows and will proportionately decrease as the net asset value of each investor&#146;s capital account decreases. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of each of our CLOs and CDOs typically receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of each fund&#146;s total assets, subject to certain performance measures related to the underlying assets the vehicle owns, and additional management fees which are incentive-based (that is, subject to meeting certain return criteria). These management fees are also payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly). The term of each CLO and CDO varies from deal to deal and may be subject to early redemption or extension; typically, however, a CLO or CDO will be wound down within nine to eleven years of being launched. While the management fees tend to be approximately 0.5% per annum of each fund&#146;s total assets for the term of the deal, the quantum of fees will decrease as the fund deleverages toward the end of its term. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of our separately managed accounts typically receives annual management fees typically based upon a percentage of each account&#146;s net asset value or invested capital. The management fees we receive from our separately managed accounts are generally paid on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and may alternatively be based on invested capital or proportionately increase or decrease based on the net asset value of the separately managed account. The management fees we are paid for managing a separately managed account will generally be subject to contractual rights the investor has to terminate our management of an account on as short as 30 days&#146; prior notice. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of each of our credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies typically receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of each company&#146;s net asset value or total managed assets. The management fees we receive from the registered investment companies we manage are generally paid on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and proportionately increase or decrease based on the net asset value or gross assets of the investment company. The management fees we are paid for managing the investment company will generally be subject to contractual rights the company&#146;s board of directors (or, in the case of the business development company we manage, the investment adviser) has to terminate our management of an account on as short as 30 days&#146; prior notice. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The investment adviser of BXMT receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of BXMT&#146;s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated &#147;core earnings&#148; (which is generally equal to its net income, calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;), excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. The management fees we receive from managing BXMT are paid quarterly and increase or decrease based on, among other things, BXMT&#146;s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings (subject to certain adjustments). 

For additional information regarding the management fee rates we receive, see &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Critical Accounting Policies &#151; Revenue Recognition &#151; Management and Advisory Fees, Net.&#148; 

Incentive Fees 

The general partners or similar entities of each of our hedge fund structures receive performance-based allocation fees (&#147;incentive fees&#148;) of generally up to 20% of the applicable fund&#146;s net capital appreciation per annum, subject to certain net loss carry-forward (known as a &#147;high water mark&#148;) and/or other hurdle provisions. In some cases, the investment adviser of each of our funds of hedge funds, separately managed accounts that invest in hedge funds and certain non-U.S. registered investment companies is entitled to an incentive fee of generally up to 15% of the applicable investment vehicle&#146;s net appreciation, subject to a high water mark and in some cases a preferred return. In addition, for the business development companies we sub-advise, we receive incentive fees of 10% of the vehicle&#146;s net appreciation per annum (in certain cases paid quarterly), subject to a preferred return. The external manager of BXMT is entitled to an incentive fee, payable quarterly, in an amount, not less than zero, equal to the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) BXMT&#146;s core earnings for the previous 12-month period over (ii) an amount equal to 7% per annum multiplied by BXMT&#146;s average outstanding equity (as defined in the management agreement), provided that BXMT&#146;s core earnings over the prior three-year period is greater than zero. In addition, the general partner of certain BPP funds is entitled to an incentive fee allocation of up to 10% of excess profits, if any limited partner achieves a cumulative investment return in excess of a 7% hurdle rate. Incentive Fees are realized at the end of a measurement period, typically annually (but in certain real estate funds the measurement period is as long as three years). Once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback. 

Carried Interest 

The general partner or an affiliate of each of our carry funds also receives carried interest from the investment fund. Carried interest entitles the general partner (or an affiliate) to a preferred allocation of income and gains from a fund. Our ability to generate carried interest is an important element of our business and carried interest has historically accounted for a very significant portion of our income. 

&#160; 

The carried interest is typically structured as a net profits interest in the applicable fund. In the case of our carry funds, carried interest is calculated on a &#147;realized gain&#148; basis, and each general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest equal to 20% of the net realized income and gains (generally taking into account unrealized losses) generated by such fund, except that the general partners (or affiliates) of certain of our credit-focused funds, real estate debt funds, multi-asset class investment funds and secondary funds of funds are generally entitled to a carried interest that ranges from 10% to 20% depending on the specific fund. Net realized income or loss is not netted between or among funds. 

For most carry funds, the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred limited partner return ranging from 5% to 10%, subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner. If, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with respect to our real estate, real estate debt and certain multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds), as a result of diminished performance of later investments in a carry fund&#146;s life, (a) the general partner receives in excess of 20% (10% to 15% in the case of certain of our credit-focused and real estate debt carry funds, certain of our secondary funds of funds and certain multi-asset class investment funds) of the fund&#146;s net profits over the life of the fund, or (in certain cases) (b) the carry fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold, then we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the carried interest that was previously distributed to us that exceeds the amounts to which the relevant general partner we are ultimately entitled on an after tax basis. This obligation is known as a &#147;clawback&#148; obligation and is an obligation of any person who directly received such carried interest, including us and our employees who participate in our carried interest plans. 

Although a portion of any distributions by us to our unitholders may include any carried interest received by us, we do not intend to seek fulfillment of any clawback obligation by seeking to have our unitholders return any portion of such distributions attributable to carried interest associated with any clawback obligation. To the extent we are required to fulfill a clawback obligation, however, our general partner may determine to decrease the amount of our distributions to common unitholders. The clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry fund&#146;s own net investment performance only and carried interest of other funds is not netted for determining this contingent obligation. Moreover, although a clawback obligation is several, the governing agreements of most of our funds provide that to the extent another recipient of carried interest (such as a current or former employee) does not fund his or her respective share of the clawback obligation then due, then we and our employees who participate in such carried interest plans may have to fund additional amounts (generally an additional 50-67%) although we retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We have recorded a contingent repayment obligation equal to the amount that would be due on December 31, 2015, if the various carry funds were liquidated at their current carrying value. 

For additional information concerning the clawback obligations we could face, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; We may not have sufficient cash to pay back &#145;clawback&#146; obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors.&#148; 

Advisory Fees 

Many of our investment advisers, especially private equity and real estate advisers, receive customary fees (for example, acquisition fees or origination fees) upon consummation of many of the funds&#146; transactions, receive monitoring fees from many of the funds&#146; portfolio companies for continued advice from the investment adviser, and may from time to time receive disposition and other fees in connection with their activities. The acquisition fees that they receive are generally calculated as a percentage (that generally can range up to 1%) of the total enterprise value of the acquired entity. Most of our carry funds are required to reduce the management fees charged to their limited partner investors by 50% to 100% of such limited partner&#146;s share of the transaction fees and certain other fees that they receive. 

Capital Invested In and Alongside Our Investment Funds 

To further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds, we have invested the firm&#146;s capital and that of our personnel in the investment funds we sponsor and manage. Minimum general partner capital 

&#160; 

commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to our investment funds and, generally, are less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of any particular fund. See &#147;Part II. Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Liquidity Needs&#148; for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. We determine whether to make general partner capital commitments to our funds in excess of the minimum required commitments based on a variety of factors, including estimates regarding liquidity over the estimated time period during which commitments will be funded, estimates regarding the amounts of capital that may be appropriate for other opportunities or other funds we may be in the process of raising or are considering raising, prevailing industry standards with respect to sponsor commitments and our general working capital requirements. In many cases, we require our senior managing directors and other professionals to fund a portion of the general partner capital commitments to our funds. In other cases, we may from time to time offer to our senior managing directors and employees a part of the funded or unfunded general partner commitments to our investment funds. Our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or deferral of management fees. 

Investors in many of our funds also receive the opportunity to make additional &#147;co-investments&#148; with the investment funds. Our personnel, as well as Blackstone itself, also have the opportunity to make co-investments, which we refer to as &#147;side-by-side investments,&#148; with many of our carry funds. Co-investments and side-by-side investments are investments in portfolio companies or other assets on the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable fund. Co-investments refer to investments arranged by us that are made by our limited partner investors (and other investors in some instances) in a portfolio company or other assets alongside an investment fund. In certain cases, limited partner investors may pay additional management fees or carried interest in connection with such co-investments. Side-by-side investments are similar to co-investments but are made by directors, officers, senior managing directors, employees and certain affiliates of Blackstone. These investments are generally made pursuant to a binding election, subject to certain limitations, made once a year for the estimated activity during the ensuing 12 months under which those persons are permitted to make investments alongside a particular carry fund in all transactions of that fund for that year. Side-by-side investments are funded in cash and are not generally subject to management fees or carried interest. 

Competition 

The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete both globally and on a regional, industry and niche basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including investment performance, transaction execution skills, access to capital, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products and services, innovation and price. 

We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our investment funds and in acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies and making other investments. With respect to outside investors, many have increased the amount of commitments they are making to alternative investment funds. However, any increase in the allocation of amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies by institutional and individual investors could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many of our investment funds seek to exploit. Certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. Such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients. 

Depending on the investment, we face competition primarily from sponsors managing other private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds and other pools of capital, other financial institutions including sovereign wealth funds, corporate buyers and other parties. Several of these competitors have significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources or other resources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. Competitors may also be subject to different regulatory regimes or rules that may provide them more flexibility or better access to pursue transactions or raise capital for their investment funds. 

&#160; 

In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make. Corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings with regard to an investment or be perceived by sellers as otherwise being more desirable bidders, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment. 

In all of our businesses, competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. 

For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business &#151; The asset management business is intensely competitive.&#148; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 2,060 people, including our 104 senior managing directors and approximately 790 other investment professionals. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, integrity and cooperation among our employees. 

Regulatory and Compliance Matters 

Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. 

All of the investment advisers of our investment funds operating in the U.S. are registered as investment advisers with the SEC (other investment advisers are registered in non-U.S. jurisdictions). Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. 

Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P., a subsidiary of ours through which we conduct our capital markets services business and certain of our fund marketing and distribution, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or &#147;FINRA,&#148; and is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including our broker-dealer entity. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over our broker-dealer entity. 

Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including the implementation of a supervisory control system over the securities business, sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public and private securities offerings, use and safekeeping of customers&#146; funds and securities, maintenance of adequate net capital, record keeping, the financing of customers&#146; purchases and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is subject to the SEC&#146;s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer&#146;s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the capital structure of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC&#146;s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, or &#147;FSMA,&#148; certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;). The Blackstone Group International Partners LLP (&#147;BGIP&#148;) and GSO Capital Partners International LLP (&#147;GSO International&#148;) are both authorized and regulated by the FCA in the United Kingdom. The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder from the cornerstone of legislation which governs all aspects of our investment business in the United Kingdom, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, record keeping, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures. 

In addition, each of the closed-end and open-end mutual funds and investment management companies we manage is registered under the 1940 Act. The mutual funds and investment management companies and the entities that serve as those vehicles&#146; investment advisers are subject to the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. 

Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Management Europe Limited is authorized by the Central Bank of Ireland and is authorized to act as a manager of Irish non-UCITS Collective Investment Schemes. Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Management Europe II Limited is authorized by the Central Bank of Ireland as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager. Certain Blackstone operating entities are licensed and subject to regulation by financial regulatory authorities in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore: The Blackstone Group Japan K.K., a financial instruments firm, is registered with Kanto Local Finance Bureau (Kin-sho) and regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency; The Blackstone Group (HK) Limited is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission; The Blackstone Group (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 149 142 058 holds an Australian financial services license authorizing it to provide financial services in Australia (AFSL 408376), and is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and The Blackstone Singapore Pte. Ltd is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (Company Registration Number: 201020503E). 

The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations have in recent years increased their regulatory activities, including regulation, examination and enforcement in respect of asset management firms. 

As described above, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, marketing of investment products, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. 

Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is important to our culture and risk management. Our Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, together with the Chief Compliance Officers of each of our businesses, supervise our compliance group, which is responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures such as oversight compliance, codes of conduct, compliance systems, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance risks such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, marketing practices, valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, document retention, potential conflicts of interest, the allocation of investment opportunities, collection of fees and expense allocation. 

Our compliance group also monitors the information barriers that we maintain between the public and private side of Blackstone&#146;s businesses. We believe that our various businesses&#146; access to the intellectual knowledge and 

&#160; 

contacts and relationships that reside throughout our firm benefits all of our businesses. To maximize that access without compromising our compliance with our legal and contractual obligations, our compliance group oversees and monitors the communications between groups that are on the private side of our information barrier and groups that are on the public side, as well as between different public side groups. Our compliance group also monitors contractual obligations that may be impacted and potential conflicts that may arise in connection with these inter-group discussions. 

In addition, disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are documented, tested and assessed for design and operating effectiveness in compliance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;Sarbanes-Oxley&#148;). We have an Internal Audit department with a global mandate and dedicated resources that provides risk-based audit, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and advisory practices. Internal Audit, which reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner, aims to provide reasonable, independent, and objective assurance to our management and the board of directors of our general partner that risks are well managed and that controls are appropriate and effective. 

Our enterprise risk management practices include review and monitoring of our business, investment and other key risks at various levels, including at the fund, business unit and corporate level. Committees comprised of members of management and representatives of various business units and corporate functions consider and evaluate legal, reputational, operational, control and other risks attendant to our business. In addition, senior management regularly reports to the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner on risk matters, including by providing periodic risk reports, an overview of management&#146;s view of key risks to the firm and detailed assessments of selected risks. 

There are a number of pending or recently enacted legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States and in Europe that could significantly affect our business. Please see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business &#151; Regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business&#148; and &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business &#151; Recent regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.&#148;
