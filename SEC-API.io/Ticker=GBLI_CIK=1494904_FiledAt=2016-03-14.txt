History 

Global Indemnity plc (&#147;Global Indemnity&#148; or &#147;the Company&#148;) was incorporated on March 9, 2010 and is domiciled in Ireland as a public limited company. In July 2010, Global Indemnity replaced the Company&#146;s predecessor, United America Indemnity, Ltd., a Cayman Island company, as the ultimate parent company as a result of a re-domestication transaction. The Company&#146;s A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol &#147;GBLI.&#148; 

On January 1, 2015, Global Indemnity Group, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, acquired 100% of the voting equity interest of American Reliable Insurance Company (&#147;American Reliable&#148;) from American Bankers Insurance Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Assurant,Inc., by paying $113.7 million in cash and assuming $283.9 million of customary insurance related liabilities, obligations, and mandates. Per the American Reliable Stock Purchase Agreement (&#147;American Reliable SPA&#148;), the ultimate purchase price is subject to (i) accounting procedures that were performed in 2015 to determine GAAP book value and (ii) indemnification on future development on recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014. In accordance with the American Reliable SPA, on the third calendar year following the calendar year of the closing, if loss and loss adjustment expenses for accident years 2014 and prior are lower than recorded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014, Global Indemnity Group, Inc. will pay the variance to American Bankers Group, Inc. Conversely, if loss and loss adjustment expenses for accident years 2014 and prior exceed recorded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014, American Bankers Group, Inc. will pay the variance to Global Indemnity Group, Inc. In accordance with a dispute resolution agreement between Global Indemnity Group, Inc. and American Bankers Group, Inc., any variance paid related to the loss indemnification will be subject to interest of 5% compounded semi-annually. The Company&#146;s current estimate of the purchase price, based on available financial information, is approximately $99.8 million. 

Please see &#147;Recent Developments&#148; in Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information on the acquisition of American Reliable. 

General 

Global Indemnity, one of the leading specialty property and casualty insurers in the industry, provides its insurance products across a distribution network that includes binding authority, program, brokerage, and reinsurance. Starting in the 1 st quarter of 2015, the Company manages the distribution of these products through three reportable business segments: Commercial Lines, managed in Bala Cynwyd, PA, offers specialty property and casualty products designed for product lines such as Small Business Binding Authority, Property Brokerage, and Programs; Personal Lines, managed in Scottsdale, AZ, offers specialty personal lines and agricultural coverage; and Reinsurance Operations, managed in Bermuda, provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and primary writers including insurance and reinsurance companies. The Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments comprise the Company&#146;s U.S. Insurance Operations (&#147;Insurance Operations&#148;). 

&#160; 

Prior to 2015, the Commercial Lines segment was known as Insurance Operations segment. With the acquisition of American Reliable, the Insurance Operations segment was renamed to Commercial Lines segment. The newly acquired American Reliable became the Company&#146;s Personal Lines segment. For segment reporting, the values for 2013 and 2014 did not change for Commercial Lines and Reinsurance Operations. 

Business Segments 

See Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for gross and net premiums written, income and total assets of each operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For a discussion of the variances between years, see &#147;Results of Operations&#148; in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Personal Lines 

The Company&#146;s Personal Lines distribute property and casualty insurance products and operate primarily in the admitted markets. In the standard property and casualty insurance market, insurance rates and forms are highly regulated; products and coverage are largely uniform and have relatively predictable exposures. In the standard market, policies must be written by insurance companies that are admitted to transact business in the state in which the policy is issued. As a result, in the standard property and casualty insurance market, insurance companies tend to compete for customers primarily on the basis of price, coverage, value-added service, and financial strength. 

The Company&#146;s Personal Lines writes specialty products such as agriculture, mobile homes, manufactured homes, homeowners, and watersports via American Reliable. These products are distributed through retail agents, wholesale general agents, and brokers. The insurance products are either underwritten via specific binding authority or by internal personnel. 

See &#147;Underwriting&#148; below for additional discussion on how the Company&#146;s insurance products are underwritten. 

Gross premiums written for the Personal Lines were $326.3 million in 2015. Personal lines is a new business segment in 2015 resulting from the acquisition of American Reliable on January 1, 2015. 

Commercial Lines 

The Company&#146;s Commercial Lines distribute property and casualty insurance products and operate predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. The excess and surplus lines market differs significantly from the standard property and casualty insurance market. 

The excess and surplus lines market provides coverage for businesses that often do not fit the underwriting criteria of an insurance company operating in the standard markets due to their relatively greater unpredictable loss patterns and unique niches of exposure requiring rate and policy form flexibility. Without the excess and surplus lines market, certain businesses would have to self-insure their exposures, or seek coverage outside the U.S. market. 

Competition in the excess and surplus lines market tends to focus less on price and more on availability, service, and other considerations. While excess and surplus lines market exposures may have higher perceived insurance risk than their standard market counterparts, excess and surplus lines market underwriters historically have been able to generate underwriting profitability superior to standard market underwriters. 

A portion of the Company&#146;s Commercial Lines is written on a specialty admitted basis. When writing on a specialty admitted basis, the Company&#146;s focus is on writing insurance for insureds that engage in similar but often highly specialized types of activities. The specialty admitted market is subject to greater state regulation 

&#160; 

than the surplus lines market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements and the ability to enter and exit lines of business. Insureds purchasing coverage from specialty admitted insurance companies do so because the insurance product is not otherwise available from standard market insurers. Yet, for regulatory or marketing reasons, these insureds require products that are written by an admitted insurance company. 

The Commercial Lines&#146; insurance products target specific, defined groups of insureds with customized coverage to meet their needs. To manage operations, the Commercial Lines segment differentiates its products by product classification. These product classifications are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Penn-America Group distributes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; United National Group distributes property, general liability, and professional lines products through program administrators with specific binding authority; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Diamond State Group distributes property, casualty, and professional lines products through wholesale brokers that are underwritten by the Company&#146;s personnel and selected brokers with specific binding authority. 

These product classifications comprise the Commercial Lines business segment and are not considered individual business segments because each product has similar economic characteristics, distribution, and coverage. 

The Company&#146;s Commercial Lines provide property, casualty, and professional liability products utilizing customized guidelines, rates, and forms tailored to the Company&#146;s risk and underwriting philosophy. See &#147;Underwriting&#148; below for a discussion on how the Company&#146;s insurance products are underwritten. 

In 2015, gross premiums written for the Commercial Lines were $214.2 million compared to $230.0 million for 2014. For 2015, surplus lines business accounts for approximately 77.7% of the business written while specialty admitted business accounts for the remaining 22.3%. 

Reinsurance Operations 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (&#147;Global Indemnity Reinsurance&#148;) is a Bermuda based treaty reinsurer of specialty property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. The Company&#146;s Reinsurance Operations segment provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and primary writers including insurance and reinsurance companies, and consists solely of the operations of Global Indemnity Reinsurance. 

The reinsurance markets face many of the same issues confronted in the primary insurance markets including excess capital capacity, low investment returns and increased pressure on generating acceptable return on investment. 

The limited number of catastrophic events in recent years and an increase in the available capacity has continued to put pressure on pricing levels. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is focused on using its capital capacity to write catastrophe-oriented placements and other niche or specialty-focused excess of loss contracts meeting the Company&#146;s risk tolerance and return thresholds. 

In 2015, gross premiums written from third parties were $49.7 million compared to $61.3 million for 2014. 

Products and Product Development 

The Company&#146;s U.S. Insurance Operations distribute property and casualty insurance products. Its Personal Lines operate primarily in the admitted marketplace; whereas, its Commercial Lines operate predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. To manage its operations, the Company seeks to differentiate its products 

&#160; 

by product classification. See &#147;Personal Lines&#148; and &#147;Commercial Lines&#148; above for a description of these product classifications. The U.S. Insurance Operations are licensed to write on a surplus lines (non-admitted) basis and/or an admitted basis in all 50 U.S. States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which provides the Company with flexibility in designing products and programs, and in determining rates to meet emerging risks and discontinuities in the marketplace. 

The Company&#146;s Reinsurance Operations offer third party treaty reinsurance for specialty property and casualty insurance companies and reinsurance companies as well as professional liability products to companies. The Company&#146;s Reinsurance Operations also provide reinsurance to its Insurance Operations in the form of quota share and stop-loss arrangements.

&#160; Marketing and Distribution 

The Company provides its insurance products across a full distribution network&#151;binding authority, program, brokerage, direct, and reinsurance. For its binding authority and program product classifications, the Company distributes its insurance products primarily through a group of wholesale general agents and program administrators that have specific quoting and binding authority. For its brokerage business, the Company distributes its insurance products through wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell the Company&#146;s insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. For its reinsurance business, the Company distributes its products through reinsurance brokers and on a direct basis. 

The Company&#146;s Commercial Lines distributes its insurance products primarily through a group of approximately 120 wholesale general agents and program administrators. Of the Commercial Lines&#146; non-affiliated professional wholesale general agents and program administrators, the top five accounted for 34.3% of the Commercial Lines&#146; gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2015. One agency represented 10.6% of the Commercial Lines&#146; gross premiums written. 

The Company&#146;s Personal Lines distributes specialty personal and agricultural insurance products through a group of approximately 290 agents primarily comprised of wholesale general agents. It also distributes its specialty personal insurance products on a retail basis in New Mexico and Arizona. Of the Personal Lines&#146; 

&#160; 

non-affiliated professional wholesale general agents and retail agents, the top five accounted for 20.5% of the Personal Lines&#146; gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2015. No one agency represented more than 10% of the Personal Lines&#146; gross premiums written. 

There is no agency which accounts for more than 10% of the Company&#146;s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance assumed premiums on three treaties accounted for 95% of the Reinsurance Operations&#146; 2015 gross premiums written. There is no treaty that accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#146;s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company&#146;s primary distribution strategy is to seek to maintain strong relationships with a limited number of high-quality wholesale professional general agents and wholesale insurance brokers. The Company carefully selects distribution sources based on their expertise, experience and reputation. The Company believes that its distribution strategy enables it to effectively access numerous markets at a relatively low cost structure through the marketing, underwriting, and administrative support of the Company&#146;s professional general agencies and wholesale insurance brokers. The Company believes these wholesale general agents and wholesale insurance brokers have local market knowledge and expertise that enables them to access business in these markets more effectively. 

Underwriting 

For Commercial Lines, the Company&#146;s insurance products are primarily underwritten via specific binding authority in which the Company grants underwriting authority to its wholesale general agents and program administrators and via brokerage in which the Company&#146;s internal personnel underwrites business submitted by wholesale insurance brokers. Some of the Company&#146;s specialized property business is submitted by retail agents or directly from insureds and is also underwritten by internal personnel. 

For Personal Lines, the Company&#146;s insurance products are distributed through retail agents, wholesale general agents, and brokers. The insurance products are either underwritten via specific binding authority or by internal personnel. 

Specific Binding Authority &#151;The Company&#146;s wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators for both Commercial Lines and Personal Lines have specific quoting and binding authority with respect to a single insurance product and some have limited quoting and binding authority with respect to multiple products. 

The Company&#146;s wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators will either utilize company administered policy systems with the Company&#146;s underwriting guidelines embedded within the system or the agents will use their own proprietary systems. When the agents use their own proprietary systems, the Company provides its wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators with a comprehensive, regularly updated underwriting manual that specifically outlines risk eligibility which is developed based on the type of insured, nature of exposure and overall expected profitability. This manual also outlines (a) premium pricing, (b) underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to policy forms, terms and conditions, and (c) policy issuance instructions. 

The Company&#146;s wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators are appointed to underwrite submissions received in accordance with the Company&#146;s underwriting manual. Risks that are not within the specific binding authority must be submitted to the Company&#146;s underwriting personnel directly for underwriting review and approval or denial of the application of the insured. The Company&#146;s wholesale general agents provide all policy issuance services in accordance with the Company&#146;s underwriting manuals. 

&#160; 

Agricultural partners are not provided with underwriting manuals. Rather, they are provided with letters of authority; whereby, policies and endorsement issuance rights are extended. 

The Company regularly monitors the underwriting quality of its wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators through a disciplined system of controls, which includes the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; automated system criteria edits and exception reports; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; individual policy reviews to measure adherence to the Company&#146;s underwriting manual including: risk selection, underwriting compliance, policy issuance and pricing; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; periodic on-site comprehensive audits to evaluate processes, controls, profitability and adherence to all aspects of the Company&#146;s underwriting manual including: risk selection, underwriting compliance, policy issuance and pricing; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; internal quarterly actuarial analysis of loss ratios produced by business underwritten by the Company&#146;s wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; internal quarterly analysis of financial results, including premium growth and overall profitability of business produced by the Company&#146;s wholesale general agents, retail agents, and program administrators. 

The Company provides incentives to certain of its wholesale general agents and program administrators to produce profitable business through contingent profit commission structures that are tied directly to the achievement of profitability targets. 

Brokerage &#151;There are only three wholesale insurance brokers with specific binding authority. These brokers are within the Company&#146;s Commercial Lines and are subject to the same guidelines and monitoring as discussed above. The majority of the Company&#146;s wholesale insurance brokers do not have specific binding authority; therefore, these risks are submitted to the Company&#146;s underwriting personnel for review and processing. 

The Company provides its underwriters with a comprehensive, regularly updated underwriting manual that outlines risk eligibility which is developed based on the type of insured, nature of exposure and overall expected profitability. This manual also outlines (a) premium pricing, (b) underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to policy forms, terms and conditions. 

The Company&#146;s underwriting personnel review submissions, issue all quotes and perform all policy issuance functions. The Company regularly monitors the underwriting quality of its underwriters through a disciplined system of controls, which includes the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; individual policy reviews to measure the Company&#146;s underwriters&#146; adherence to the underwriting manual including: risk selection, underwriting compliance, policy issuance and pricing; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; periodic underwriting review to evaluate adherence to all aspects of the Company&#146;s underwriting manual including: risk selection, underwriting compliance, policy issuance and pricing; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; internal quarterly actuarial analysis of loss ratios produced by business underwritten by the Company&#146;s underwriters; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; internal quarterly analysis of financial results, including premium growth and overall profitability of business produced by the Company&#146;s underwriters. 

Reinsurance&#151; The Company&#146;s Global Indemnity Reinsurance subsidiary primarily offers retrocessional coverage to Bermuda based reinsurance companies. The business assumed is primarily quota share treaties on property catastrophe and marine business. The Company also writes a small amount of professional lines excess liability business. Prior to entering into any agreement, the Company evaluates a number of factors for each cedent including, but not limited to, reputation and financial condition, underwriting and claims practices and historical claims experience. The Company also models proposed treaties for both the catastrophe exposure and the marginal impact on the Company&#146;s existing catastrophe portfolio. 

&#160; 

Contingent Commissions 

Certain professional general agencies of the U.S. Insurance Operations are paid special incentives, referred to as contingent commissions, when results of business produced by these agencies are more favorable than predetermined thresholds. Similarly, in some circumstances, companies that cede business to the Reinsurance Operations are paid a profit commission based on the profitability of the ceded portfolio. These commissions are charged to other underwriting expenses when incurred. 

Pricing 

The Company&#146;s pricing actuaries establish pricing tailored to each specific product it underwrites, taking into account historical loss experience, historical rate level changes, and individual risk and coverage characteristics. The Company generally uses the actuarial loss costs promulgated by the Insurance Services Office as a benchmark in the development of pricing for most of the Company&#146;s products. Specific products will utilize proprietary rating when deemed appropriate. The Company will seek to only write business if it believes it can achieve an adequate rate of return. 

Reinsurance of Underwriting Risk 

The Company&#146;s philosophy is to purchase reinsurance from third parties to limit its liability on individual risks and to protect against property catastrophe and casualty clash losses. Reinsurance assists the Company in controlling exposure to severe losses and protecting capital resources. The type, cost and limits of reinsurance it purchases can vary from year to year based upon the Company&#146;s desired retention levels and the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of limits on the policies it has written, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the insurance ceded. The Company&#146;s reinsurance contracts renew throughout the year and all of its reinsurance is purchased following guidelines established by management. The Company primarily utilizes treaty reinsurance products made up of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance. Additionally, the Company may purchase facultative reinsurance protection on single risks when deemed necessary. 

The Company purchases specific types and structures of reinsurance depending upon the characteristics of the lines of business and specialty products underwritten. The Company will typically seek to place proportional reinsurance for umbrella and excess products, certain specialty products, or in the development stages of a new product. The Company believes that this approach allows it to control net exposure in these product areas most cost effectively. 

The Company purchases reinsurance on an excess of loss basis to cover individual risk severity. These structures are utilized to protect the Company&#146;s primary positions on property and casualty products. The excess of loss structures allow the Company to maximize underwriting profits over time by retaining a greater portion of the risk in these products, while helping to protect against the possibility of unforeseen volatility. 

The Company analyzes its reinsurance contracts to ensure that they meet the risk transfer requirements of applicable accounting guidance, which requires that the reinsurer must assume significant insurance risk under the reinsured portions of the underlying insurance contracts and that there must be a reasonably possible chance that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the transaction. 

The Company continually evaluates its retention levels across its entire line of business and specialty product portfolio seeking to ensure that the ultimate reinsurance structures are aligned with the Company&#146;s corporate risk tolerance levels associated with such products. Any decision to decrease the Company&#146;s reliance upon proportional reinsurance or to increase the Company&#146;s excess of loss retentions could increase the Company&#146;s earnings volatility. In cases where the Company decides to increase its excess of loss retentions, such decisions will be a result of a change or progression in the Company&#146;s risk tolerance level. The Company endeavors to 

&#160; 

purchase reinsurance from financially strong reinsurers with which it has long-standing relationships. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Company holds collateral, including letters of credit, under reinsurance agreements. 

The Company&#146;s Insurance Operations&#146; primary reinsurance treaties are as follows: 

Property Catastrophe Excess of Loss &#151;The Company&#146;s current property writings create exposure to catastrophic events. To protect against these exposures, the Company purchases a property catastrophe treaty. Effective June 1, 2015, the Company purchased a property catastrophe excess of loss treaty which provides occurrence coverage for losses of $280 million in excess of $20 million. This treaty is made up of three layers: $20 million in excess of $20 million, which the Company participated on 25% of the placement, $60 million in excess of $40 million, and $200 million in excess of $100 million. This treaty provides for one full reinstatement of coverage at 100% additional premium as to time and pro rata as to amount of limit reinstated. This replaced the treaty which expired on May 31, 2015, which provided occurrence coverage for losses of $70 million in excess of $20 million. This treaty excluded business underwritten by American Reliable. The Company participated on 60% of the $20 million in excess of $20 million layer and 40% of the $50 million in excess of $40 million layer. This treaty provided for one full reinstatement of coverage at 100% additional premium as to time and pro rata as to amount of limit reinstated. 

Earthquake Property Catastrophe Excess of Loss &#151;Effective January 1, 2015, the Company purchased an earthquake property catastrophe excess of loss treaty which provided occurrence coverage for earthquake catastrophe losses of $30 million in excess of $5 million for American Reliable property business. This treaty provided for one full reinstatement of coverage at 100% additional premium as to time and pro rata as to amount of limit reinstated. This treaty was cancelled on May 31, 2015 and rolled into a new combined master catastrophe treaty which was effective June 1, 2015. 

Property Per Risk Excess of Loss &#151;Effective January 1, 2016, the Company renewed its property per risk excess of loss treaty. This treaty provides coverage in three sections: 80% of $9 million per risk in excess of $1 million per risk for all business except the Property Brokerage unit and business written by American Reliable, 100% of $4 million per risk in excess of $1 million per risk for American Reliable business, and 75% of $8 million per risk in excess of $2 million per risk for Property Brokerage business. This treaty also provides coverage of 100% of $20 million per risk in excess of $10 million per risk for Property Brokerage business. The treaty&#146;s liability is limited to twice the named per risk limit by section and layer for all risks involved in one loss occurrence. This replaced the treaty which expired December 31, 2015, which excluded business underwritten by American Reliable. This treaty provided coverage in two sections: 50% of $9 million per risk in excess of $1 million per risk for all business with the exception of the Property Brokerage unit, and 50% of $8 million per risk in excess of $2 million per risk for Property Brokerage business. This treaty also provides coverage of 100% of $20 million per risk in excess of $10 million per risk for Property Brokerage business. The treaty&#146;s liability was limited to twice the named per risk limit by section and layer for all risks involved in one loss occurrence. 

American Reliable Property Per Risk Excess of Loss &#151;Effective January 1, 2015, American Reliable renewed its property per risk excess of loss treaty covering business underwritten by American Reliable. This treaty provides coverage in two layers: $1 million per risk in excess of $1 million per risk, and $3 million per risk in excess of $2 million per risk. The first layer is subject to a $2 million limit of liability for all risks involved in one loss occurrence, and the second layer is subject to a $6 million limit for all risks involved in one loss occurrence. This treaty expired on December 31, 2015 and the American Reliable business was added to the Property Per Risk Excess of Loss treaty described above. 

Casualty and Professional Liability Excess of Loss &#151;Effective May 1, 2015, the Company renewed its casualty and professional liability excess of loss treaty. The casualty section provides coverage for 50% of $2 million per occurrence in excess of $1 million per occurrence for general liability and auto liability. The professional liability section provides coverage for 50% of $4 million per policy/occurrence in excess of $1 million per policy/occurrence. For both sections, allocated loss adjustment expenses are included within limits. This replaced the casualty and professional liability treaty that expired April 30, 2015 which provided for 100% of the identical coverage limits and retentions. 

&#160; 

Casualty Clash Excess of Loss &#151;Effective May 1, 2015, the Company renewed its casualty clash excess of loss treaty which provides coverage of $10 million per occurrence in excess of $3 million per occurrence, subject to a $20 million limit for all loss occurrences. The casualty clash treaty that expired April 30, 2015 provided identical coverage. 

100% Ceded Quota Share to American Bankers &#151;Effective December 1, 2014, American Reliable entered into four treaties to cede 100% of its liabilities related to certain businesses to American Bankers Insurance Company that were not included in the acquisition of American Reliable. For the year ended December 31, 2015, American Reliable recorded ceded written premiums and ceded earned premiums of $55.8 million and $59.5 million, respectively, to American Bankers Insurance Company. 

100% Assumed Quota Share from American Bankers &#151;Effective December 1, 2014, American Reliable entered into two treaties to assume 100% of its liabilities from various insurers owned by Assurant, Inc. for business included in the acquisition but not written directly by American Reliable. For the year ended December 31, 2015, American Reliable recorded assumed written premiums and assumed earned premiums of $82.3 million and $92.7 million, respectively, from insurance companies owned by Assurant, Inc. 

To the extent that there may be an increase or decrease in catastrophe or casualty clash exposure in the future, the Company may increase or decrease its reinsurance protection for these exposures commensurately. There were no other significant changes to any of the Company&#146;s Insurance Operations&#146; reinsurance treaties during 2015. 

The following table sets forth the ten reinsurers for which the Company has the largest reinsurance receivables as of December 31, 2015. Also shown are the amounts of premiums ceded by the Company to these reinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company carried reinsurance receivables, net of collateral held in trust, of $109.2 million. This amount is net of a purchase accounting adjustment and an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance receivables. The purchase accounting adjustment resulted from the Company&#146;s acquisition of Wind River Investment Corporation on September 5, 2003 and is related to discounting the acquired loss reserves to their present value and applying a risk margin to the discounted reserves. This adjustment was $3.0 million at December 31, 2015. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance receivables was $9.7 million at December 31, 2015. 

Historically, there have been insolvencies following a period of competitive pricing in the industry. While the Company has recorded allowances for reinsurance receivables based on currently available information, conditions may change or additional information might be obtained that may require the Company to record additional allowances. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its financial exposure to the reinsurance market and assesses the adequacy of its collateral and allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The Company continues to take actions to mitigate its exposure to possible loss. 

Claims Management and Administration 

The Company&#146;s approach to claims management is designed to investigate reported incidents at the earliest juncture, to select, manage, and supervise all legal and adjustment aspects of claims, including settlement, for the mutual benefit of the Company, its professional general agents, wholesale brokers, reinsurers and insureds. The Company&#146;s professional general agents and wholesale brokers have no authority to settle claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process, with the exception of one statutory managing general agent and one general agent. The Insurance Operations&#146; claims management staff supervises or processes all claims. The Company&#146;s Insurance Operations has a formal claims review process, and all claims greater than $100,000 for Personal Lines and $250,000 for Commercial Lines, gross of reinsurance, are reviewed by senior claims management and certain senior executives. Large loss trends and analysis are reviewed by a Large Loss committee. 

To handle claims, the Company&#146;s Insurance Operations utilizes its own in-house claims department as well as third-party claims administrators (&#147;TPAs&#148;) and assuming reinsurers, to whom it delegates limited claims handling authority. The Insurance Operations&#146; experienced in-house staff of claims management professionals are assigned to one of five dedicated claim units: casualty and automobile claims, latent exposure claims, property claims, TPA oversight, and a wholly owned subsidiary that administers construction defect claims. The dedicated claims units meet regularly to communicate current developments within their assigned areas of specialty. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $175 million of direct outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense case reserves at its Insurance Operations. Claims relating to approximately 89% of those reserves are handled by in-house claims management professionals, while claims relating to approximately 3% of those reserves are handled by TPAs, which send the Company detailed financial and claims information on a monthly basis. The Company also individually supervises in-house any significant or complicated TPA handled claims, and conducts on-site audits of material TPAs at least twice a year. Approximately 8% of its reserves are handled by the Company&#146;s assuming reinsurers. The Company reviews and supervises the claims handled by its reinsurers seeking to protect its reputation and minimize exposure. 

Reserves for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Applicable insurance laws require the Company to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate losses under insurance policies and reinsurance treaties that it writes and for loss adjustment expenses relating to the investigation and settlement of claims. 

The Company establishes loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for individual claims by evaluating reported claims on the basis of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; the severity of injury or damage; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; jurisdiction of the occurrence; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the potential for ultimate exposure; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; litigation related developments; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the type of loss; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Company&#146;s experience with the insured and the line of business and policy provisions relating to the particular type of claim. 

The Company generally estimates such losses and claims costs through an evaluation of individual reported claims. The Company also establishes reserves for incurred but not reported losses (&#147;IBNR&#148;). IBNR reserves are based in part on statistical information and in part on industry experience with respect to the expected number and nature of claims arising from occurrences that have not been reported. The Company also establishes its reserves based on estimates of future trends in claims severity and other subjective factors. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred. Reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis other than fair value adjustments recorded under purchase accounting. The Company&#146;s Insurance Operations&#146; reserves are reviewed quarterly by the in-house actuarial staff. Loss reserve estimates for the Company&#146;s Reinsurance Operations are developed by independent, external actuaries; however management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections. The data for this analysis is organized by treaty and treaty year. Reviews for both Insurance Operations and Reinsurance Operations are performed both gross and net of reinsurance. 

In addition to the Company&#146;s internal reserve analysis, independent external actuaries perform a full, detailed review of the Insurance Operations&#146; reserves annually. The Company does not rely upon the review by the independent actuaries to develop its reserves; however, the data is used to corroborate the analysis performed by the in-house actuarial staff. The Company&#146;s independent external actuaries also perform a full, detailed review of the Reinsurance Operations&#146; reserves annually. The results of the detailed reserve reviews by internal and external actuaries were summarized and discussed with the Company&#146;s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. 

With respect to some classes of risks, the period of time between the occurrence of an insured event and the final resolution of a claim may be many years, and during this period it often becomes necessary to adjust the claim estimates either upward or downward. Certain classes of umbrella and excess liability that the Company underwrites have historically had longer intervals between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claim and final resolution. In such cases, the Company must estimate reserves over long periods of time with the possibility of several adjustments to reserves. Other classes of insurance that the Company underwrites, such as most property insurance, historically have shorter intervals between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claim and final resolution. Reserves with respect to these classes are therefore inherently less likely to be adjusted. 

The loss and loss expense reserving process is intended to reflect the impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss payments by taking into account changes in historical payment patterns and perceived trends. However, there is no precise method for the subsequent evaluation of the adequacy of the consideration given to inflation, or to any other specific factor, or to the way one factor may affect another. 

The loss and loss adjustment expense development table that follows shows changes in the Company&#146;s reserves in subsequent years from the prior loss and loss expense estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year and in conformity with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of losses for individual years. A redundancy means the original estimate was higher than the current estimate; a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate. 

&#160; 

The first line of the loss and loss adjustment expense development table shows, for the years indicated, the Company&#146;s net reserve liability including the reserve for IBNR. The first section of the table shows, by year, the cumulative amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid as of the end of each succeeding year. The second section sets forth the re-estimates in later years of incurred losses and loss expenses, including payments, for the years indicated. The &#147;cumulative redundancy/ (deficiency)&#148; represents, as of the date indicated, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated. 

On January 1, 2015, the acquisition of American Reliable was completed. Consequently, American Reliable&#146;s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are only in the 2015 year in the table below.

&#160; See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for a reconciliation of the Company&#146;s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance ceded, as well as further discussion surrounding changes to reserves for prior accident years. 

Asbestos and Environmental Exposure 

The Company&#146;s environmental exposure arises from the sale of general liability and commercial multi-peril insurance. Currently, the Company&#146;s policies continue to exclude classic environmental contamination claims. In some states the Company is required, however, depending on the circumstances, to provide coverage for certain bodily injury claims, such as an individual&#146;s exposure to a release of chemicals. The Company has also issued policies that were intended to provide limited pollution and environmental coverage. These policies were specific to certain types of products underwritten by the Company. The Company has also received a number of asbestos- 

&#160; 

related claims, the majority of which are declined based on well-established exclusions. In establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to A&#38;E exposures, management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigations. Estimates of these liabilities are reviewed and updated continually. 

Uncertainty remains as to the Company&#146;s ultimate liability for asbestos-related claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims, the increase in the volume of claims made by plaintiffs who claim exposure but who have no symptoms of asbestos-related disease, and an increase in claims subject to coverage under general liability policies that do not contain aggregate limits of liability. 

The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, inclusive of A&#38;E reserves, reflects the Company&#146;s best estimates for future amounts needed to pay losses and related adjustment expenses as of each of the balance sheet dates reflected in the financial statements herein in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $15.8 million of net loss reserves for asbestos-related claims and $14.7 million for environmental claims. The Company attempts to estimate the full impact of the A&#38;E exposures by establishing specific case reserves on all known losses. See Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for tables showing the Company&#146;s gross and net reserves for A&#38;E losses. 

In addition to the factors referenced above, establishing reserves for A&#38;E and other mass tort claims involves considerably more judgment than other types of claims due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. 

In 2009, one of the Company&#146;s insurance companies entered into a settlement agreement to resolve asbestos related coverage litigation related to approximately 3,900 existing asbestos-related bodily injury claims and future claims. The settlement was approved by the Court and a final order was issued in September 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has no outstanding obligations as it relates to this settlement agreement. 

See Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for the survival ratios on a gross and net basis for the Company&#146;s open A&#38;E claims. 

Investments 

The Company&#146;s investment policy is determined by the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company engages third-party investment advisors to oversee its investments and to make recommendations to the Investment Committee. The Company&#146;s investment policy allows it to invest in taxable and tax-exempt fixed income investments including corporate bonds as well as publicly traded and private equity investments. With respect to fixed income investments, the maximum exposure per issuer varies as a function of the credit quality of the security. The allocation between taxable and tax-exempt bonds is determined based on market conditions and tax considerations, including the applicability of the alternative minimum tax. The maximum allowable investment in equity securities under the Company&#146;s investment policy is 30% of the Company&#146;s GAAP equity, or $225.0 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,516.3 million of investments and cash and cash equivalent assets, including $142.9 million of equity and limited partnership investments plus a $0.2 million receivable for securities sold. 

Insurance company investments must comply with applicable statutory regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. These regulations permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state, and municipal obligations, corporate bonds and loans, and preferred and common equity securities.

(1) Includes collateralized mortgage obligations of $57,330, $49,322, and $63,322 for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. (2) Does not include net receivable for securities sold of $172, $60, and $723 for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Although the Company generally intends to hold fixed maturities to recovery and/or maturity, the Company regularly re-evaluates its position based upon market conditions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s fixed maturities, excluding the mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations, had a weighted average maturity of 3.9 years and a weighted average duration, excluding mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations and including cash and short-term investments, of 1.9 years. The Company&#146;s financial statements reflect a net unrealized loss on fixed maturities available for sale as of December 31, 2015 of $2.2 million on a pre-tax basis. 

The following table shows the average amount of fixed maturities, income earned on fixed maturities, and the book yield thereon, as well as unrealized gains for the periods indicated:

(1) Represents income earned by fixed maturities, gross of investment expenses and excluding realized gains and losses. The Company has sought to structure its portfolio to reduce the risk of default on collateralized commercial real estate obligations and asset-backed securities. Of the $159.1 million of mortgage-backed securities, $101.8 million is invested in U.S. agency paper and $57.3 million is invested in collateralized mortgage obligations, of 

&#160; 

which $56.6 million, or 98.8%, are rated AA+ or better. In addition, the Company holds $260.0 million in asset-backed securities, of which 85.0% are rated AA or better and $140.4 million in commercial mortgaged-backed securities, of which 98.0% are rated A- or better. The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company&#146;s asset-backed securities is 23.4. The Company also faces liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is when the fair value of an investment is not able to be realized due to lack of interest by outside parties in the marketplace. The Company attempts to diversify its investment holdings to minimize this risk. The Company&#146;s investment managers run periodic analysis of liquidity costs to the fixed income portfolio. The Company also faces credit risk. 97.4% of the Company&#146;s fixed income securities are investment grade securities. 17.0% of the Company&#146;s fixed maturities are rated AAA. See &#147;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#148; in Item 7A of Part II of this report for a more detailed discussion of the credit market and the Company&#146;s investment strategy.

&#160;

&#160; The expected weighted average duration of the Company&#146;s asset-backed, mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities is 1.6 years. 

The value of the Company&#146;s portfolio of bonds is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates. In addition, some of the Company&#146;s bonds have call or prepayment options. This could subject the Company to 

&#160; 

reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities and the Company is forced to invest the proceeds at lower interest rates. The Company seeks to mitigate its reinvestment risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates, so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature, be called, or be prepaid at any point in time. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has aggregate equity securities of $110.3 million that consisted entirely of common stocks. 

The Company&#146;s investments in other invested assets is comprised of a limited liability partnership investment where the partnership invests in distressed securities and assets, which was valued at $32.6 million at December 31, 2015, and a limited liability partnership investment that invests in real estate, which was valued at zero at December 31, 2015. There is no readily available independent market price for these limited liability partnership investments. The Company does not have access to daily valuations, therefore the estimated fair value of these limited partnerships is based on the net asset value as a practical expedient for each limited partnership. The Company receives annual audited financial statements from each of the partnership investments it owns. 

Realized losses, including other than temporary impairments, for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.4 million compared with gains of $35.9 million and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Competition 

The Company competes with numerous domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, diversified financial services companies, Lloyd&#146;s syndicates, risk retention groups, insurance buying groups, risk securitization products and alternative self-insurance mechanisms. In particular, the Company competes against insurance subsidiaries of the groups in the specialty insurance market noted below, insurance companies, and others, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; American International Group; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; American Modern Insurance Group

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Travelers Companies, Inc.; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Validus Group; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; W.R. Berkley Corporation. 

&#160; 

In addition to the companies mentioned above, the Company is facing competition from standard line companies who are continuing to write risks that traditionally had been written by excess and surplus lines carriers, Bermuda companies who are establishing relationships with wholesale brokers and purchasing carriers, and other excess and surplus lines competitors. 

Competition may take the form of lower prices, broader coverage, greater product flexibility, higher quality services, reputation and financial strength or higher ratings by independent rating agencies. In all of the Company&#146;s markets, it competes by developing insurance products to satisfy well-defined market needs and by maintaining relationships with brokers and insureds that rely on the Company&#146;s expertise. For its program and specialty wholesale products, offerings and underwriting products that are not readily available is the Company&#146;s principal means of differentiating itself from its competition. Each of the Company&#146;s products has its own distinct competitive environment. The Company seeks to compete through innovative products, appropriate pricing, niche underwriting expertise, and quality service to policyholders, general agencies and brokers. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 460 employees. None of the Company&#146;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2015. 

Ratings 

A.M. Best ratings for the industry range from &#147;A++&#148; (Superior) to &#147;F&#148; (In Liquidation) with some companies not being rated. The Company&#146;s Insurance Operations, which consist of its United States based insurance companies, and Global Indemnity Reinsurance are currently rated &#147;A&#148; (Excellent) by A.M. Best, the third highest of sixteen rating categories. 

Publications of A.M. Best indicate that &#147;A&#148; (Excellent) ratings are assigned to those companies that, in A.M. Best&#146;s opinion, have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. In evaluating a company&#146;s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its spread of risk, the quality and appropriateness of its reinsurance, the quality and diversification of its assets, the adequacy of its policy and loss reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure and the experience and objectives of its management. These ratings are based on factors relevant to policyholders, general agencies, insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not directed to the protection of investors. 

Regulation 

General 

The business of insurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. As a holding company, Global Indemnity is not subject to any insurance regulation in the Republic of Ireland. However, Global Indemnity is subject to various Irish laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations governing interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors. 

U.S. Regulation 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had seven operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States; United National Insurance Company, Penn-America Insurance Company, and Penn-Star Insurance Company, which are domiciled in Pennsylvania; Diamond State Insurance Company which is domiciled in Indiana; United National Specialty Insurance Company, which is domiciled in Wisconsin; Penn-Patriot Insurance Company, which is domiciled in Virginia; and American Reliable Insurance Company, which is domiciled in Arizona. 

&#160; 

As the indirect parent of these U.S. insurance companies, Global Indemnity is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Arizona. These laws generally require each of the U.S. insurance companies to register with its respective domestic state insurance department and to annually furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the insurance holding company system. Generally, all material transactions among affiliated companies in the holding company system to which any of the U.S. insurance companies is a party must be fair, and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or absence of disapproval by the insurance department where the subsidiary is domiciled. Material transactions include sales, loans, reinsurance agreements, certain types of dividends, and service agreements with the non-insurance companies within Global Indemnity&#146;s family of companies, the Insurance Operations, or the Reinsurance Operations. 

Changes of Control 

Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider factors such as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant&#146;s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer&#146;s plans for the management, Board of Directors and executive officers of the company being acquired, the acquirer&#146;s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring 10% or more of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of the U.S. insurance companies, the insurance change of control laws of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Virginia and Arizona would likely apply to such a transaction. While the Company&#146;s articles of association limit the voting power of any U.S. shareholder to less than 9.5%, there can be no assurance that the applicable state insurance regulator would agree that any shareholder did not control the applicable insurance company. 

These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Global Indemnity, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of the shareholders of Global Indemnity might consider desirable. 

Federal Insurance Regulation 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) includes a number of provisions having a direct impact on the insurance industry, most notably, the creation of a Federal Insurance Office to monitor the insurance industry, streamlining of surplus lines insurance, credit for reinsurance, and systemic risk regulation. The Federal Insurance Office is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the U.S. Congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the United States. With respect to surplus lines insurance, the Dodd-Frank Act gives exclusive authority to regulate surplus lines transactions to the home state of the insured, and the requirement that a surplus lines broker must first attempt to place coverage in the admitted market is substantially softened with respect to large commercial policyholders. Significantly, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that a state may not prevent a surplus lines broker from placing surplus lines insurance with a non-U.S. insurer that appears on the quarterly listing of non-admitted insurers maintained by the International Insurers Department of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#147;NAIC&#148;). Regarding credit for reinsurance, the Dodd-Frank Act generally provides that the state of domicile of the ceding company (and no other state) may regulate financial statement credit for the ceded risk. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides the U.S. Federal Reserve with supervisory authority over insurance companies that are deemed to be &#147;systemically important.&#148; Regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act continue to be developed and the Company continues to monitor the impact the Dodd-Frank Act may have on operations. 

&#160; 

State Insurance Regulation 

State insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of U.S. insurance companies, including, but not limited to, licensing companies to transact admitted business or determining eligibility to write surplus lines business, accreditation of reinsurers, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, management of enterprise risk, regulating investments and dividends, approving policy forms and related materials in certain instances and approving premium rates in certain instances. State insurance laws and regulations may require the Company&#146;s U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere they will be licensed or eligible or accredited to conduct insurance business, and their operations are subject to review by those departments at any time. The Company&#146;s U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles (&#147;SAP&#148;) and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years, although market conduct examinations may take place at any time. These examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. In addition, admitted insurers are subject to targeted market conduct examinations involving specific insurers by state insurance regulators in any state in which the insurer is admitted. The insurance departments for the states of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Virginia completed their most recent financial examinations of the Company&#146;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Reliable, for the period ended December 31, 2012. Their final reports were issued in 2014, and there were no materially adverse findings. The insurance department for the state of Arizona completed its most recent financial examination of American Reliable for the period ending December 31, 2013. Their final report was issued in 2015, and there were no materially adverse findings. 

Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios 

The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System (&#147;IRIS&#148;) was developed by a committee of the state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies twelve industry ratios and specifies &#147;usual values&#148; for each ratio. Departure from the usual values of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer&#146;s business. Insurers that report four or more ratios that fall outside the range of usual values are generally targeted for increased regulatory review. 

The Company&#146;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries have acceptable results for the IRIS ratios with the exception of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Change in policyholder&#146;s surplus and adjusted liabilities of United National Insurance Company were outside of the IRIS range primarily due to ordinary dividend to its parent, Global Indemnity Group, Inc. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Investment yields were lower than the IRIS range for Diamond State Insurance Company, United National Specialty Insurance Company, Penn-Star Insurance Company and Penn-Patriot Insurance Company. The investment portfolios of these companies are invested in high quality short duration bonds. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The following ratios were outside of the IRIS range due to the acquisition of American Reliable Insurance Company on January 1, 2015 and the addition of American Reliable Insurance Company to the intercompany pooling arrangements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Changes in net written premiums for American Reliable Insurance Company, United National Insurance Company, Diamond State Insurance Company, United National Specialty Insurance Company, Penn-Star Insurance Company and Penn-Patriot Insurance Company 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Asset to liability liquidity ratios for United National Insurance Company, Penn-America Insurance Company and American Reliable Insurance Company 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Estimated current reserve deficiency for United National Insurance Company, Diamond State Insurance Company, United National Specialty Insurance Company, Penn-America Insurance Company and Penn-Star Insurance Company 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Two-year overall operating ratio for Penn-Patriot Insurance Company and American Reliable Insurance Company 

Risk-Based Capital Regulations 

The state insurance departments of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Virginia and Arizona require that each domestic insurer report its risk-based capital based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. The respective state insurance regulators use the formula as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and generally not as a means to rank insurers. State insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business (including insurers, general agencies, brokers and others) and on state insurance departments as to the use and publication of risk-based capital data. The respective state insurance regulators have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by, or to take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain company action level risk-based capital levels. 

Based on the standards currently adopted, the U.S. insurance companies reported in their 2015 statutory filings that their capital and surplus are above the prescribed company action level risk-based capital requirements. See Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information on the NAIC&#146;s risk-based capital model for determining the levels of statutory capital and surplus an insurer must maintain. 

Statutory Accounting Principles 

SAP is a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer&#146;s surplus. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance laws, regulatory provisions, and practices prescribed or permitted by each insurer&#146;s domiciliary state. 

GAAP is concerned with a company&#146;s solvency, but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. As a direct result, different line item groupings of assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities are reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP than financial statements prepared in accordance with SAP. 

Statutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted in part by the Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Arizona regulators determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of the U.S. insurance companies and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds these subsidiaries have available to pay dividends. 

State Dividend Limitations 

The U.S. insurance companies are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of the applicable state regulatory authorities. Dividends may be paid without advanced regulatory approval only out of unassigned surplus. The dividend limitations imposed by the applicable state laws are based on the statutory financial results of each company within the Insurance Operations that are determined using statutory accounting practices that differ in various respects from accounting principles used in 

&#160; 

financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. See &#147;Regulation &#150; Statutory Accounting Principles.&#148; Key differences relate to, among other items, deferred acquisition costs, limitations on deferred income taxes, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes, if any. 

See the &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; section in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a more complete description of the state dividend limitations. See Note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for the dividends declared and paid by Global Indemnity&#146;s U.S. insurance companies in 2015 and the maximum amount of distributions that U.S. insurance companies could pay as dividends in 2016. 

Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements 

Most of the jurisdictions in which the U.S. insurance companies are admitted to transact business require property and casualty insurers doing business within that jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations. These associations are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent, or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or in limited circumstances by surcharging policyholders. 

Operations of Global Indemnity Reinsurance 

The insurance laws of the United States regulate or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non-domestic insurers and reinsurers that are not admitted to do business within such jurisdictions. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is not admitted to do business in the United States. The Company does not intend for Global Indemnity Reinsurance to maintain offices or solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other insurance and reinsurance underwriting activities in any jurisdiction in the United States where the conduct of such activities would require that Global Indemnity Reinsurance be admitted or authorized. 

As a reinsurer that is not licensed, accredited, or approved in any state in the United States, Global Indemnity Reinsurance is required to post collateral security with respect to the reinsurance liabilities it assumes from the Company&#146;s Insurance Operations as well as other U.S. ceding companies. The posting of collateral security is generally required in order for U.S. ceding companies to obtain credit on their U.S. statutory financial statements with respect to reinsurance liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers. Under applicable United States &#147;credit for reinsurance&#148; statutory provisions, the security arrangements generally may be in the form of letters of credit, reinsurance trusts maintained by third-party trustees or funds-withheld arrangements whereby the ceded premium is held by the ceding company. If &#147;credit for reinsurance&#148; laws or regulations are made more stringent in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Virginia and Arizona or other applicable states or any of the U.S. insurance companies re-domesticate to one of the few states that do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non-licensed reinsurers, the Company may be unable to realize some of the benefits expected from its business plan. Accordingly, Global Indemnity Reinsurance could be adversely affected. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance generally is not subject to regulation by U.S. jurisdictions. Specifically, rate and form regulations otherwise applicable to authorized insurers generally do not apply to Global Indemnity Reinsurance&#146;s surplus lines transactions. 

Bermuda Insurance Regulation 

The Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations, as amended (the &#147;Insurance Act&#148;), regulates the insurance business of Global Indemnity Reinsurance and provides that no person may carry on any such business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the &#147;BMA&#148;) 

&#160; 

under the Insurance Act. Global Indemnity Reinsurance, which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business, is registered as a Class 3B insurer in Bermuda. A corporate body is registrable as a Class 3B insurer if it intends to carry on insurance business in circumstances where 50% or more of the net premiums written or 50% or more of the loss and loss expense provisions represent unrelated business, or its total net premiums written from unrelated business are $50.0 million or more. The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to it complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. An insurer&#146;s registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act, including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act. 

The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards, auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, require information and the production of documents, and to intervene in the affairs of Bermuda insurance companies. The BMA continues to make amendments to the Insurance Act with a view to enhancing Bermuda&#146;s insurance regulatory regime. 

The BMA utilizes a risk-based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance companies. As part of the BMA&#146;s risk-based system, an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer is used to determine the limitations and specific requirements which may be imposed. Thereafter the BMA keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis, including through the scrutiny of regular audited statutory financial statements, and, as appropriate, meeting with senior management during onsite visits. 

Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth as follows: 

Cancellation of Insurer&#146;s Registration 

An insurer&#146;s registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Bermuda Insurance Act, including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Bermuda Insurance Act or if, in the opinion of the BMA, the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles. 

Principal Representative and Principal Office 

Every registered insurer or reinsurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda, subject to certain prescribed requirements under the Bermuda Insurance Act. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class 3A insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda. The recent amendments to the Bermuda Insurance Act provide that in considering whether an insurer satisfies the requirements of having its head office in Bermuda, the BMA may consider (a) where the underwriting, risk management, and operational decision making occurs; (b) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making are located in Bermuda; and (c) where meetings of the board of directors occur. The BMA will also consider (a) the location where management meets to effect policy decisions; (b) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees; and (c) the residence of one or more directors in Bermuda. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance maintains its principal office in Hamilton, Bermuda and its external management firm has been appointed as its principal representative. 

It is the duty of the principal representative upon reaching the view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which the principal representative acts becoming insolvent or that a reportable &#147;event&#148; has, to the principal representative&#146;s knowledge, occurred or is believed to have occurred, to immediately notify the BMA and to make a report in writing to the BMA within 14 days of the prior notification setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative. 

&#160; 

Where there has been a significant loss which is reasonably likely to cause the insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (in respect of its general business, as described below under the Enhanced Capital Requirement (&#147;ECR&#148;) and Minimum Solvency Margin (&#147;MSM&#148;) section), the principal representative must also furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. The principal representative must provide this within 45 days of notifying the BMA regarding the loss. 

Furthermore, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change to an insurer&#146;s business or structure (including a merger or amalgamation), the principal representative has 30 days from the date of such notification to furnish the BMA with unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period if so requested by the BMA, together with a general business solvency certificate in respect to those statements. 

Independent Approved Auditor 

Every registered insurer, such as Global Indemnity Reinsurance, must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer, both of which are required to be filed annually with the BMA. 

Loss Reserve Specialist 

As a registered Class 3B insurer, Global Indemnity Reinsurance is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist in respect of its losses and loss expense provisions with its statutory financial return. 

Statutory Financial Statements 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance must prepare annual statutory financial statements in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978. These statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP or SAP. The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto). 

Annual Statutory Financial Return 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance is required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end (unless specifically extended upon application to the BMA). The statutory financial return for a Class 3B insurer includes, among other matters, a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer, solvency certificates, schedules of ceded reinsurance, the statutory financial statements, a declaration of statutory ratios and the opinion of the loss reserve specialist. Pursuant to the Bermuda Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and 3B Solvency Requirement) rules 2008, Global Indemnity Reinsurance is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance, and investments and is also required to provide audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. 

Enhanced Capital Requirement (&#147;ECR&#148;) and Minimum Solvency Margin (&#147;MSM&#148;) 

The BMA has promulgated the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and Class 3B Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2008, as amended (the &#147;Rules&#148;) which, among other things, mandate that a Class 3B insurer&#146;s ECR be calculated by either (a) the model set out in Schedule I to the Rules, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. These measures are an integral part of the BMA&#146;s ongoing Solvency II equivalence program for Class 3B insurance companies. For 2015, Global Indemnity Reinsurance used the BMA&#146;s model to calculate its capital and solvency requirements. 

&#160; 

The risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency requirements implemented with effect from December 31, 2008 (termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement or &#147;BSCR&#148;) provide a risk-based capital model as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business. The framework that has been developed applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer&#146;s assets, liabilities and premiums, including a formula to take account of catastrophe risk exposure. 

Where an insurer believes that its own internal model for measuring risk and determining appropriate levels of capital better reflects the inherent risk of its business, it may apply to the BMA for approval to use its internal capital model in substitution for the BSCR model. The BMA may approve an insurer&#146;s internal model, provided certain conditions have been established, and may revoke approval of an internal model in the event that the conditions are no longer met or where it feels that the revocation is appropriate. The BMA will review the internal model regularly to confirm that the model continues to meet the conditions. 

In order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation, the BMA seeks that insurers operate at or above a threshold capital level (termed the Target Capital Level or &#147;TCL&#148;), which exceeds the BSCR or approved internal model minimum amounts. The Rules provide prudential standards in relation to the ECR and Capital and Solvency Return (&#147;CSR&#148;). The ECR is determined using the BSCR or an approved internal model, provided that at all times the ECR must be an amount equal to, or exceeding the MSM. The CSR is the return setting out the insurer&#146;s risk management practices and other information used by the insurer to calculate its approved internal model ECR. The capital requirements require Class 3B insurers to hold available statutory capital and surplus equal to, or exceeding ECR and set TCL at 120% of ECR. In circumstances where an insurer has failed to comply with an ECR given by the BMA, such insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends until the failure is rectified. 

The risk-based solvency capital framework referred to above represents a modification of the minimum solvency margin test set out in the Insurance Returns and Solvency Amendment Regulations 1980 (as amended). While it must calculate its ECR annually by reference to either the BSCR or an approved internal model, Global Indemnity Reinsurance must also ensure at all times that its ECR is at least equal to the MSM for a Class 3B insurer in respect of its general business, which is the greater of: 

&#160;

(i) $1.0 million; &#160;

(ii) 50% of net premiums written; &#160;

(iii) 15% of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and other general business insurance reserves. &#160;

(iv) 25% of the insurer&#146;s enhanced capital requirement. The BMA has also introduced a three-tiered capital system for Class 3B insurers designed to assess the quality of capital resources that an insurer has available to meet its capital requirements. The tiered capital system classifies all capital instruments into one of three tiers based on their &#147;loss absorbency&#148; characteristics, with the highest quality capital classified as Tier 1 Capital and lesser quality capital classified as either Tier 2 or Tier 3 Capital. Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital may be used to support an insurer&#146;s MSM. Certain percentages of each of Tier 1, 2 and 3 Capital may be used to satisfy an insurer&#146;s ECR. Any combination of Tier 1, 2 or 3 Capital may be used to meet the TCL. 

The Rules introduced a regime that requires Class 3B insurers to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer&#146;s Solvency Self Assessment (&#147;CISSA&#148;). The CISSA will allow the BMA to obtain an insurer&#146;s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess the company&#146;s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. The Rules also introduced a Catastrophe Risk Return, which must be filed with the BMA, which assesses an insurer&#146;s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure. 

&#160; 

Economic Balance Sheet Framework 

The Economic Balance Sheet (&#147;EBS&#148;) framework is an accounting balance sheet approach using market consistent values for all current assets and current obligations relating to in-force business which applies to Class 3B and 4 insurers effective for the 2016 financial year end. The EBS framework is embedded as part of the Capital and Solvency Return and forms the basis for the insurer&#146;s ECR. There is a mandatory trial run of the EBS for all insurers and insurance groups for the 2015 year end and the EBS will be in full effect as of 2016 year end. 

Minimum Liquidity Ratio 

The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers, such as Global Indemnity Reinsurance. An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities; as such terms are defined in the Insurance Act. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it to fail to meet such margin or ratio. In addition, if it has failed to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, Global Indemnity Reinsurance will be prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance is prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year&#146;s financial statements, and any application for such approval must include such information as the BMA may require. In addition, if at any time it fails to meet its minimum margin of solvency, Global Indemnity Reinsurance is required within 30 days after becoming aware of such failure or having reason to believe that such failure has occurred, to file with the BMA a written report containing certain information. 

Additionally, under the Companies Act, Global Indemnity Reinsurance may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution from contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. 

Supervision, Investigation and Intervention 

The BMA has wide powers of investigation and document production in relation to Bermuda insurers under the Insurance Act. For example, the BMA may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of Global Indemnity Reinsurance if the BMA believes that such an investigation is in the best interests of its policyholders or persons who may become policyholders. Further, the BMA has the power to appoint a professional person to prepare a report on any aspect of any matter about which the BMA has or could require information. If it appears to the BMA that there is a risk of Global Indemnity Reinsurance becoming insolvent, or that Global Indemnity Reinsurance is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, the BMA may, among other things, direct Global Indemnity Reinsurance not to take on any new business, not to vary any current treaties if the effect would be to increase its liabilities, not to make certain investments, to realize or not realize certain investments, to maintain in, or transfer to, the custody of a specified bank, certain assets, not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments, or to limit its premium income or remove an officer. 

The BMA may also make additional rules prescribing prudential standards in relation to ECR, CSR&#146;s, insurance reserves and eligible capital which Global Indemnity Reinsurance must comply with. 

&#160; 

Bermuda Code of Conduct 

The BMA has implemented the Insurance Code of Conduct (the &#147;Bermuda Code of Conduct&#148;) which came into effect on July 1, 2010. The BMA established July 1, 2011 as the date of compliance for commercial insurers. The Bermuda Code of Conduct is divided into six categories: (i) Proportionality Principal, (ii) Corporate Governance, (iii) Risk Management, (iv) Governance Mechanism, (v) Outsourcing, and (vi) Market Discipline and Disclosure. These categories contain the duties, requirements and compliance standards to which all insurers must adhere. It stipulates that in order to achieve compliance with the Bermuda Code of Conduct, insurers are to develop and apply policies and procedures capable of assessment by the BMA. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is in compliance with the Bermuda Code of Conduct. 

Group Supervision 

Emerging international norms in the regulation of global insurance groups are trending increasingly towards the imposition of group-wide supervisory regimes by one principal &#147;home&#148; regulator over all the legal entities in the group, no matter where incorporated. Amendments to the Insurance Act in 2010 introduced such a regime into Bermuda insurance regulation. 

The Insurance Act contains provisions regarding group supervision, the authority to exclude specified entities from group supervision, the power for the BMA to withdraw as a group supervisor, the functions of the BMA as group supervisor and the power of the BMA to make rules regarding group supervision. 

The BMA has issued the Insurance (Group Supervision) Rules 2011 (the &#147;Group Supervision Rules&#148;) and the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Insurance Group Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 (the &#147;Group Solvency Rules&#148;) each effective December 31, 2011. The Group Supervision Rules set out the rules in respect of the assessment of the financial situation and solvency of an insurance group, the system of governance and risk management of the insurance group, and supervisory reporting and disclosures of the insurance group. The Group Solvency Rules set out the rules in respect of the capital and solvency return and enhanced capital requirements for an insurance group. The BMA also intends to publish an insurance code of conduct in relation to group supervision. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance was notified by the BMA that, having considered the matters set out in the 2010 amendments to the Insurance Act, it had determined that it would not be Global Indemnity Reinsurance&#146;s group supervisor. 

Notifications to the BMA 

In the event that the share capital of an insurer (or its parent) is traded on any stock exchange recognized by the BMA, then any shareholder must notify the BMA within 45 days of becoming a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder of such insurer. An insurer must also provide written notice to the BMA that a person has become, or ceased to be, a &#147;Controller&#148; of that insurer. A Controller for this purpose means a managing director, chief executive or other person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Directors of Global Indemnity Reinsurance are accustomed to act, including any person who holds, or is entitled to exercise, 10% or more of the voting shares or voting power or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence over the management of Global Indemnity Reinsurance. 

Global Indemnity Reinsurance is also required to notify the BMA in writing in the event any person has become or ceased to be an officer of it, an officer being a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters. Failure to give required notice is an offense under the Insurance Act. 

&#160; 

An insurer, or designated insurer in respect of the group of which it is a member, must notify the BMA in writing that it proposes to take measures that are likely to be of material significance for the discharge, in relation to the insurer or the group, of the BMA&#146;s functions under the Insurance Act. Measures that are likely to be of material significance include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquisition or transfer of insurance business being part of a scheme falling within section 25 of the Insurance Act or section 99 of the Companies Act; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a material change in the insurer&#146;s business plan not otherwise reported to the BMA. 

In respect of the forgoing, the BMA will typically object to the material change unless it is satisfied that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the interest of the policyholders and potential policyholders of the insurer or the group would not in any manner be threatened by the material change; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; without prejudice to the first point, that, having regard to the material change, the requirements of the Insurance Act would continue to be complied with, or, if any of those requirements are not complied with, that the insurer concerned is likely to undertake adequate remedial action. 

Failure to give such notice constitutes an offence under the Insurance Act. It is possible to appeal a notice of objection served by the BMA. 

Disclosure of Information 

The BMA may assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda, but subject to restrictions. For example, the BMA must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority. Further, the BMA must consider whether cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Insurance Act provides sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality. 

Under the Companies Act, the Minister of Finance may assist a foreign regulatory authority that has requested assistance in connection with inquiries being carried out by it in the performance of its regulatory functions. The Minster of Finance&#146;s powers include requiring a person to furnish information to the Minister of Finance, to produce documents to the Minister of Finance, to attend and answer questions and to give assistance to the Minister of Finance in relation to inquiries. The Minister of Finance must be satisfied that the assistance requested by the foreign regulatory authority is for the purpose of its regulatory functions and that the request is in relation to information in Bermuda that a person has in his possession or under his control. The Minister of Finance must consider, among other things, whether it is in the public interest to give the information sought. 

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations 

Although Global Indemnity Reinsurance is incorporated in Bermuda, it is classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to the non-resident status, Global Indemnity Reinsurance may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars, and there are no restrictions on its ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents that are holders of its ordinary shares. 

Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an &#147;exempted&#148; company, Global Indemnity Reinsurance may not, without the express authorization of the Bermuda legislature or under a license or consent granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind for which it is not licensed in Bermuda. 

&#160; 

Taxation of Global Indemnity and Subsidiaries 

Ireland 

Global Indemnity is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Ireland. The Company is a resident taxpayer fully subject to Ireland corporate income tax of 12.5% on trading income and 25.0% on non-trading income, including interest and dividends from foreign companies.

Global Indemnity Services Ltd., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Ireland. The company is a resident taxpayer fully subject to Ireland corporate income tax laws. Currently, Global Indemnity Services Ltd. has only trading income, so it is subject to corporate income tax of 12.5%. 

U.A.I. (Ireland) Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, is a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Ireland. The company is a resident taxpayer fully subject to Ireland corporate income tax laws. Currently, U.A.I. (Ireland) Limited has only non-trading income, so it is subject to corporate income tax of 25.0%.

Cayman Islands 

United America Indemnity, Ltd., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary, and Global Indemnity (Cayman) Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, are private limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Under current Cayman Islands law, the Company is not required to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on its income or capital gains. United America Indemnity, Ltd. obtained an undertaking on September 2, 2003 from the Governor in Council of the Cayman Islands substantially that, for a period of 20 years from the date of such undertaking, no law that is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profit or income or gains or appreciation shall apply to it and no such tax and no tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable, either directly or by way of withholding, on its shares. Given the limited duration of the undertaking, the Company cannot be certain that it will not be subject to Cayman Islands tax after the expiration of the 20 year period. 

Bermuda 

Under current Bermuda law, the Company and its Bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay any taxes in Bermuda on income or capital gains. Currently, there is no Bermuda income, corporation or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by Global Indemnity Reinsurance or its shareholders, other than shareholders ordinarily resident in Bermuda, if any. Currently, there is no Bermuda withholding or other tax on principal, interest, or dividends paid to holders of the ordinary shares of Global Indemnity Reinsurance, other than holders ordinarily resident in Bermuda, if any. There can be no assurance that Global Indemnity Reinsurance or its shareholders will not be subject to any such tax in the future.

The Company has received a written assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966 of Bermuda, that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to Global Indemnity Reinsurance or to any of its operations, shares, debentures or obligations through March 31, 2035; provided that such assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in Bermuda, or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by Global Indemnity Reinsurance in respect of real property or leasehold interests in Bermuda held by them. Given the limited duration of the assurance, the Company cannot be certain that the Company will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 31, 2035.

Luxembourg 

U.A.I. (Luxembourg) I S.&#224;.r.l., U.A.I. (Luxembourg) II S.&#224;.r.l., U.A.I. (Luxembourg) III S.&#224;.r.l., U.A.I. (Luxembourg) IV S.&#224;.r.l., U.A.I. (Luxembourg) Investment S.&#224;.r.l., Wind River (Luxembourg) S.&#224;.r.l., and Global Indemnity (Luxembourg) S.&#224;.r.l. (the &#147;Luxembourg Companies&#148;) are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries and private limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. These are taxable companies, which may carry out any activities that fall within the scope of their corporate object clause. In accordance with Luxembourg regulations, the companies are resident taxpayers fully subject to Luxembourg corporate income tax at a rate of 29.22% and net worth tax at a rate of 0.5%. The companies are entitled to benefits of the tax treaties concluded between Luxembourg and other countries and European Union Directives. 

Profit distributions (not in respect to liquidations) by the companies are generally subject to Luxembourg dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15%, unless a domestic law exemption or a lower tax treaty rate applies. Dividends paid by any of the Luxembourg Companies to their Luxembourg resident parent company are exempt from Luxembourg dividend withholding tax, provided that at the time of the dividend distribution, the resident parent company has held (or commits itself to continue to hold) 10% or more of the nominal paid up capital of the distributing entity or, in the event of a lower percentage participation, a participation having an acquisition price of Euro 1.2 million or more for a period of at least 12 months. 

The Luxembourg Companies have received advance tax confirmations (&#147;ATCs&#148;) from the Luxembourg Administration des Contributions Directes (the &#147;Luxembourg tax authorities&#148;) that the financing activities of the Luxembourg Companies does not lead to taxation in Luxembourg except for the taxation as provided in the ATCs. Based on these confirmations, the current financing activities of the Luxembourg Companies should not lead to taxation in Luxembourg other than for such tax as provided for in the financial statements. The Luxembourg Companies have in their files transfer pricing documentation substantiating the arm&#146;s length nature of the financing activities. It is however not guaranteed that the Luxembourg Companies cannot be subject to higher Luxembourg taxes.

United States 

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Company&#146;s operations. The Company manages its business in a manner that seeks to mitigate the risk that either Global Indemnity or Global Indemnity Reinsurance will be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, whether business is being conducted in the United States is an inherently factual determination. Because the United States Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;), regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the United States, the Company cannot be certain that the IRS will not contend successfully that Global Indemnity or Global Indemnity Reinsurance is or has been engaged in a trade or business in the United States. A non-U.S. corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. income tax at regular corporate rates, as well as the branch profits tax, on its income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty, as discussed below. Such income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a U.S. corporation, except that a non-U.S. corporation is generally entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a U.S. federal income tax return. Global Indemnity and Global Indemnity Reinsurance are filing protective U.S. federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that it is subject to U.S. federal income tax. All of the Company&#146;s other non-U.S. entities are considered disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes. The highest marginal federal income tax rates as of 2015 are 39.6% for a corporation&#146;s effectively connected income and 30% for the branch profits tax. 

If Global Indemnity Reinsurance is entitled to the benefits under the tax treaty between Bermuda and the United States (the &#147;Bermuda Treaty&#148;), Global Indemnity Reinsurance would not be subject to U.S. income tax on any business profits of its insurance enterprise found to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the United States. No regulations interpreting the Bermuda Treaty have been issued. Global Indemnity Reinsurance currently conducts its activities to reduce the risk that it will have a permanent establishment in the United States, although the Company cannot be certain that it will achieve this result. 

An insurance enterprise resident in Bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty if (1) more than 50% of its shares are owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, by individual residents of the United States or Bermuda or U.S. citizens and (2) its income is not used in substantial part, directly or indirectly, to make disproportionate distributions to, or to meet certain liabilities to, persons who are neither residents of either the United States or Bermuda nor U.S. citizens. The Company cannot be certain that Global Indemnity Reinsurance will be eligible for Bermuda Treaty benefits in the future because of factual and legal uncertainties regarding the residency and citizenship of the Company&#146;s shareholders. 

Foreign insurance companies carrying on an insurance business within the United States have a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income, determined in accordance with a formula that depends, in part, on the amount of U.S. risk insured or reinsured by such companies. If Global Indemnity Reinsurance is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the United States and it is not entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty in general (because it fails to qualify under the limitations on treaty benefits discussed above), the Code could subject a significant portion of Global Indemnity Reinsurance&#146;s investment income to U.S. income tax. In addition, while the Bermuda Treaty clearly applies to premium income, it is uncertain whether the Bermuda Treaty applies to other income such as investment income. If Global Indemnity 

&#160; 

Reinsurance is considered engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the United States and is entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty in general, but the Bermuda Treaty is interpreted to not apply to investment income, a significant portion of Global Indemnity Reinsurance&#146;s investment income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax. 

The United States also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the United States. The rates of tax applicable to premiums paid to Global Indemnity Reinsurance on such business are 4% for direct insurance premiums and 1% for reinsurance premiums. Foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the United States are subject to 30% U.S. income tax imposed by withholding on the gross amount of certain &#147;fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits and income&#148; derived from sources within the United States (such as dividends and certain interest on investments), subject to exemption under the Code or reduction by applicable treaties. The Bermuda Treaty does not reduce the rate of tax in such circumstances. Global Indemnity Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation wholly owned by U.A.I. (Luxembourg) Investment S.&#224;.r.l. Under U.S. federal income tax law, dividends and interest paid by a U.S. corporation to a non-U.S. shareholder are generally subject to a 30% withholding tax, unless reduced by treaty. The income tax treaty between Luxembourg and the United States (the &#147;Luxembourg Treaty&#148;) reduces the rate of withholding tax on interest payments to 0% and on dividends to 15%, or 5% (if the shareholder owns 10% or more of the company&#146;s voting stock). There is a risk that interest paid by the Company&#146;s U.S. subsidiary to a Luxembourg affiliate may be subject to a 30% withholding tax. 

The Company&#146;s U.S. subsidiaries are each subject to taxation in the United States at regular corporate rates.
