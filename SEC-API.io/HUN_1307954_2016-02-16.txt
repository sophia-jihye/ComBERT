 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

We are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. Our Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the businesses of Huntsman Holdings, LLC, a company founded by Jon M. Huntsman. Mr. Huntsman founded the predecessor to our Company in 1970 as a small polystyrene plastics packaging company. Since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 

We operate all of our businesses through Huntsman International, our 100% owned subsidiary. Huntsman International is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 10003 Woodloch Forest Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719-6000. 

OVERVIEW 

We operate in five segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials, Textile Effects and Pigments and Additives. Our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. Our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including MDI, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. Our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "&#151;Item 2. Properties" below, which are located in 30 countries. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,000 associates worldwide. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $10,299 million, $11,578 million and $11,079 million, respectively. 

Our Products 

We produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. Our Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials and Textile Effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our Pigments and Additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. 

Growth in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. Accordingly, the profitability of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the 

petrochemical industry. Titanium dioxide, within our Pigments and Additives segment, is cyclical and influenced by seasonal demand patterns in the coatings industry.

Polyurethanes 

General 

We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including MDI products, PO, polyols, PG and TPU (each discussed in more detail below under "&#151;Products and Markets"). Polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. We focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for MDI and MDI-based polyurethane systems. Growth in our Polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of MDI-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. We operate five primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. We also operate 19 strategically located polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as "systems houses," located in close proximity to our customers worldwide (see facilities listed in "&#151;Item 2. Properties" below), which enables us to focus on customer support and technical service. We also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing 

facility focused on the insulation market and three TPU manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. 

Our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as MDI, with polyols, which are derived largely from PO and EO. We are able to produce over 2,000 distinct MDI-based polyurethane products by modifying the MDI molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our MDI formulations. As a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from MDI, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, adhesives, wood binders, footwear and other specialized engineering applications. 

We are one of three North American producers of PO. We and some of our customers process PO into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, PG and various other chemical products. End uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings and cleaning products industries. We also produce MTBE as a co-product of our PO manufacturing process. MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. See "&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors." 

In 1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in China. We have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility. In January 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build MDI production and finishing facilities near Shanghai, China in Caojing. In June 2006, HPS, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our MDI finishing plant. In September 2006, SLIC, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the MNB, aniline and crude MDI plants. We intend to expand the capacity of these facilities by 2018. These world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical Chinese market and will support the long-term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. Additionally, in November 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale PO/MTBE plant in Nanjing, China. The facility is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, with start-up expected in the first half of 2017, and will utilize our proprietary PO/MTBE manufacturing technology. We own a 49% interest in the joint venture. 

Products and Markets 

MDI is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. Polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with MDI in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. PO is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. The following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. 

Polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. Depending on their needs, customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. By varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 

MDI. MDI has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane materials. This is primarily because MDI can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. We believe that future growth of MDI will be driven by the continued substitution of MDI-based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction. We expect that other markets, such as binders for reconstituted wood board products, specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of MDI. With the recent rapid growth of the developing Asian economies, Asian markets have now become the largest in the world for MDI. 

MDI experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. Sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

TPU. TPU is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of MDI or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. We can tailor the performance characteristics of TPU to meet the specific requirements of our customers. TPU is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. It is also extruded into films, wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets. 

Polyols. Polyols are combined with MDI and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products. Demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which MDI consumption has grown. 

Aniline. Aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture MDI. Generally, aniline is either consumed internally or is sold to third parties under long-term supply contracts. We believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, MDI manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 

PO. PO is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and PG. Demand for PO depends largely on overall economic demand, especially that of consumer durables. The following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for PO. 

MTBE. MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. While MTBE has been effectively eliminated in the United States, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. See "&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors." In 2011, we announced the signing of a license agreement with Chinese chemicals manufacturer Yantai Wanhua Polyurethanes Co., Ltd, for the production of PO and MTBE. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec to construct and operate a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. See "&#151;Manufacturing and Operations" below and "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Sales and Marketing 

Our global sales group markets our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in approximately 100 countries. Our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, which requires a global approach. These key end-use markets include the appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, construction products, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. 

We provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready-to-use form. Our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs is critical to our long-term success. We have strategically located our polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. We believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. We manufacture polyols primarily to support our MDI customers' requirements. 

We believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. Our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

Our MDI production facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and through our joint ventures in Caojing, China. These facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of MDI, from our facilities located in Geismar, Louisiana; Wilton, U.K.; and Caojing, China. We believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers. In addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials, integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices. 

The following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities: 

&#160; &#160; MDI &#160; Polyols &#160; TPU &#160; Aniline &#160; Nitrobenzene &#160; PO &#160; PG &#160; MTBE &#160; &#160; (millions of pounds) &#160; (millions of gallons) Caojing, China &#160; 330(1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Geismar, Louisiana &#160; 1,060 &#160; 160 &#160; &#160; &#160; 750(2) &#160; 1,000(2) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Houston, Texas &#160; &#160; &#160; 170 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Jinshan, China &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Osnabr&#252;ck, Germany &#160; &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; 59 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Port Neches, Texas &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 525 &#160; 145 &#160; 260 Ringwood, Illinois &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rotterdam, The Netherlands &#160; 880 &#160; 190 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Wilton, U.K. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 715 &#160; 953 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; 2,270 &#160; 546 &#160; 92 &#160; 1,465 &#160; 1,953 &#160; 525 &#160; 145 &#160; 260 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) Represents our 50% share of capacity from SLIC. (2) Represents our approximately 85% share of capacity under our consolidated Rubicon LLC manufacturing joint venture with Chemtura Corporation. 

At our Geismar, Rotterdam and Caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce MDI. This technology contributes to our position as a low cost MDI producer. In addition to MDI, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture PO. We own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our PO facility. Our process combines 

isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming TBHP and TBA, which are further processed into PO and MTBE, respectively. Because our PO production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows PO co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our PO production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives. 

Joint Ventures 

Rubicon Joint Venture. Chemtura Corporation is our joint venture partner in Rubicon LLC, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA manufacturing facilities in Geismar, Louisiana. We are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of Rubicon LLC, and Chemtura Corporation is entitled to 100% of the DPA production. In addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA facilities, Rubicon LLC operates our wholly-owned MDI, polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at Geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire Geismar complex. As a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. Rubicon LLC is consolidated in our financial statements. 

Chinese MDI Joint Ventures. We are involved in two related joint ventures which operate MDI production facilities in Caojing, China. SLIC, our manufacturing joint venture with BASF and three Chinese chemical companies, produces MNB, aniline and crude MDI. We effectively own 35% of SLIC and account for our investment under the equity method. HPS, our splitting joint venture with Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical Company, Ltd, manufactures pure MDI, polymeric MDI and MDI variants. We own 70% of HPS and it is consolidated in our financial statements. These projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. The total production capacity of the SLIC facilities is 660 million pounds per year of MDI and the splitting capacity of the HPS facility is 350 million pounds per year of MDI. 

Chinese PO/MTBE Joint Venture. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec. The joint venture involves the construction and operation of a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. Our total equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. At the end of 2015, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. Construction of the project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, with start-up expected in the first half of 2017. 

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials for MDI-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and PO. Benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of MDI and aniline. Historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. We purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce MDI. 

A major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of PO. The integration of our PO business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced, strategic source of PO and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of MDI products. The primary raw materials used in our PO production process are butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. We purchase a large portion of our raw materials under long-term contracts. 

Competition 

Our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include BASF, Covestro, Dow, Yantai Wanhua and LyondellBasell. While these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on MDI and MDI-based polyurethane systems. Our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs. 

Some of our competitors in the Polyurethanes segment are among the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies. These competitors may have their own raw material resources. Some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. If any of our current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. See "&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors." 

Performance Products 

General 

Our Performance Products segment has leading positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and serves a wide variety of global consumer and industrial end markets from production facilities located in North America; Europe, Africa and the Middle East ("EAME"); Asia; and Australia. 

We are a leading global producer of amines, carbonates, maleic anhydride and surfactants for sale into specialty markets such as energy, agrochemicals, and lubricants. Growth in demand in our specialty markets tends to be driven by the end-performance characteristics that our products deliver to our customers. These products are manufactured for use in a growing number of niche industrial end uses and have been characterized by growing demand, technology substitution and stable profitability. For example, we are one of two significant global producers of polyetheramines, for which our sales volumes have grown at a compound annual rate of over 7% in the last 10 years due to strong demand in a number of industrial applications, such as epoxy curing agents, oil drilling, agrochemicals, fuel additives and civil construction materials. We are the leading global licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology and are also the largest supplier of butane fixed bed catalyst used in the manufacture of maleic anhydride. Our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other Performance Products businesses and other segments. 

We consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, LAB, and ethanolamines products, which are primarily used as intermediates in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. We also produce EG, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and PET packaging. We operate 17 Performance Products manufacturing facilities in North America, EAME, Asia and Australia. 

We have the annual capacity to produce approximately 1.4 billion pounds of more than 200 amines and other performance chemicals. We believe we are the largest global producer of polyetheramines, one of the largest producers of 2-(2-amino ethoxy) ethanol, sold under our DGA&#174; 

brand, the second largest producer of ethyleneamines and morpholine and the second largest North American producer of ethanolamines. We are the only producer and largest supplier of propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate in North America. We also produce substituted propylamines. We use internally produced ethylene, EO, EG and PO in the manufacture of many of our amines and carbonates. Our products are manufactured at our Port Neches, Conroe, Dayton and Freeport, Texas facilities and at our facilities in Llanelli, U.K.; Petfurdo, Hungary; Ankleshwar, India; Jurong Island, Singapore; and Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Our amines are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications, including personal care products, polyurethane foam, fuel and lubricant additives, paints and coatings, composites, solvents and catalysts. Our key amines customers include Monsanto, Procter &#38; Gamble, Chevron, AkzoNobel, Lubrizol, Afton, and PPG. 

We have the capacity to produce approximately 2.1 billion pounds of surfactant products annually at our eight facilities located in North America, Europe, India and Australia. We are a leading global manufacturer of nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants products and are characterized by our breadth of product offering and market coverage. Our surfactant products are primarily used in consumer detergent and industrial cleaning applications. We are a leading European producer of components for powder and liquid laundry detergents and other cleaners. In addition, we manufacture and market a diversified range of specialty formulations for use in personal care applications. We continue to strengthen and diversify our surfactant product offering into formulated specialty surfactant products for use in various industrial applications such as agrochemicals, fuels and lubricants, polymers and coatings, leather and textile treatment, foundry and construction. Our key surfactants customers include Procter &#38; Gamble, Monsanto, L'Oreal, Nufarm, Henkel, and Unilever. 

We are North America's largest producer of LAB, with alkylation capacity of 400 million pounds per year at our plant in Chocolate Bayou, Texas. LAB is a surfactant intermediate which is converted into LAS, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. We also manufacture a higher-molecular-weight alkylate which is used as an additive to lubricants. Our key customers for LAB and specialty alkylates include Colgate, Lubrizol, Procter &#38; Gamble, and Unilever. 

We believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are mainly used in the production of fiberglass reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. We have the capacity to produce approximately 572 million pounds annually at our facilities located in Pensacola, Florida; Geismar, Louisiana; and Moers, Germany. We also license our maleic anhydride technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. Revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change schedules. Our key maleic anhydride customers include, AOC, Ashland, Bartek, CCP Composites, Cranston, Gulf Chemical, Lubrizol, Meadwestvaco, MFG Chemical, Reichhold and Tate &#38; Lyle. 

We also have the capacity to produce approximately 945 million pounds of EG annually at our facilities in Port Neches, Texas and Botany, Australia. 

We are currently expanding EO capacity at our Port Neches, Texas facility. The additional annual capacity of 265 million pounds is expected to come onstream during the second quarter of 2016. All of the additional EO will be used internally to leverage exisiting capacity for EO derivatives. 

Products and Markets 

Our global marketing groups are organized around three end markets: energy and resources, polymers and resins, and functional chemicals. 

Specialties. The following table shows the end-market applications for our specialty products: 

Product Group 

&#160; Applications Polyetheramines &#160; Polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, epoxy composites, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks, pigment dispersion Ethyleneamines &#160; Lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents, fungicides Ethanolamines &#160; Wood preservatives, herbicides, construction products, gas treatment, metalworking Specialty Amines &#160; Liquid soaps, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing, water treating Morpholine/DGA&#174; Agent &#160; Hydrocarbon processing, construction chemicals, synthetic rubber, water treating, electronics applications, gas treatment, agriculture Maleic Anhydride &#160; Boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper, and food additives Maleic Anhydride Catalyst and Technology Licensing &#160; Maleic anhydride, BDO and its derivatives, and PBT manufacturers Specialty Surfactants &#160; Agricultural herbicides, construction, paper de-inking, lubricants Specialty Alkylates &#160; Lubricant additive 

Amines. Amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives. Generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, detergent, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. Growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with GDP growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets. However, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have grown at rates well in excess of GDP growth due to new product development, technical innovation, and substitution and replacement of competing products. For example, polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials. Ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of EO with ammonia. They are used in the production of a variety of industrial, agricultural and consumer products. There are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. As amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. 

Morpholine/DGA&#174; Agent. Morpholine and DGA&#174; agent are produced as co-products by reacting ammonia with DEG. Morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing (as an accelerator) and flocculants for water treatment. DGA&#174; agent is primarily used in gas treating, electronics, herbicides and metalworking end-use applications. 

Carbonates. Ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting EO and PO with carbon dioxide. Carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating 

applications. They are also increasingly being used as a photo-resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards, solar panels, LCD screens and the production of lithium batteries. 

Maleic Anhydride and Licensing. Maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. The largest use of maleic anhydride in the U.S. is in the production of UPRs, which we believe account for approximately 48% of North American maleic anhydride demand. Total North American demand for maleic anhydride in 2015 was approximately 688 million pounds. Total European demand for maleic anhydride in 2015 was approximately 536 million pounds. Generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs. UPR is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins, which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. 

Our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy-efficient, high-percentage solvent recovery system. This process competes against two other processes, the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery. We believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. The maleic anhydride-based route to BDO manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include PO, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. As a result, the growth in demand for BDO has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. 

Intermediates. The following table sets forth the end-market applications for our intermediate products: 

Product Group 

&#160; Applications Surfactants &#160; &#160; Alkoxylates &#160; Household detergents, industrial cleaners, anti-fog chemicals for glass, asphalt emulsions, shampoos, polymerization additives, de-emulsifiers for petroleum production Sulfonates/Sulfates &#160; Powdered detergents, liquid detergents, shampoos, body washes, dishwashing liquids, industrial cleaners, emulsion polymerization, concrete superplasticizers, gypsum wallboard Esters and Derivatives &#160; Shampoo, body wash, textile and leather treatment Nitrogen Derivatives &#160; Bleach thickeners, baby shampoo, fabric conditioners, other personal care products Formulated Blends &#160; Household detergents, textile and leather treatment, personal care products, pharmaceutical intermediates EO/PO Block Co-Polymers &#160; Automatic dishwasher detergents LAB &#160; Consumer detergents, industrial and institutional detergents EG &#160; Polyester fibers and PET bottle resins, heat transfer and hydraulic fluids, chemical intermediates, natural gas and hydrocarbon treating agents, unsaturated polyester resins, polyester polyols, plasticizers, solvents 

Surfactants. Surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule. While surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries. 

Demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. The main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties. For basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. 

LAB. LAB is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. Nearly all the LAB produced globally is converted into LAS, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. 

Three major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for LAB in North America: Procter &#38; Gamble, Henkel and The Sun Products Corporation. We believe that over half of the LAB global capacity lies in the hands of seven producers, with two to three major producers in each of the three regional markets. Growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than GDP. We have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market. With a significant technical barrier to entry, our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus LAB-only producers. 

EG. We consume our internally produced EO to produce three types of EG: MEG, DEG and TEG. MEG is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. DEG is consumed internally for the production of Morpholine and DGA&#174; agent and polyols. TEG is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. We continue to optimize our EO and EG operations depending on the fundamental market demand for EG. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell over 2,000 products to over 4,000 customers globally through our Performance Products sales groups, which have extensive market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. 

In our specialty markets (energy and resources, polymers and resins, and functional chemicals), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications. We believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers. 

Our intermediates are sold mainly into the global home and personal care market. We also sell EG. 

We also provide extensive pre-and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. Finally, these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. In addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products. These distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end-use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

Our Performance Products segment has the capacity to produce more than seven billion pounds annually of a wide variety of products and formulations at 17 manufacturing locations in North America, EAME, Asia and Australia. These production capacities are as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Current capacity Product Area

(1) Asia-Pacific region including India ("APAC"). (2) Includes up to 30 million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from Dow's Terneuzen, The Netherlands facility by way of a long-term supply arrangement and 60 million pounds from Arabian Amines Company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, located in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. (3) Represents total capacity of a facility owned by Sasol-Huntsman, of which we own a 50% equity interest and Sasol owns the remaining 50% interest. We have consolidated the financial results of this entity since April 2011. 

Our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally, with broad capabilities in amination, sulfonation and ethoxylation. These facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation. 

Our primary ethylene, propylene, EO, EG and ethanolamines facilities are located in Port Neches, Texas alongside our Polyurethanes' PO/MTBE facility. The Port Neches, Texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure, which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products. 

A number of our facilities are located within large integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes. We believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand-alone operations. These include our LAB facility in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, our maleic anhydride facilities in Pensacola, Florida and Moers, Germany and our ethyleneamines facility in Freeport, Texas. 

Joint Ventures 

Ethyleneamines Joint Venture. Since July 1, 2010, we have consolidated the results of Arabian Amines Company, our 50%-owned joint venture with the Zamil Group. Arabian Amines Company 

operates an ethyleneamines manufacturing plant in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The plant has an approximate annual capacity of 60 million pounds. We purchase and sell all of the production from this joint venture. 

Maleic Anhydride Joint Venture. Since the second quarter of 2011, we have consolidated the results of Sasol-Huntsman, our 50%-owned maleic anhydride joint venture. This entity operates a manufacturing facility in Moers, Germany with the capacity to produce 232 million pounds of maleic anhydride. The output from the facility is sold in the European region. 

Raw Materials 

We have the capacity to produce 460 million pounds of ethylene and 300 million pounds of propylene, depending on feedstocks, at our Port Neches, Texas facility. All of the ethylene is used to produce EO and all of the propylene is used to produce PO at our Port Neches, Texas facility (primarily for our Polyurethanes segment). We have the capacity to use approximately 900 million pounds of ethylene each year in the production of EO and ethyleneamines. Accordingly, we purchase or toll the remainder of our ethylene requirements from third parties. We consume all of our EO in the manufacture of our EG, surfactants, carbonates and amines products. We also use internally produced PO and DEG in the manufacture of these products. 

In addition to internally produced raw materials, the main raw materials used in the production of our amines are ethylene dichloride, caustic soda, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and acrylonitrile. The majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. 

In the production of surfactants and LAB, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced EO and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols, paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonylphenol. All of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices. 

Maleic anhydride is produced by the reaction of n-butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. The principal raw material is n-butane which is purchased pursuant to long-term contracts and delivered to our Pensacola, Florida site by barge, to our facility in Geismar, Louisiana via pipeline and to our Moers, Germany site by railcar. Our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll-manufactured by a third party under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. These raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 

Competition 

In our specialty markets, there are relatively few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product formulations, the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved. Some of our global competitors include BASF, Air Products, Dow, Tosoh and AkzoNobel. We compete primarily on the basis of product performance, new product innovation and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of price. In our maleic anhydride market, we compete primarily on the basis of price, customer service, technical support and logistics management. Our competitors include Lanxess, Flint Hills Resources, Bartek, Polynt and Ashland. We are the leading global producer of maleic anhydride catalyst. Competitors in our maleic anhydride catalyst market include Scientific Design, Ineos, BASF and Polynt. In our maleic anhydride technology licensing market, our primary competitor is Scientific Design. We compete primarily on the basis of technological performance and service. 

There are numerous global producers of many of our intermediate products. Our main competitors include global companies such as Dow/MEGlobal, Sasol, BASF, Petresa, Clariant, Shell, Stepan, Croda and Kao, as well as various smaller or more local competitors. We compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our intermediate product offerings and, to a lesser degree, on the basis of product availability, performance and service with respect to certain of our more value-added products. 

The market in which our Performance Products segment operates is highly competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. If any of our current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.

Sales and Marketing 

We maintain multiple routes to market to service our diverse customer base. These routes to market range from using our own direct sales force for targeted, technically-oriented distribution to mass distribution. Our direct sales force focuses on engineering solutions for our major customers who purchase significant amounts of product from us. We use technically-oriented specialist distributors to augment our sales effort in niche markets and applications where we do not believe it is appropriate to develop direct sales resources. We use mass general distribution channels to sell our products into a wide range of general applications where technical expertise is less important, which reduces our overall selling expenses. We believe our use of multiple routes to market enables us to reach a broader customer base at an efficient cost. 

We conduct sales activities through dedicated regional sales teams in EAME, Asia and the Americas. Our global customers are covered by key account managers who are familiar with the specific requirements of these customers. The management of long-standing customer relationships is at critical to the sales and marketing process. We are also supported by a strong network of distributors. We serve a highly fragmented customer base in all our regions. 

For our consumer/DIY range, with the exception of the Indian market, we have entered into exclusive branding and distribution arrangements. Under these arrangements, our distribution partners 

fund advertising and sales promotions, negotiate and sell to major retail chains, own inventories and provide store deliveries (and sometimes shelf merchandising) in exchange for ARALDITE&#174; branded, ready-to-sell packaged products. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, Asia and the Americas. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to our customers. Our facilities in Asia are well-positioned to take advantage of the market growth that is expected in these regions. The following table summarizes the plants that we operate:

(1) Leased land and/or building. (2) 95%-owned and consolidated manufacturing joint venture with Guangzhou Sheng'an Package Company Limited. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol A, MDA, phenol and aminophenols. We also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of the costs for certain applications. We have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. Formula pricing is sometimes used if advantageous for the business. 

Additionally, we produce large volumes of some of our most important raw materials, such as BLR and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products. Approximately 65% of the BLR we produce is consumed internally in our downstream products. The balance of our BLR is sold in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall BLR production cost. We believe that manufacturing a large proportion of our own BLR gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems formulators, who buy BLR from third-party suppliers. This position helps protect us from pricing pressure from BLR suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of BLR in difficult market conditions. 

We consume certain amines produced by our Performance Products segment and isocyanates produced by our Polyurethanes segment, which we use to formulate Advanced Materials products. 

Competition 

The markets in which our Advanced Materials segment operates are highly competitive, and are dependent on significant capital investment, the development of proprietary technology and maintenance of product research and development. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated companies that have their own raw material resources.

Textile Effects 

General 

Our Textile Effects segment is a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals, dyes and inks in our chosen markets. Our textile solutions enhance the color of finished textiles and improve such performance characteristics as wrinkle resistance and the ability to repel water and stains. Our Textile Effects segment is characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets and new applications. 

We operate synthesis, formulating and production facilities in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We market multiple products to customers in multiple end-markets, including the following: consumer fashion apparel, sportswear, career and uniform apparel, military, automotive, home textiles and furnishings, carpet and other functional textiles. 

During 2011, our Textile Effects segment began implementing a significant restructuring program, including the closure of our production facilities and business support offices in Basel, Switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the segment's long-term global competitiveness and designed to reduce annualized costs by approximately $75 million. In connection with this program, during 2015, our Textile Effects segment recorded charges of $9 million for non-cancelable long-term contract termination costs, $21 million for decommissioning and $1 million of other restructuring costs associated with this initiative. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we settled certain of our obligations under these long-term contracts and recorded a restructuring charge of $14 million. In addition, we recorded charges of $6 million associated with other initiatives. 

Products and Markets 

Textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion apparel to bulletproof vests, home linens to carpet, and upholstery to automotive interiors. Our broad range of dyestuffs, chemicals and inks enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products and the functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end-use markets. Since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on the three major markets&#151;apparel, home and institutional and technical textiles. We work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical challenges in each of these markets. Our Textile Effects segment is affected by seasonal holiday closures and typically experiences lower sales in those periods. For example, we typically experience lower sales in Asia in the first quarter as a result of the Lunar New Year, in Europe as a result of the summer holidays, and in the Americas and Europe during the Christmas season at year-end. 

The apparel market focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect and/or improve the processing efficiency within the textile mill. We offer a complete range of colors for cotton, polyester and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for sportswear, intimate apparel, towels, sheeting and casual wear. Our dyes have been developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels of wash fastness currently available in the market. Optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide "bright white" effects for apparel, towels and sheeting. Pretreatment and dyeing auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and effectively&#151;cleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. Silicone softeners may be used to enhance the feel of products. 

Technical textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics, mattress ticking and nonwoven and other technical fabrics. Though the product groups may differ in their end uses, the articles must provide a high-level of functionality and performance in their respective markets. High-lightfast dyes and UV absorbers are used in automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings to provide colors that do not fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. Powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without affecting the color, breathability or feel of the fabric. Specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms, backpacks and tarps that will not fade through wash and wear or during exposure to the elements. 

Sales and Marketing 

For our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. Effect competence&#151;delivering value-added effects to our customers' products&#151;enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to differentiate themselves from competitors. Process competence&#151;applying know-how and expertise to improve customers' processes&#151;allows us to utilize our technical service to reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, the Americas and Asia. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to our customers. The following table summarizes the plants that we operate:

Raw Materials 

The manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,000 different chemicals), including amines, fluorochemicals and sulfones. No one raw material represents greater than 5% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. We have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. 

Competition 

We are a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets. Competition within the textile chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who offer complete solutions for both markets. Our major competitors are Archroma (businesses formerly owned by Clariant and BASF), Kiri-Dystar and Longsheng. We believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad range; high quality; significant integration between products and service; reliable technical expertise; long-standing relationships with customers; and strong business infrastructure in Asia. We believe that we have more customer service capability and account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide. 

Pigments and Additives 

General 

We are a diversified global supplier of pigments and additives. Our pigments and additives improve performance and add color to thousands of everyday items including paints, inks, plastics, concrete, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food. We offer a wide range of products across the color spectrum. Our broad product range, coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. 

We operate 31 manufacturing facilities. Our ten titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities are predominately located in Europe and our 16 color pigments manufacturing and processing facilities are mainly located in Europe and the United States. We also operate five facilities producing water treatment, timber treatment chemicals and functional additives. 

On October 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide businesses ("the Rockwood Acquisition") of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. ("Rockwood"). We paid $1.02 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded pension liabilities in connection with the Rockwood Acquisition. For more information, see "Note 3. Business Combinations" to our consolidated financial statements. 

In connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the Rockwood Acquisition, we sold our TiO2 TR52 product line used in printing inks to Henan Billions Chemicals Co., Ltd. ("Henan") in December 2014. The sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply TR52 product to Henan during a transitional period. 

On December 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our Pigments and Additives segment. As part of a comprehensive restructuring program, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 900 positions. Annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $140 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. In connection with this restructuring program, during 2015 we recorded restructuring expense 

of $61 million for workforce reduction, $3 million for pension related charges and $15 million in other restructuring costs associated with this initiative. 

On February 12, 2015, we announced a plan to close the 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities at our Calais, France site, which reduced our titanium dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kilotons, or 13% of our European titanium dioxide capacity. In connection with this announcement, we began to accelerate depreciation on the affected assets and recorded accelerated depreciation in 2015 of $68 million as restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. In addition, during 2015, we recorded charges of $30 million primarily for workforce reductions and non-cash charges of $17 million. The 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities are now closed. The 'white end' of the site continues to operate. 

On March 4, 2015, we announced plans to restructure our color pigments business, another step in our previously announced plan to significantly restructure our global Pigments and Additives segment, and recorded restructuring expense of approximately $4 million during 2015 primarily related to workforce reductions. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the South African asset group of our Pigments and Additives segment was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $19 million. 

We remain committed to a separation of our titanium dioxide business and we are actively exploring additional possibilities outside of an initial public offering or a spin-off. Our ability to effect such separation is subject to, among other things, market conditions and the approval of our Board of Directors. See "&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors." 

Products and Markets 

Titanium Dioxide. We are a global leader in the manufacture and marketing of specialty and standard grade titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is derived from titanium bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items including paints, plastics, paper, inks, fibers, food and personal care products. 

We own a portfolio of brands including the TIOXIDE&#174;, HOMBITAN&#174;, DELTIO&#174;, and ALTIRIS&#174; ranges, which are produced in our ten manufacturing facilities around the globe. We service over 2,500 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. Our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including Ampacet, A. Schulman, AkzoNobel, BASF, Clariant, Jotun, PolyOne, PPG and Sun Chemical. 

Global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track GDP growth rates; however, this varies by region. Developed markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as Asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. The titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end-use markets. Coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

There are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. We currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 45% of global production capacity. Most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing route&#151;for example, the inks market prefers sulfate and the automotive coatings market 

prefers chloride. Regional markets typically favor products that are available locally. The sulfate process produces titanium dioxide in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. 

Our Company is one of the five major producers of titanium dioxide in the world. Beyond these producers, the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or local producers, particularly in China. Titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks, efficiency improvements and, more recently, new capacity additions in China. During periods of low titanium dioxide demand, the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital. Pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply/demand balance. 

We have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher margins, higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships.

Iron oxide pigment's cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, for coatings such as paints and plastics. We are one of two large color pigments producers which represent approximately 40% of the global market for iron oxide pigments. The remaining market share consists primarily of Chinese competitors. 

Made from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. Ultramarine blue is used world-wide for food contact applications. Our synthetic ultramarines are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. Ultramarine blue is used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. We focus on supplying our customers with technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry. 

We are constructing a new advanced technology production facility in Augusta, Georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments. We are the first iron oxide pigments producer to invest in U.S. based capacity in more than 35 years. The new Augusta facility will enable significant plant consolidation, cost savings opportunities and favorable raw material sourcing while reinforcing our color pigments offering of quality pigment, service and shortened lead time on delivery. We expect the Augusta facility to be complete in the first quarter of 2016. 

Copper, iron and alkali are raw materials for the manufacture of iron oxide pigments. They are used to produce colored pigment particles which are further processed into a finished pigment in powder, liquid, granule or blended powder form. 

Timber Treatment Chemicals. We manufacture timber treatment wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications to prolong the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. 

We manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the U.S. and market our products primarily in North America through Viance, LLC ("Viance"), our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical formed in 2007. Our residential construction products such as ACQ, ECOLIFE&#153; and Copper Azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures. Our industrial construction products such as Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings. 

Water Treatment Chemicals. We manufacture water treatment chemicals in Germany used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications. We are one of Europe's largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) based flocculants with approximately 140 kilotons of production capacity. Main markets are municipal and industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry. 

Sales and Marketing 

Approximately 85% of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our global sales and technical services network, enabling us to work closely with our customers. Our focused sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products. 

We sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. We sell the majority of our timber treatment products directly to end customers via Viance. 

Our focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. For example, we believe that our Pigments and Additives segment is well-positioned to benefit from growth sectors where customers' needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. We maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. 

Much of our research and development is focused on solutions that address significant emerging trends in the market.

(1) This facility is owned and operated by Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., a manufacturing joint venture that is owned 50% by us and 50% by Kronos. The capacity shown reflects our 50% interest in Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. 

Joint Ventures 

Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. is our 50%-owned joint venture with Kronos. We share production offtake and operating costs of the plant with Kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. The operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. is accounted for using the equity method. 

Viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical. Viance markets our timber treatment products. Our joint venture interest in Viance was acquired as part of the Rockwood 

Acquisition on October 1, 2014. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance's behalf. As a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and began consolidating Viance upon the Rockwood Acquisition on October 1, 2014. 

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials used in our Pigments and Additives segment are titanium-bearing ores and iron oxide particles. 

&#160; &#160; Titanium Dioxide &#160; Functional Additives &#160; Color Pigments &#160; Timber Treatment &#160; Water Chemicals Primary raw materials &#160; Titanium bearing ore, sulfuric acid &#160; Barium and zinc based inorganics &#160; Iron oxide particles, scrap iron, coppers &#160; DCOIT, copper, monoethanolamine &#160; Aluminum oxide 

In recent years, we have purchased the majority of our ores under supply contracts from a range of ore suppliers. The majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from India, Africa, Canada and Norway. Ore accounts for approximately 45% of titanium dioxide variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs. 

The world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest suppliers (Rio Tinto, Kenmare, Iluka and Tronox) accounting for approximately 40% of global supply between them and from whom we purchase approximately 65% of our needs. The majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is now transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume-contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per annum. This form of market-based ore contracts has introduced more flexibility and responsiveness, both in terms of pricing and quantity obligations. 

Titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process. Once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. The finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product's performance characteristics. 

Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our Pigments and Additives segment. We sell over 60% of the co-products generated by our business. 

We source our raw material for the majority of our Color Pigments business from China, the U.S., France and Italy. Key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 

Competition 

The global markets in which our Pigments and Additives segment operates are highly competitive and vary according to product. 

Competition within the standard grade titanium dioxide market is based on price, product quality and service. The major global producers against whom we compete are Chemours, Tronox, Kronos and Cristal, each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets. If any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the sulfate based titanium dioxide technology used by our Pigments and Additives segment is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 

Competition within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and, to a certain extent, price. Key competitors for barium-based additives include Solvay S.A., Gruppo Chimico Dalton S.p.A., Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. and Chinese barium producers. Key competitors for zinc-based additives include Chinese lithopone producers. 

Competition within the specialty titanium dioxide market and the color pigments market is based on customer service, product attributes, such as product form and quality, and price. Product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. Our primary competitors within specialty titanium dioxide include Fuj Titanium Industry, Kronos and Precheza. Our primary competitors within color pigments include Lanxess AG, Cathay Pigments Group, Interstar Materials Inc. and Shanghai Yipin Pigments Co., Ltd. 

Competition within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology and product range. Our primary competitors are Lonza Group and Koppers. 

Competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. Our primary competitors are Kemira and Feralco. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we spent $160 million, $158 million and $140 million, respectively, on research and development. 

We support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. Our research and development centers are located in The Woodlands, Texas; Everberg, Belgium; and Shanghai, China. Other regional development/technical service centers are located in Wynyard, England and Duisburg, Germany (pigments); Auburn Hills, Michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); Derry, New Hampshire, Shanghai, China, Deggendorf, Germany and Ternate, Italy (polyurethanes); Melbourne, Australia (surfactants); Port Neches, Texas (process engineering support); Basel, Switzerland and Panyu, China (advanced materials and textile effects); and Mumbai, India (textile effects). 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 

Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. We own approximately 440 unexpired U.S. patents, approximately 135 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and approximately 4,180 foreign issued patents and pending patent applications. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not 

be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 

In addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties. 

We have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 175 U.S. trademark registrations (including applications for registration currently pending at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), and approximately 4,700 foreign trademark registrations and applications for registration. Some of these registrations and applications include filings under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 

Because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,000 associates in our operations around the world. Approximately 3,000 of these employees are located in the U.S., while approximately 12,000 are located in other countries. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

GEOGRAPHIC DATA 

For sales revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see "Note 25. Operating Segment Information" to our consolidated financial statements. 

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS 

General 

We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to environmental, health and safety ("EHS") matters may also be found in other areas of this report including "&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors," "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#151;Environmental Expenditures" to our consolidated financial statements and "Note 20. Environmental Health and Safety Matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Systems 

We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 

Environmental Remediation 

We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

In cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. We have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. We cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 

Based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a 

material effect on our financial statements. However, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contamination sites. 

Regulatory Matters 

Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change 

Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the European Union, agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the European Union GHG Emissions Trading System ("ETS"), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the European Union, continues in its third phase. The European Union parliament continues with a process to formalized "backloading"&#151;the withholding of GHG allowances to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. The European Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve at the beginning of the next trading period in 2021. In addition, the European Union has recently announced the binding target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. The European Commission proposed an objective of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the European Union's energy consumption by 2030. The European Council endorsed this target, which is binding at the European Union level. The European Commission also proposed a 30% energy savings target for 2030. The European Council, however, endorsed an indicative target of 27% to be reviewed in 2020 having in mind a 30% target. 

Federal climate change legislation in the U.S. appears unlikely in the near-term. As a result, domestic efforts to curb GHG emissions will continue to be led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (the "EPA") GHG regulations and the efforts of states. To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA's GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the Clean Air Act's (the "CAA") Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements under the EPA's GHG "Tailoring Rule." Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs. 

Under a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the EPA is due to propose new source performance standards for GHG emissions from refineries. These standards could significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. Either of these events could have an adverse effect on our business. 

We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 

Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations
