 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; In this report, we use the terms "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" to refer to AECOM and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise noted, references to years are for fiscal years. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Friday closest to September 30. For clarity of presentation, we present all periods as if the year ended on September 30. We refer to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as "fiscal 2015" and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as "fiscal 2016." 

Overview 

We are a leading fully integrated firm positioned to design, build, finance and operate infrastructure assets for governments, businesses and organizations in more than 150 countries. We provide planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government markets. We also provide construction services, including building construction and energy, infrastructure and industrial construction. In addition, we provide program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance, and systems integration and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government and also for national governments around the world. According to Engineering News-Record 's (ENR's) 2016 Design Survey, we are the largest general architectural and engineering design firm in the world, ranked by 2015 design revenue. In addition, we are ranked by ENR as the leading firm in a number of design end markets, including transportation and general building. 

We were formed in 1980 as Ashland Technology Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, Inc., an oil and gas refining and distribution company. Since becoming independent of Ashland Inc., we have grown by a combination of organic growth and strategic mergers and acquisitions from approximately 3,300 employees and $387 million in revenue in fiscal 1991, the first full fiscal year of independent operations, to approximately 87,000 employees at September 30, 2016 and $17.4 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2007 and these shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 

As mentioned above, we have grown in part by strategic mergers and acquisitions. These acquisitions have included URS Corporation, a leading provider of engineering, construction, and technical services for public agencies and private sector companies around the world, in October 2014. URS provides services for federal, oil and gas, infrastructure, power, and industrial projects and programs. Other acquisitions included Hunt Construction Group, a leading commercial construction firm, in July 2014. 

We also have formed AECOM Capital, an investment fund to invest in public-private partnership (P3) and private-sector real estate projects for which we can provide a fully integrated solution that includes equity capital, design, engineering, construction services and operations and maintenance. In addition, we leverage our practical knowledge of P3s and other forms of alternative delivery to enable clients to fund their projects without direct investment by AECOM. 

Our business strategy focuses on leveraging our competitive strengths, leadership positions in our core markets, and client relationships across all major geographies. We have created an integrated delivery platform with superior capabilities to design, build, finance and operate infrastructure assets around the world. By integrating and providing a broad range of services, we deliver maximum value to our clients at competitive costs. Also, by coordinating and consolidating our knowledge base, we believe we have the ability to export our leading edge technical skills to any region in the world in which our clients may need them. 

Our Business Segments 

In fiscal 2014, we operated our business under two primary business segments: Professional Technical Services and Management Support Services which included the following services: 

&#149; Professional Technical Services. Planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design, and program and construction management services to commercial and government clients worldwide in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. &#149; Management Support Services. Program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems integration services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government. After the acquisition of URS Corporation in our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we realigned our business into three primary business segments to reflect the operations of the combined company, which included expanded ability to deliver fully integrated project execution. The realigned business segments are organized by the types of services provided, the differing specialized needs of the respective clients, and how we manage our business. We have aggregated various operating segments into reportable business segments based on their similar characteristics, including similar long-term financial performance, the nature of services provided, internal processes for delivering those services, and types of customers. The three realigned business segments are: Design and Consulting Services (DCS), Construction Services (CS), and Management Services (MS), which include the following services: 

&#149; Design and Consulting Services (DCS): Planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. &#149; Construction Services (CS): Construction services, including building construction and energy, infrastructure and industrial construction, primarily in the Americas. &#149; Management Services (MS): Program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance, and systems integration and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government and other national governments around the world. Our Design and Consulting Services Segment 

Our DCS segment comprises a broad array of services, generally provided on a fee-for-service basis. These services include planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design, program management and construction management for industrial, commercial, institutional and government clients worldwide. For each of these services, our technical expertise includes civil, structural, process, mechanical, geotechnical systems and electrical engineering, architectural, landscape and interior design, urban and regional planning, project economics, cost consulting and environmental, health and safety work. 

With our technical and management expertise, we are able to provide our clients a broad spectrum of services. For example, within our environmental management service offerings, we provide remediation, regulatory compliance planning and management, environmental modeling, environmental impact assessment and environmental permitting for major capital/infrastructure projects. 

Our services may be sequenced over multiple phases. For example, in the area of program management and construction management services, our work for a client may begin with a small consulting or planning contract, and may later develop into an overall management role for the project or a series of projects, which we refer to as a program. Program and construction management contracts typically employ a staff of 10 to more than 100 and, in many cases, operate as an outsourcing arrangement with our staff located at the project site. 

We provide the services in our DCS segment both directly and through joint ventures or similar partner arrangements to the following end markets or business sectors:

Other than the U.S. federal government, no single client accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any of the past five fiscal years. Approximately 23%, 24% and 15% of our revenue was derived through direct contracts with agencies of the U.S. federal government in the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One of these contracts accounted for approximately 3%, 2% and 3% of our revenue in the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The work attributed to the U.S. federal government includes our work for the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. 

Contracts 

The price provisions of the contracts we undertake can be grouped into several broad categories: cost-reimbursable contracts, guaranteed maximum price contracts, and fixed-price contracts. 

Cost-Reimbursable Contracts 

Cost-reimbursable contracts consist of two similar contract types: (1) cost-plus contracts and (2) time and material price contracts. 

Cost-Plus Contracts. We enter into two major types of cost-plus contracts: 

Cost-Plus Fixed Fee. Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. The total estimated cost plus the fixed negotiated fee represents the total contract value. We recognize revenue based on the actual labor and other direct costs incurred, plus the portion of the fixed fee earned to date. 

Cost-Plus Fixed Rate. Under cost-plus fixed rate contracts, we charge clients for our direct and indirect costs based upon a negotiated rate. We recognize revenue based on the actual total costs expended and the applicable fixed rate. 

Some cost-plus contracts provide for award fees or a penalty based on performance criteria in lieu of a fixed fee or fixed rate. Other contracts include a base fee component plus a performance-based award fee. In addition, we may share award fees with subcontractors. We record accruals for fee-sharing as fees are earned. We generally recognize revenue to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate 

amount of the fee expected to be earned. We take the award fee or penalty on contracts into consideration when estimating revenue and profit rates, and record revenue related to the award fees when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. On contracts that represent higher than normal risk or technical difficulty, we may defer all award fees until an award fee letter is received. Once an award fee letter is received, the estimated or accrued fees are adjusted to the actual award amount. 

Some cost-plus contracts provide for incentive fees based on performance against contractual milestones. The amount of the incentive fees varies, depending on whether we achieve above, at, or below target results. We originally recognize revenue on these contracts based upon expected results. These estimates are revised when necessary based upon additional information that becomes available as the contract progresses. 

Time and Material Price Contracts. Time and material contracts are common for smaller scale engineering and consulting services. Under these types of contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based upon actual hours expended on a project. Unlike cost-plus contracts, however, there is no predetermined fee. In addition, any direct project expenditures are passed through to the client and are reimbursed. These contracts may also have a fixed-price element in the form of not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provisions. 

Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts 

Guaranteed maximum price contracts (GMP) are common for design-build and commercial and residential projects. GMP contracts share many of the same contract provisions as cost-plus and fixed-price contracts. A contractor performing work pursuant to a cost-plus, GMP or fixed-price contract will all enter into trade contracts directly. Both cost-plus and GMP contracts generally include an agreed lump sum or percentage fee which is called out and separately identified and the contracts are considered 'open' book providing the owner with full disclosure of the project costs. A fixed-price contract provides the owner with a single lump sum amount without specifically identifying the breakdown of fee or costs and is typically 'closed' book thereby providing the owner with little detail as to the project costs. In a GMP contract, unlike the cost-plus contract, we provide the owner with a guaranteed price for the overall construction (adjusted for change orders issued by the owner) and with a schedule which includes a completion date for the project. In addition, cost overruns in a GMP contract would generally be our responsibility and in the event our actions or inactions result in delays to the project, we may be responsible to the owner for costs associated with such delay. For many of our commercial and residential GMP contracts, the final price is generally not established until we have awarded a substantial percentage of the trade contracts and we have negotiated additional contractual limitations, such as mutual waivers of consequential damages as well as aggregate caps on liabilities and liquidated damages. 

Fixed-Price Contracts 

There are typically two types of fixed-price contracts. Lump sum contracts involve performing all of the work under the contract for a specified lump sum fee and are typically subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen conditions arise. In such cases, we will submit formal requests for adjustment of the lump sum via formal change orders or contract amendments. The second type, fixed-unit price, involves performing an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units delivered. 

Our fixed-price contracts are typically negotiated and arise in the design or construction of a project with a specified scope rather than hard bid where the client primarily selects the lowest qualified bidder. Fixed-price contracts often arise in the areas of construction management and design-build services. Construction management services are typically in the form of general administrative oversight (in which we do not assume responsibility for construction means and methods). Under our design-build projects, we are typically responsible for the design or construction of a project with the fixed contract price negotiated 

after we have had the opportunity to secure specific bids from various subcontractors including a contingency fee. 

We may attempt to mitigate the risks of fixed-price design-build contracts by contracting to complete the projects based on our design as opposed to a third party's design, by not guaranteeing new or untested processes or technologies and by working only with experienced subcontractors with sufficient bonding capacity. 

Some of our fixed-price contracts require us to provide surety bonds or parent company guarantees to assure our clients that their project will be completed in accordance with the terms of the contracts as further disclosed in Note 18&#151;Commitments and Contingencies. In such cases, we may require our primary subcontractors to provide similar performance bonds and guarantees and to be adequately insured, and we may flow down the terms and conditions set forth in our agreement on to our subcontractors. There may be risks associated with completing these projects profitably if we are not able to perform our services within the fixed-price contract terms. 

At September 30, 2016, our contracted backlog was comprised of 44%, 33%, and 23% cost-reimbursable, guaranteed maximum price, and fixed-price contracts, respectively. 

Joint Ventures 

Some of our larger contracts may operate under joint ventures or other arrangements under which we team with other reputable companies, typically companies with which we have worked for many years. This is often done where the scale of the project dictates such an arrangement or when we want to strengthen either our market position or our technical skills. 

Backlog 

Backlog represents revenue we expect to realize for work completed by our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and therefore may include significant estimated amounts of third party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties. Backlog for our consolidated subsidiaries is comprised of contracted backlog and awarded backlog. Our contracted backlog includes revenue we expect to record in the future from signed contracts, and in the case of a public client, where the project has been funded. Our awarded backlog includes revenue we expect to record in the future where we have been awarded the work, but the contractual agreement has not yet been signed. The net results of our unconsolidated joint ventures are recognized as equity earnings, and awarded and contracted backlog representing our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures is not presented as revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For non-government contracts, our backlog includes future revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client. For contracts with a not-to-exceed maximum amount, we include revenue from such contracts in backlog to the extent of the remaining estimated amount. We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations until such changes or cancellations occur. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full backlog. Backlog fluctuates due to the timing of when contracts are awarded and contracted and when contract revenue is recognized. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year. Our backlog for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.3 billion, or 0.7%, to $42.8 billion as compared to $43.1 billion for the corresponding period last year, primarily due to the decrease in our MS segment. 

The following summarizes contracted and awarded backlog (in billions):

Competition 

The markets we serve are highly fragmented and we compete with a large number of regional, national and international companies. We have numerous competitors, ranging from small private firms to multi-billion dollar companies, some of which have greater financial resources or that are more specialized and concentrate their resources in particular areas of expertise. The extent of our competition varies according to the particular markets and geographic area. The degree and type of competition we face is also influenced by the type and scope of a particular project. The technical and professional aspects of our services generally do not require large upfront capital expenditures and, therefore, provide limited barriers against new competitors. 

We believe that we are well positioned to compete in our markets because of our reputation, our cost effectiveness, our long-term client relationships, our extensive network of offices, our employee expertise, and our broad range of services. In addition, as a result of our extensive national and international network, we are able to offer our clients localized knowledge and expertise, as well as the support of our worldwide professional staff. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal trends in our business. Our revenue is typically higher in the last half of the fiscal year. The fourth quarter of our fiscal year (July 1 to September 30) is typically our strongest quarter. We find that the U.S. federal government tends to authorize more work during the period preceding the end of our fiscal year, September 30. In addition, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. Further, our construction management revenue typically increases during the high construction season of 

the summer months. Within the United States, as well as other parts of the world, our business generally benefits from milder weather conditions in our fiscal fourth quarter, which allows for more productivity from our on-site civil services. Our construction and project management services also typically expand during the high construction season of the summer months. The first quarter of our fiscal year (October 1 to December 31) is typically our weakest quarter. The harsher weather conditions impact our ability to complete work in parts of North America and the holiday season schedule affects our productivity during this period. For these reasons, coupled with the number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during a particular period, as well as the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives, it is not unusual for us to experience seasonal changes or fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. 

Risk Management and Insurance 

Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach and our project execution process. We have an Office of Risk Management that reviews and oversees the risk profile of our operations. Also, pursuant to our internal delegations of authority, we have an internal process whereby a group of senior members of our risk management team evaluate risk through internal risk analyses of higher-risk projects, contracts or other business decisions. We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury and property damage. Wherever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods. 

Regulations 

Our business is impacted by environmental, health and safety, government procurement, anti-bribery and other government regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business. 

Environmental, Health and Safety. Our business involves the planning, design, program management, construction and construction management, and operations and maintenance at various project sites, including but not limited to pollution control systems, nuclear facilities, hazardous waste and Superfund sites, contract mining sites, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport sites, military bases and other infrastructure-related facilities. We also regularly perform work, including oil field and pipeline construction services in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. In addition, we have contracts with U.S. federal government entities to destroy hazardous materials, including chemical agents and weapons stockpiles, as well as to decontaminate and decommission nuclear facilities. These activities may require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances. 

Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed. For example, there are a number of governmental laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and comparable national and state laws, that impose strict, joint and several liabilities for the entire cost of cleanup, without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental regulations can impose liability for the entire clean-up upon owners, operators, generators, transporters and other persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such hazardous substances costs related to contaminated facilities or project sites. Other federal environmental, health and safety laws 

affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, as well as other comparable national and state laws. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, comparable national and state laws or a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities. 

Some of our business operations are covered by Public Law 85-804, which provides for indemnification by the U.S federal government against claims and damages arising out of unusually hazardous or nuclear activities performed at the request of the U.S. federal government. Should public policies and laws change, however, U.S. federal government indemnification may not be available in the case of any future claims or liabilities relating to hazardous activities that we undertake to perform. 

Government Procurement. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), the Services Contract Act, export controls rules and DOD security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience; and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually. 

Anti-Bribery and other regulations. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that "fails to prevent bribery" committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented "adequate procedures" to prevent bribery. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries. We provide services to the DOD and other defense-related entities that often require specialized professional qualifications and security clearances. In addition, as engineering design services professionals, we are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign licensing and permit requirements and ethics rules. 

Personnel 

Our principal asset is our employees and large percentages of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees. At the end of our fiscal 2016, we employed approximately 87,000 persons, of whom approximately 46,000 were employed in the United States. Over 10,000 of our domestic employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or by specific labor agreements, which expire upon completion of the relevant project. 

Geographic Information 

For financial geographic information, please refer to Note 19 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Raw Materials 

We purchase most of the raw materials and components necessary to operate our business from numerous sources. However, the price and availability of raw materials and components may vary from year to year due to customer demand, production capacity, market conditions and material shortages. While we do not currently foresee the lack of availability of any particular raw materials in the near term, prolonged unavailability of raw materials necessary to our projects and services or significant price increases for those raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term. 

Government Contracts 

Generally, our government contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the discretion of the U.S. federal, state or local governments, and national governments of other countries. 

Trade Secrets and Other Intellectual Property 

We rely principally on trade secrets, confidentiality policies and other contractual arrangements to protect much of our intellectual property.
