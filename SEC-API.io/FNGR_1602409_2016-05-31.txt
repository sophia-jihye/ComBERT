 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Overview 

&#160; 

Property Management Corporation of America (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;PMCA&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on January 23, 2014. Our principal executive office is located at 4174 Old Stockyard Road, Suite F, Marshall, Virginia 20115. Our main telephone number is (540) 364-8131.

&#160;

We offer management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or lease their property to third party tenants. Our services are currently offered in Fauquier County, Virginia, but it is our intention to expand our services statewide. We currently manage two properties in Fauquier County, Virginia, which include residential and commercial space, and our recurring monthly revenues from these properties are approximately $1,120. Messer&#8217;s McMillen, our Chairman, and Brigante, our Acting Chief Executive Officer, President and CFO, and our only two directors, have a combined 55% ownership interest in these properties. We expect to sign management services and consulting contracts with other, non-affiliated, residential and commercial property owners in the future.

&#160;

Our expansion and growth plans for the future include establishing satellite offices in other counties in Virginia and eventually statewide. We offer exceptional customer service and very competitive pricing, which we believe sets us apart from other property management companies. As we grow, we plan to add additional employees with specific skills to enhance our service offerings. We believe the in-house skill set will enable us to enhance our profitability as we will not have to sub-contract any of our services.

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160;

In April, May and December 2015 and in February 2016, we entered into discussions to provide property management services to six (6) additional properties consisting of a total of three (3) commercial units and fifty eight (58) residential units. All the additional properties under discussion are properties that are owned, in part, by Messer&#8217;s McMillen and Brigante. Four (4) of these properties are located in Warren County, Virginia and two (2) of the properties is located in Fauquier County, Virginia. As of the date of this filing final agreements have not yet been reached.

&#160;

In September 2015, Mr. McMillen, our then President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors resigned his positions of President and Chief Executive Office. Mr. McMillen&#8217;s resignations as an officer of the Company had the effect of removing him for the daily operations of the Company. Mr. McMillen remains the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Also in September 2015, Mr. Brigante, our current Chief Financial Officer, was appointed to the position of President and is the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

&#160;

In January 2016, the Company initiated a private placement (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;) of up to 500,000 units (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) consisting of two (2) shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock and a Common Stock warrant. The Units are priced at $0.50 each and the warrant is exercisable for three (3) years after the subscription date for $0.75. The Company hopes to raise up to $250,000 to investigate the possibility of entering the on-line real estate investment industry. This industry, known to some as real estate crowd funding, has been popularized over the last couple of years and has attracted just afew companies. Management believes this sector is underserved and lacks a regional company to consolidate funding opportunities. Additionally, management believes it can use its property management services to serve properties acquired through on-line funding.

&#160;

Our Services

&#160;

We offer a list of basic services to every client. We price these services based on a percentage of rent, currently at a rate of 10%, for the properties under management. These services include:

&#160;

&#183; advertising the premises for rent, including placing signs on the premises, in newspapers or in real estate publications, &#183; showing the premises to prospective and actual tenants, &#183; signing, renewing, terminating and canceling leases and tenancies on general terms and conditions approved by owners and on such form of lease as we determine to be appropriate, &#183; enforcing lease provisions and collecting rents and other amounts due from tenants and recovering possession of the premises, &#183; signing and serving in the name of the owner notices and instituting and prosecuting actions against tenants, &#183; in our discretion, settling, compromising and releasing claims and actions or reinstating tenancies, &#183; recommending to owners, for their approval, a schedule of rents and fees to tenants, &#183; handling and resolving complaints of tenants, and &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; entering into such contracts regarding the premises as we deem appropriate, including obtaining utility service and hiring employees and contractual labor for owners. &#160;

Additionally, we offer other services to our clients for which we negotiate pricing per service rendered. These services include:

&#160;

&#183; remodeling and repairing leased premises, &#183; providing appraisal services for the property owners, &#183; advertising for sale an owner&#8217;s property and assisting in the sale process, &#183; assisting clients in purchasing new properties, and &#183; providing bookkeeping and tax assistance to clients. &#160;

Our Market

&#160;

We believe the market for property management services for small individual property owners who lack the time or proficiency to manage their own properties in a profitable manner is underserved. Further, we believe this to be especially true for Fauquier County, Virginia and the surrounding counties in Virginia due to the rural geography of the region and the many property owners who rent their properties, both on a residential and commercial basis, as a second source of income. Our services are focused on these specific property owners.

&#160;

With the recent struggles in the sale of real estate in the geography we serve, we have witnessed several property owners revert to renting their property when sales efforts have not been successful. We target these specific property owners who have little or no experience in renting properties as our services are a turnkey solution for them.

&#160;

Our focus has initially been on a small regional footprint in Virginia. However, we believe our services are needed in many locations statewide and nationally. We do not intend to compete with large national property management companies, whose primary focus is on large commercial properties, generally located in urban areas.

&#160;

Our Customers

&#160;

We currently have management services contracts with two customers; Marsh Road LLC and Main Street Heritage LLC, which account for recurring monthly revenue of $730 and $390, respectively. Our general services agreement stipulates that our fees are ten percent (10%) of monthly rental income, due the first of each month. Each of our current contracts started March 1, 2015 and terminate on February 28, 2016 (with automatically renews for the same period of the prior year), unless earlier terminated by written agreement between the property owner and us. The property owner can request additional services in writing such as bookkeeping services, property remodeling, property appraisal and property sales support. The fee for each of these additional services is negotiated with the property owner, based on the amount of our time and costs associated with the requested activity. We will continue to use this model as we expand our business. 

&#160; 

Under our general services agreement, we agree to provide the services described above for the term of the agreement. Our fee for these services is billed on the first day of each month based on the monthly rent collected by us and in some cases we remit to the property owner a net amount of rent, which has been reduced by our fee. 

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

We currently compete locally in Fauquier County, Virginia and will eventually compete on a statewide basis with a variety of companies that offer similar services as ours. Based on our review of advertisements, we believe the majority of these companies engage in real estate sales and offer property management services as an add on to their core business. These companies have had many more years of business experience, have proprietary processes and have greater financial and personnel resources, including marketing and sales organizations. We do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the local or statewide market which we are focused on.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

Our business activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by government agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate businesses. We do not anticipate any detrimental regulations specific to our business activities in the future.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We do not hold any patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property on services or processes relating to our business. We do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Insurance

&#160;

We maintain insurance with respect to our operations in such form, in such amounts and with such insures as is customary in the business which we are engaged. We believe the amount and form of our insurance coverage is sufficient.

&#160;

Seasonality

&#160;

We do not have a seasonal business cycle.

&#160;

Environmental Matters

&#160;

In our operations, we do not store, handle, emit, transport or discharge hazardous materials or waste products. Accordingly, we do not anticipate current or future environment matters that may affect our business.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of February 29, 2016, we employed one executive officer on a full-time basis. We currently use independent contract labor to deliver services to our clients. No employees or contractors are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our employee and contractors to be good.

&#160;

Legal Proceedings

&#160;

There are no pending or threatened lawsuits against us.
