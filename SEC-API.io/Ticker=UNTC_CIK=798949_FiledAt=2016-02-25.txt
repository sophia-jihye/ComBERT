GENERAL 

We were founded in 1963 as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company. Today, in addition to our drilling operations, we have operations in the exploration and production and mid-stream areas. We operate, manage, and analyze our results of operations through our three principal business segments: 

&#8226; 

Oil and Natural Gas &#32;&#8211; carried out by our subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company. This segment explores, develops, acquires, and produces oil and natural gas properties for our own account. 

&#8226; 

Contract Drilling &#32;&#8211; carried out by our subsidiary Unit Drilling Company. This segment contracts to drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for others and for our own account. 

&#8226; 

Mid-Stream &#32;&#8211; carried out by our subsidiary Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries. This segment buys, sells, gathers, processes, and treats natural gas for third parties and for our own account. 

Each of these companies may conduct operations through subsidiaries of their own.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS 

General. We began to develop our exploration and production operations in 1979. Today, our wholly owned subsidiary, Unit Petroleum Company, conducts our exploration and production activities. Our producing oil and natural gas properties, unproved properties, and related assets are in the following locations: 

Division 

Location 

West division 

Western and Southern Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Southern Louisiana, and Mississippi 

East division 

East Texas, Eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Northern Louisiana 

Central division 

Western Oklahoma, Texas Panhandle, and Kansas 

When we are the operator of a property, we generally attempt to use a drilling rig owned by our contract drilling segment, and we use our mid-stream segment to gather our gas if it is economical for us to develop a system in the area.

Description and Location of Our Core Operations 

&#32; West division. In our Wilcox play, located primarily in Polk, Tyler, and Hardin Counties, Texas, we completed 12 operated gross vertical wells (average working interest 90%) in 2015 and three operated gross horizontal wells (average working interest 92%) in 2015. All 15 wells were completed as gas/condensate producers. Annual production in our Wilcox play averaged 77.4 MMcfe per day (11% oil, 31% NGLs, 58% natural gas) which is an increase of approximately 19% as compared to 2014. We averaged 1.4 Unit drilling rigs operating during 2015 and currently plan to use one Unit drilling rig during 2016. We anticipate completing approximately four horizontal Wilcox wells primarily in the first quarter 2016. Additional wells may be drilled later in the year depending on commodity prices. In addition, we plan to complete approximately eight to 10 behind pipe gas and liquids zones located primarily in the Wilcox Gilly Field. 

Central division. SOHOT (Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend) is a play located primarily in Grady County, Oklahoma that we first drilled in 2013. The producing horizon is named the Hoxbar which is an interval that contains several potential oil and gas sands which are generally 50 to 100 feet thick. During 2015, we completed 15 Hoxbar horizontal wells focused primarily on two Hoxbar benches named the Marchand oil zone and the Medrano gas liquids zone. Five of the wells were completed in the Hoxbar &#8220;Marchand&#8221; zone and 10 wells were completed in the Hoxbar &#8220;Medrano&#8221; zone. Production during the fourth quarter 2015 averaged 2,047 barrels of oil per day, 1,529 barrels of NGLs per day, and 22.1 MMcf of natural gas per day, which is a 117% increase over the fourth quarter 2014. The average working interest for the 15 wells is 86%. During 2015, we averaged approximately 1.7 Unit drilling rigs in SOHOT. For 2016, our current plan is to drill with one drilling rig through the end of the first quarter at which time we will release the drilling rig. Additional wells may be drilled later in the year depending on commodity prices. 

In the Texas Panhandle District, which consists primarily of Granite Wash (GW) wells, daily production for 2015 averaged approximately 167 MMcfe per day (13% oil, 38% NGLs) which is an increase of 5% over 2014. We had first sales on nine horizontal GW wells, primarily in the first quarter of 2015 having an average working interest of 73%. For 2015, we 

averaged 0.3 Unit drilling rigs in the GW. For 2016, we anticipate drilling one horizontal well during the first quarter. Additional wells may be drilled later in the year depending on commodity prices. 

In our Mississippian play in south central Kansas, the average daily production for 2015 was approximately 1,885 Boe per day (64% oil and 12% NGLs) which is an increase of 23% as compared to 2014. We had first sales on three operated horizontal Mississippian wells during the first quarter 2015 with a 100% average working interest. During 2015, we averaged 0.4 Unit drilling rigs in the Mississippian play. One or two Mississippian wells may be drilled in late 2016 depending on commodity prices. 

In the Marmaton horizontal oil play in Beaver County, Oklahoma, we had first sales on three horizontal wells during the first quarter of 2015 with an average working interest of 70%. The daily average production rate for 2015 was approximately 2,500 Boe per day (57% oil and 16% NGLs) which is a decrease of 37% as compared to 2014. We do not anticipate drilling any new wells in the play during 2016. 

East division. Over the last several years, activity in our East division has been limited due to low gas prices since this area does not generally have oil or NGLs associated with the gas. 

Dispositions. In August 2013, we sold some of our Bakken property interests. The proceeds, net of related expenses, were $57.1 million. In addition, we had other non-core asset sales with proceeds, net of related expenses, of $21.7 million, $33.1 million, and $1.9 million for 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Proceeds from these dispositions reduced the net book value of our full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized. 

We determined the value of certain unproved oil and gas properties were diminished (in part or in whole) based on an impairment evaluation and our anticipated future exploration plans. Those determinations resulted in $73.7 million &#32;(in 2014) and $114.4 million &#32;(in 2015) of costs being added to the total of our capitalized costs being amortized. We incurred a $76.7 million &#32;pre-tax ( $47.7 million &#32;net of tax) non-cash ceiling test write-down of our oil and natural gas properties in 2014. In 2015, we incurred non-cash ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties of $1.6 billion &#32;pre-tax ( $1.0 billion &#32;net of tax) in 2015 due to the inclusion of the impaired value of those unproved properties and a reduction of the 12-month average commodity prices during the year.

Approximately 69% (West &#8211; 57%; East &#8211; 88%; and Central &#8211; 78%) of the net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that will expire in the years 2016&#8212;2018 unless drilling or production extends the terms of those leases. Currently, we do not have any material proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves attributable to acreage where the expiration date precedes the scheduled PUD reserve development plan.

Oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Estimates of those reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. We use Ryder Scott Company L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum consultants, to audit the reserves prepared by our reservoir engineers. Ryder Scott has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1937. Their summary report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The wells or locations for which reserve estimates were audited were taken from reserve and income projections prepared by us as of December 31, 2015 and comprised 79% &#32;of the total proved developed discounted future net income and 81% &#32;of the total proved discounted future net income (based on the SEC's unescalated pricing policy). 

Our Reservoir Engineering department is responsible for reserve determination for the wells in which we have an interest. Their primary objective is to estimate the wells' future reserves and future net value to us. Data is incorporated from multiple sources including geological, production engineering, marketing, production, land, and accounting departments. The engineers are responsible for reviewing this information for accuracy as it is incorporated into the reservoir engineering database. Our internal audit group reviews the controls to help provide assurance all the data has been provided. New well reserve estimates are provided to management as well as the respective operational divisions for additional scrutiny. Major reserve changes on existing wells are reviewed on a regular basis with the operational divisions to confirm correctness and accuracy. As the external audit is being completed by Ryder Scott, the reservoir department performs a final review of all properties for accuracy of forecasting. 

Technical Qualifications 

Ryder Scott &#8211; Mr. Robert J. Paradiso was the primary technical person responsible for overseeing the estimate of the reserves, future production and income prepared by Ryder Scott. 

Mr. Paradiso, an employee of Ryder Scott since 2008, is a Vice President and also serves as Project Coordinator, responsible for coordinating and supervising staff and consulting engineers in ongoing reservoir evaluation studies worldwide. Before joining Ryder Scott, Mr. Paradiso served in a number of engineering positions with Getty Oil Company, Texaco, Union Texas Petroleum, Amax Oil and Gas, Inc., Norcen Explorer, Inc., Amerac Energy Corporation, Halliburton Energy Services, Santa Fe Snyder Corp., and Devon Energy Corporation. 

Mr. Paradiso earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas Tech University in 1979, and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). 

In addition to gaining experience and competency through prior work experience, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers requires a minimum of fifteen hours of continuing education annually, including at least one hour in the area of professional ethics, which Mr. Paradiso fulfills. As part of his 2015 continuing education hours, Mr. Paradiso attended 2 hours of formalized training during the 2015 RSC Reserves Conference relating to the definitions and disclosure guidelines contained in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register. Mr. Paradiso attended an additional 31.5 hours of formalized in-house training during 2015 covering such topics as the SPE/WPC/AAPG/SPEE Petroleum Resources Management System, reservoir engineering, geoscience and petroleum economics evaluation methods, procedures and software and ethics for consultants. 

Based on his educational background, professional training and more than 36 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves, Mr. Paradiso has attained the professional qualifications as a Reserves Estimator and Reserves Auditor set forth in Article III of the &#8220;Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information&#8221; promulgated by the SPE as of February 19, 2007. For more information regarding Mr. Paradiso&#8217;s geographic and job specific experience, please refer to the Ryder Scott Company website at http://www.ryderscott.com/Company/Employees. 

The Company &#8211; &#32;Responsibility for overseeing the preparation of our reserve report is shared by our reservoir engineers Trenton Mitchell and David Morrill. 

Mr. Mitchell earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&#38;M University in 1994. He has been an employee of Unit since 2002. Initially, he was the Outside Operated Engineer and since 2003 he has served in the capacity of Reservoir Engineer and in 2010 he was promoted to Manager of Reservoir Engineering. Before joining Unit, he served in a number of engineering field and technical support positions with Schlumberger Well Services in their pumping services segment (formerly Dowell Schlumberger). He obtained his Professional Engineer registration from the State of Oklahoma in 2004 and has been a member of SPE since 1991. 

Mr. Morrill received a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Gas Engineering from Texas A&#38;I University in 1970 and has spent 35 of his 40 years in the industry directly involved in reserve evaluation and appraisals, acquisitions, prospect reviews, and field studies. Included in this time were eight years working for the petroleum consulting firm Keplinger and Associates. He joined Unit in 2006 and since that time has shared responsibility for preparation of the company's reserve report. Mr. Morrill is a registered professional engineer in the State of Oklahoma and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) and SPE. 

As part of the continuing education requirement for maintaining their professional licenses Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Morrill have attended various seminars and forums to enhance their understanding of current standards and issues for reserves presentation. These forums have included those sponsored by various professional societies and professional service firms including Ryder Scott. 

Definitions and Other. Proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves, as defined in SEC Rule 4-10(a), are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible &#8211; from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations &#8211; before the time the contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: 

&#8226; 

The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 

&#8226; 

Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geosciences and engineering data. 

In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geosciences, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geosciences, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

&#8226; 

Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole; 

&#8226; 

The operation of an installed program in the reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

&#8226; 

The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the average of the prices over the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by the report, and is determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. 

Proved undeveloped oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. Under no circumstances can estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 65 &#32;gross proved undeveloped wells all of which we plan to develop within five years of initial disclosure at a net estimated cost of approximately $156.8 million . The future estimated development costs necessary to develop our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves in the United States for the years 2016&#8212;2020, as disclosed in our December 31, 2015 &#32;oil and natural gas reserve report, are shown below: &#32;

During 2015, we converted 19 &#32;proved undeveloped wells into proved developed wells at a cost of approximately $58.6 million . The downward revision to previous estimates were due to a number of factors including the removal of PUDs that are not part of our five-year development plan due to the decline in prices causing them to be uneconomic to drill and also due to a reduction in anticipated future capital expenditures. 

Our estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the changes in quantities, and standardized measure of those reserves for the three years then ended, are shown in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures included in Item 8 of this report. 

Contracts. Our oil production is sold at or near our wells under purchase contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements customary in the oil industry. Our natural gas production is sold to intrastate and interstate pipelines as well as to independent marketing firms under contracts with terms generally ranging from one month to a year. Few of these contracts contain provisions for readjustment of price as most of them are market sensitive. 

Customers. During 2015 , sales to Sunoco Logistics and Valero Energy Corporation accounted for 19% &#32;and 15% &#32;of our oil and natural gas revenues, respectively. There was no other company that accounted for more than 10% of our oil and natural gas revenues. During 2015 , our mid-stream segment purchased $57.6 million &#32;of our natural gas and NGLs production and provided gathering and transportation services of $7.6 million . Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between our mid-stream segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we eliminated intercompany revenues of $89.6 million &#32;and $91.0 million , respectively, attributable to the intercompany purchase of our production of natural gas and NGLs as well as gathering and transportation services. 

CONTRACT DRILLING 

General. Our contract drilling business is conducted through Unit Drilling Company. Through this company we drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for our own account as well as other oil and natural gas companies. Our drilling operations are located in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Kansas, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Until October 31, 2015, our drilling operations in Texas was conducted under Unit Drilling Texas, a subsidiary of Unit Drilling Company. Effective October 31, 2015, that subsidiary was merged into Unit Drilling Company.

Description and Location of Our Drilling Rigs. An on-shore drilling rig is composed of major equipment components like engines, drawworks or hoists, derrick or mast, substructure, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, and drill pipe. As a result of the normal wear and tear from operating 24 hours a day, several of the major components, like engines, mud pumps, and drill pipe, must be replaced or rebuilt on a periodic basis. Other major components, like the substructure, mast, and drawworks, can be used for extended periods of time with proper maintenance. We also own additional equipment used in the operation of our drilling rigs, including top drives, iron roughnecks, automated catwalks, skidding systems, large air compressors, trucks, and other support equipment. 

The maximum depth capacities of our various drilling rigs range from 9,500 to 40,000 feet to cover a wide range of our customers drilling requirements. In 2015 , 81 &#32;of our 94 &#32;drilling rigs were used in drilling services.

In 2016, these divisions will be consolidated into the Mid-Continent division. 

The cyclical nature of the drilling business is best reflected in drilling rig utilization rates. Drilling rig utilization was relatively flat throughout 2013 averaging 65 drilling rigs operating for the year. Then 2014 saw an increase of 17 drilling rigs running - going from 65 drilling rigs at the start of the year to 82 drilling rigs in November. The last month of 2014 reflects the beginning of the current downward market trend with a precipitous decline of 50 drilling rigs through the end of the first quarter of 2015 where we slowed to 31 operating drilling rigs. This level of utilization continued through August with the weakening of commodity prices through the end of the year. At the end of 2015, our active drilling rig count was 26. 

Mid-Continent, Woodward, and Panhandle. We have long held a strong position and market presence in the mid-continent area of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. This area is commonly referred to as the Anadarko Basin, which also encompasses portions of Kansas. Historically, the Anadarko Basin has been known as a gas producing area, but it is also rich in oil and NGLs production. During the last several years operators have focused their operations in this basin on the Cana Woodford, Granite Wash, Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend (SOHOT), Cleveland, Tonkawa, Marmaton, and Mississippian 

horizontal plays. Typically, three of our divisions work in this basin. During 2015, our Mid-Continent and Panhandle divisions averaged 14.2 and 4.1 drilling rigs operating, respectively. We have consolidated our Woodward division into the Panhandle division with the decline of drilling rig activity in this current market. At the end of 2015, these two divisions had 11 drilling rigs operating in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Additionally, two Mid-Continent drilling rigs were operating in the Permian Basin at the end of year. 

Gulf Coast. Our Gulf Coast division provides drilling rigs to the onshore areas of Texas and Louisiana. During 2015, the Gulf Coast division averaged 4.0 drilling rigs operating. The Gulf Coast had one drilling rig working in East Texas and two drilling rigs operating in the Permian Basin at the end of 2015. 

Rocky Mountains. Our Rocky Mountain division covers several states, including Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota. This vast area has produced a number of conventional and unconventional oil and gas fields. This division operated an average of 10.0 drilling rigs during 2015. We had four drilling rigs operating in the Pinedale Anticline of western Wyoming, four drilling rigs operating in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota, and two drilling rigs operating in the Niobrara play of eastern Colorado at the end of 2015. 

In 2016, due to the current market conditions, we will further consolidate the divisions. Our Panhandle and Gulf Coast divisions will be consolidated into the Mid-Continent. We will then have two divisions, Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain. 

At any given time the number of drilling rigs we can work depends on a number of conditions besides demand, including the availability of qualified labor and the availability of needed drilling supplies and equipment. The impact of these conditions tends to affect the demand for our drilling rigs. Our average utilization rate for 2015, 2014, and 2013 was 38%, 63%, and 52%, respectively.

During 2015, we sold 31 drilling rigs previously removed from service in December 2014. 

Dispositions, Acquisitions, and Construction. During 2013, we sold four of our 2,000 horsepower electric drilling rigs and one 3,000 horsepower electric drilling rigs. All of these sales were to unaffiliated third-parties. 

During the first quarter of 2014. we sold four additional idle 3,000 horsepower drilling rigs to an unaffiliated third party. The proceeds from that sale were used in our construction program for our new proprietary 1,500 horsepower, AC electric drilling rig, called the BOSS drilling rig. 

During 2014, three BOSS drilling rigs were constructed and placed into service for third-party operators. 

In December 2014, we removed from service 31 drilling rigs, some older top drives, and certain drill pipe no longer marketable in the current environment and based on the estimated market value from third-party assessments, we recorded a write-down of approximately $74.3 million , pre-tax. During the first quarter of 2015, we sold one of these drilling rigs to an unaffiliated third party. The proceeds of this sale, less costs to sell, exceeded the $0.3 million net book value of the drilling rig 

resulting in a gain of $7,900. During the second quarter, we recorded an additional write-down on the remaining drilling rigs and other equipment of approximately $8.3 million pre-tax based on the estimated market value from similar auctions. During the third quarter, we sold the remaining 30 drilling rigs and most of the equipment in an auction. The proceeds from the sale of those assets, less costs to sell, was less than the $11.0 million net book value resulting in a loss of $7.3 million pre-tax. Some of the equipment that was not sold at the auction will be sold within the next twelve months and remain classified as assets held for sale. The net book value of those assets is $0.6 million . 

During the first half of 2015, five BOSS drilling rigs were constructed and placed into service for third-party operators. The long lead time components for three additional BOSS drilling rigs were ordered in 2014 in anticipation for future demand of the BOSS drilling rigs. However, with the decline in the demand in the drilling market, many of these long lead time components were either postponed for later delivery or canceled altogether. Currently, we do not have any contracts to build new BOSS drilling rigs. 

Drilling Contracts. Our drilling contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding on a well by well basis. Contract terms and payment rates vary depending on the type of contract used, the duration of the work, the equipment and services supplied, and other matters. We pay certain operating expenses, including the wages of our drilling rig personnel, maintenance expenses, and incidental drilling rig supplies and equipment. The contracts are usually subject to early termination by the customer subject to the payment of a fee. Our contracts also contain provisions regarding indemnification against certain types of claims involving injury to persons, property, and for acts of pollution. The specific terms of these indemnifications are subject to negotiation on a contract by contract basis. 

The type of contract used determines our compensation. Contracts are generally one of three types: daywork; footage; or turnkey. Under a daywork contract, we provide the drilling rig with the required personnel and the operator supervises the drilling of the well. Our compensation is based on a negotiated rate to be paid for each day the drilling rig is used. Footage contracts usually require us to bear some of the drilling costs in addition to providing the drilling rig. We are paid on completion of the well at a negotiated rate for each foot drilled. Under turnkey contracts we drill the well to a specified depth for a set amount and provide most of the required equipment and services. We bear the risk of drilling the well to the contract depth and are paid when the contract provisions are completed. We may incur losses if we underestimate the costs to drill the well or if unforeseen events occur that increase our costs or result in the loss of the well. We did not have any footage or turnkey contracts in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 . Because market demand for our drilling rigs as well as the desires of our customers determine the types of contracts we use, we cannot predict when and if a part of our drilling will be conducted under footage or turnkey contracts. 

The majority of our contracts are on a well-to-well basis, with the rest under term contracts. Term contracts range from six months to three years and the rates can either be fixed throughout the term or allow for periodic adjustments. 

Customers. During 2015 , QEP Resources, Inc. was our largest drilling customer accounting for approximately 25% &#32;of our total contract drilling revenues. Our work for this customer was under multiple contracts and our business was not substantially dependent on any of these individual contracts. Consequently, none of these individual contracts were considered to be material. No other third party customer accounted for 10% or more of our contract drilling revenues. 

Our contract drilling segment also provides drilling services for our oil and natural gas segment. During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , our contract drilling segment drilled 38 , 134 , and 105 &#32;wells, respectively, for our oil and natural gas segment, or 7% , 15% , and 13% , respectively, of the total wells drilled by our contract drilling segment. Depending on the timing of the drilling services performed on our properties those services may be deemed, for financial reporting purposes, to be associated with the acquisition of an ownership interest in the property. Revenues and expenses for these services are eliminated in our statement of operations, with any profit recognized reducing our investment in our oil and natural gas properties. The contracts for these services are issued under the similar terms and rates as the contracts entered into with unrelated third parties. By providing drilling services for the oil and natural gas segment, we eliminated revenue of $22.1 million , $89.5 million , and $64.3 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, from our contract drilling segment and eliminated the associated operating expense of $18.3 million , $62.4 million , and $46.9 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, yielding $3.8 million , $27.1 million , and $17.4 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, as a reduction to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. 

MID-STREAM 

General. Our mid-stream operations are conducted through Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries. Its operations consist of buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating natural gas. It operates three &#32;natural gas treatment plants, 13 &#32;processing plants, 25 &#32;active gathering systems, and approximately 1,464 &#32;miles of pipeline. Superior and its subsidiaries operate in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

Dispositions and Acquisitions. This segment did not have any significant dispositions or acquisitions during 2013, 2014, or 2015. 

In 2014, our mid-stream segment had a $7.1 million pre-tax write-down of three of its systems, Weatherford, Billy Rose, and Spring Creek and in 2015, incurred a $27.0 million &#32;pre-tax write-down of its systems, Bruceton Mills, Spring Creek, and Midwell due to anticipated future cash flow and future development around these systems not being sufficient to support their carrying value. The estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value on these systems. 

Contracts. Our mid-stream segment provides its customers with a full range of gathering, processing, and treating services. These services are usually provided to each customer under long-term contracts (more than one year), but we do have some short-term contracts as well. Our customer agreements include the following types of contracts: 

&#8226; 

Fee-Based Contracts. These contracts provide for a set fee for gathering, transporting, compressing, and treating services. Our mid-stream&#8217;s revenue is a function of the volume of natural gas and is not directly dependent on the value of the natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 68% &#32;of our mid-stream segment&#8217;s total volumes and 65% &#32;of its operating margins (as defined below) were under fee-based contracts. 

&#8226; 

Commodity-Based Contracts. These contracts consist of several contract structure types. Under these contract structures, our mid-stream segment purchases the raw well-head natural gas and settles with the producer at a stipulated price while retaining all sales proceeds from third parties or retains a negotiated percentage of the sales proceeds from the residue natural gas and NGLs it gathers and processes, with the remainder being paid to the producer. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 32% &#32;of our mid-stream segment&#8217;s total volumes and 35% &#32;of operating margins (as defined below) were under commodity-cased contracts. 

For each of the above contracts, operating margin is defined as total operating revenues less operating expenses and does not include depreciation, amortization, and impairment, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, or income taxes. 

Customers. During 2015 , ONEOK Partners, L.P. , Tenaska Resources, LLC , and Laclede Group, Inc. &#32;accounted for approximately 29% , 18% , and 12% , respectively, of our mid-stream revenues. We believe that if we lost any of these identified customers, there are other customers available to purchase our gas and NGLs. During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;this segment purchased $57.6 million , $80.9 million , and $83.0 million , respectively, of our oil and natural gas segment's natural gas and NGLs production, and provided gathering and transportation services of $7.6 million , $8.7 million , and $8.0 million , respectively. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between this business segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 

VOLATILE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS 

The prevailing prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas significantly affect our revenues, operating results, cash flow as well as our ability to grow our operations. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices have been volatile and we expect them to continue to be so. For each of the periods indicated, the following table shows the highest and lowest average prices our oil and natural gas segment received for its sales of oil, NGLs, and natural gas without taking into account the effect of derivatives:

Prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the actual or perceived supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including: 

&#8226; 

political conditions in oil producing regions; 

&#8226; 

the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on prices and their ability or willingness to maintain production quotas; 

&#8226; 

actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; 

&#8226; 

the price of foreign oil imports; 

&#8226; 

imports and exports of oil and liquefied natural gas; 

&#8226; 

actions of governmental authorities; 

&#8226; 

the domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas; 

&#8226; 

the level of consumer demand; 

&#8226; 

United States storage levels of oil, NGLs, and natural gas; 

&#8226; 

weather conditions; 

&#8226; 

domestic and foreign government regulations; 

&#8226; 

the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels; 

&#8226; 

volatility in ethane prices causing rejection of ethane as part of the liquids processed stream; and 

&#8226; 

worldwide economic conditions. 

These factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas. Prices after 2015 year-end have declined below the price at December 31, 2015. You are encouraged to read the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of this report for additional risks that can impact our operations. 

Our contract drilling operations are dependent on the level of demand in our operating markets. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices affect demand. Because oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are volatile, the level of demand for our services can also be volatile. 

Our mid-stream operations provide us greater flexibility in delivering our (and third parties) natural gas and NGLs from the wellhead to major natural gas and NGLs pipelines. Margins received for the delivery of these natural gas and NGLs are dependent on the price for oil, NGLs, and natural gas and the demand for natural gas and NGLs in our area of operations. If the price of NGLs falls without a corresponding decrease in the cost of natural gas, it may become uneconomical to us to extract certain NGLs. The volumes of natural gas and NGLs processed are highly dependent on the volume and Btu content of the natural gas and NGLs gathered. 

COMPETITION 

All of our businesses are highly competitive and price sensitive. Competition in the contract drilling business traditionally involves factors such as demand, price, efficiency, condition of equipment, availability of labor and equipment, reputation, and customer relations. 

Our oil and natural gas operations likewise encounter strong competition from other oil and natural gas companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and have more experience than we do in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. 

Our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, during times of increased competition on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for these professionals can, at times, be extremely intense. 

Our mid-stream segment competes with purchasers and gatherers of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies, as well as independent gatherers for the right to purchase natural gas and NGLs, build gathering and processing systems, and deliver the natural gas and NGLs once the gathering and processing systems are established. The principal elements of competition include the rates, terms, and availability of services, reputation, and the flexibility and reliability of service. 

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROGRAMS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

Unit Petroleum Company serves as the general partner of 15 &#32;oil and gas limited partnerships. Two &#32;were formed for investment by third parties and 13 &#32;(the employee partnerships) were formed to allow certain of our qualified employees and our directors to participate in Unit Petroleum&#8217;s oil and gas exploration and production operations. The non-employee partnerships were formed in 1984 and two in 1986. Effective December 31, 2014, the 1984 partnership was dissolved. Employee partnerships were formed for each year beginning with 1984 and ending with 2011. 

The employee partnerships formed in 1984 through 1999 have been combined into a single consolidated partnership. The employee partnerships each have a set annual percentage (ranging from 1% to 15%) of our interest that the partnership acquires in most of the oil and natural gas wells we drill or acquire for our own account during the year in which the partnership was formed. The total interest the participants have in our oil and natural gas wells by participating in these partnerships does not exceed one percent of our interest in the wells. 

Under the terms of our partnership agreements, the general partner has broad discretionary authority to manage the business and operations of the partnership, including the authority to make decisions regarding the partnership&#8217;s participation in a drilling location or a property acquisition, the partnership&#8217;s expenditure of funds, and the distribution of funds to partners. Because the business activities of the limited partners and the general partner are not the same, conflicts of interest will exist and it is not possible to entirely eliminate these conflicts. Additionally, conflicts of interest may arise when we are the operator of an oil and natural gas well and also provide contract drilling services. In these cases, the drilling operations are conducted under drilling contracts containing terms and conditions comparable to those contained in our drilling contracts with non-affiliated operators. We believe we fulfill our responsibility to each contracting party and comply fully with the terms of the agreements which regulate these conflicts. 

These partnerships are further described in Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of February 12, 2016 , we had approximately 671 &#32;employees in our contract drilling segment, 290 &#32;employees in our oil and natural gas segment, 140 &#32;employees in our mid-stream segment, and 78 &#32;in our general corporate area. None of our employees are members of a union or labor organization nor have our operations ever been interrupted by a strike or work stoppage. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS 

General. &#32;Our business depends on the demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, and therefore our business can be affected by political developments and changes in laws and regulations that control or curtail drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, or other policy reasons. 

Various state and federal regulations affect the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states in which we conduct activities impose varying restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas. The following discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting our operations should not be relied upon as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting us, due to the multitude of complex federal, state, and local regulations, and their susceptibility to change by subsequent agency actions and court rulings, that may affect our operations. 

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in &#8220;first sales&#8221; in interstate and intrastate commerce. Effective January 1, 1993, however, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the Decontrol Act) deregulated natural gas prices for all &#8220;first sales&#8221; of natural gas. Because &#8220;first sales&#8221; include typical wellhead sales by producers, all natural gas produced from our natural gas properties is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect. FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation is not affected by the Decontrol Act. 

Our sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Beginning in 1985, FERC adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes are intended by FERC to foster competition by, among other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of gas transporters. All natural gas marketing by the pipelines is required to divest to a marketing affiliate, which operates separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants. As a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late 1980s and the subsequent individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid-1990s, interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to all producers, natural gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users, and other customers seeking service. Through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services, FERC expanded the impact of open access regulations to certain aspects of intrastate commerce. 

FERC has pursued other policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services upon the pipeline&#8217;s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. 

As a result of these changes, independent sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counter parties. We believe these changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while, at the same time, substantially increasing 

competition in the natural gas marketplace. However, we cannot predict what new or different regulations FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on production and marketing of natural gas from our properties. 

Although in the past Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation as discussed above, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation and the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry. Thus, in addition to &#8220;first sales&#8221; deregulation, Congress also repealed incremental pricing requirements and natural gas use restraints previously applicable. There continually are legislative proposals pending in the Federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, these proposals might have on the production and marketing of natural gas by us. Similarly, and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on the production and marketing of natural gas by us cannot be predicted. 

Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Sales and Transportation. Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are at market prices. The prices received from the sale of these products are affected by the cost of transporting these products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments could result in decreased rates in a given year. These regulations have generally been approved on judicial review. Every five years, FERC examines the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry and makes any necessary adjustment in the index to be used during the ensuing five years. We are not able to predict with certainty what effect, if any, the periodic review of the index by FERC will have on us. 

Exploration and Production Activities. Federal, state, and local agencies also have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. The states we operate in require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and the filing of reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and, abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. 

Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws. 

Environmental. 

General. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may require acquisition of permits before certain of our operations may be commenced and may restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment. Planning and implementation of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids, and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are subject to regulatory requirements. 

The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and their state counterparts, are the primary vehicles for imposition of such requirements and for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. In addition, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of remedial action as well as damages to natural resources. 

The EPA in 2015 established publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) effluent guidelines and standards for oil and gas extraction facilities which reflected current industry best practices for unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. 

The EPA and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers in 2015 proposed a new definition of the &#8220;waters of the United States,&#8221; which rules has been stayed by courts pending conformity with the definition U.S. Supreme Court previously established. 

Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act, referred to as the &#8220;ESA,&#8221; and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators and service companies to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas. All three of our business segments could be subject to the effect of one or more species being listed as threatened or endangered within the areas of our operations. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future undertake operations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries in 2016 issued final revised definitions relating to impacts on critical habitats for potentially endangered species allowing exclusion of certain areas so long as they will not result in the extinction of the species. The presence of protected species in areas where we provide contract drilling or mid-stream services or conduct exploration and production operations could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those services and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 

Climate Change. &#32; Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; or GHGs, may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. As a result there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements, and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States (as well as other parts of the World) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. 

In 2007, the United States Supreme Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA , held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an &#8220;air pollutant&#8221; under the federal Clean Air Act if it represents a health hazard to the public. On December 7, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA &#32;decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain GHGs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of GHG and hence to the threat of climate change. In addition, the EPA issued a final rule, effective in December 2009, requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large (25,000 metric tons or more) GHG emission sources in the U.S., beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. During 2010, the EPA proposed revisions to these reporting requirements to apply to all oil and gas production, transmission, processing, and other facilities exceeding certain emission thresholds. In September and November 2013, the EPA proposed further revisions to record keeping and reporting requirements, which have not yet been finalized. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the crude oil we gather, transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our services. In addition, both President Obama and the Administrator of the EPA have repeatedly indicated their preference for comprehensive legislation to address this issue and create the framework for a clean energy economy, with the Obama Administration supporting an emission allowance system. Past proposed legislation in Congress has included an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Some states are also looking at similar types of laws and regulations. 

The EPA in 2015 proposed rules to reduce methane and ozone-forming VOC emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector. 

Hydraulic Fracturing. Our oil and natural gas segment routinely applies hydraulic-fracturing techniques to many of our oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Marmaton of Oklahoma, the Wilcox of Texas, and the Mississippian of Kansas. The EPA is studying the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including the impact on drinking water sources and public health, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has been conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. The U.S. House of Representatives has previously passed a bill that would block the Department of Interior from regulating hydraulic fracturing in states that already have their own regulations in place; however, it is uncertain that such an act will ever be enacted and if enacted, it would likely be subject to a Presidential veto. In addition, certain states in which we operate, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming have adopted, and other states as well as municipalities and other local governmental entities in some states, have and others are considering adopting regulations and ordinances that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure of fracking fluids, waste disposal, and well construction requirements on these operations, and even restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in 

certain circumstances. Any new laws, regulation, or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to operational delay, or increased operating costs or third party or governmental claims, and could result in additional burdens that could serve to delay or limit the drilling services we provide to third parties whose drilling operations could be impacted by these regulations or increase our costs of compliance and doing business as well as delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. 

Other; Compliance Costs. We cannot predict future legislation or regulations It is possible that such future laws, regulations, and/or ordinances could result in increasing our compliance costs or additional operating restrictions as well as those of our customers. It is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels which could adversely affect the demand for our services, which in turn could adversely affect our future results of operations. Likewise we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change (or otherwise) will have a material impact on our operations. 

Compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not, to date, had a material effect on the cost of our operations, earnings, or competitive position. However, as noted above in connection with our discussion of the regulation of GHGs and hydraulic fracturing, compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 

Historically, our revenues from our Canadian operations, as well as information relating to long-lived assets attributable to those operations were immaterial. We no longer have any interests there or any other international operations.
