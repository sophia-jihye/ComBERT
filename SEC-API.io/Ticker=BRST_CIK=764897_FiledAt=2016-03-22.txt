Overview 

&#160;

Banyan is a shell company without significant operations. Our management team is aggressively investigating potential operating companies to acquire and additional sources of financing. Currently we are actively seeking acquisitions of leading companies within the industrial, energy, transportation, technology and health care industries throughout North America, but we cannot guarantee we will complete an acquisition in any of these industries. Accordingly, we may explore potential acquisitions in other industries as well.

&#160;

In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire the business of International Thermocast Corporation, a manufacturer and distributor of composite kitchen and bath sinks and accessories including cast acrylic and granite sinks, cultured and synthetic marble vanity tops and other related goods and services. For more information concerning the acquisition, please see Note 10, Subsequent Events, to our Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Our History 

&#160;

The Company was originally organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1985, for the purpose of investing in mortgage loans. The Company was reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. From 1989 to 1992 the Company experienced severe losses as a result of a decline in real estate values and the resulting defaults on the mortgages it held. In 1998, the Company changed its name to B.H.I.T. Inc., and again changed its name to Banyan Rail Services Inc. in 2010. From 2009 to 2012, the Company operated and experienced severe losses from an operating subsidiary in the rail services sector and is now a shell company.
