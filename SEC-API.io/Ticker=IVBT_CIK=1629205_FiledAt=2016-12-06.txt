 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

We intend to provide our customers with a software program to manage and aggregate individual cloud storage services that will appear and act as one large drive to the user. The user need not know or care where or how their data is distributed across multiple storage platforms, but can rest assured there data will be safe and secure. Other features intended to be included in the MCI program is the encryption of all data prior to uploading to the cloud and no restriction on file size as many current providers do.

&#160;

Currently, MCI has identified 5 service providers whose aggregated free cloud storage could provide a MCI user with 57 gigabytes of free cloud storage to be managed by the MCI application, intended to be available for $9.99.

&#160;

MCI intends to develop and deliver a computer software program for Windows, MAC, OSI and Android systems that will allow its customers to aggregate and manage multiple cloud storage accounts as one. Using the application, the user may sign up for multiple free or paid for cloud storage accounts from cloud storage providers such as Microsoft, Apple, Dropbox and others. Users of our application could sign up for as much as 57 gigabytes of free cloud storage using multiple services but have them treated as one single drive on their desktop or mobile device. Our application will sell for $9.99 and be available from our website, the App Store and Google&#8217;s store. Not only will our application manage and consolidate multiple cloud storage accounts, but it will also offer a higher level of security than is currently available, in that most cloud storage providers encrypt user files once they reach the cloud but transfer those files across the Internet unencrypted. The MCI application will encrypt a user&#8217;s file on the local device prior to uploading it to the Cloud.

&#160;

My Cloudz, Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the Company is no longer considered a shell company.

&#160;

There is the likelihood that we may never be able to develop and market our proposed software program in order to successfully complete and implement our plan of operation. If our company is not capable of building a market for its product, all funds that we spend on development will be lost.

&#160;

Market/Competition Analysis 

&#160;

MCI intends to provide users with a software program that will aggregate and mange secure online storage in the cloud utilizing multiple accounts with individual cloud storage providers. The end result will appear and act as one large drive to the user. One of the biggest concerns to users of cloud storage is the security of the data stored in the cloud. In addition to seemlessly aggregating multiple cloud accounts for ease of access by users, we intend for our proposed product to have some of the highest security features available. These will include:

&#160;

&#160;

1. Online backup services that will be protected by the highest levels of encryption algorithms as well as ghosting and spoofing techniques of Intent IP addresses making it virtually impossible to track; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

2. Multiple passwords allowing various layers of access to a limited amount of data; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

3. A military-grade data purge feature of all data assosicate with a particular login if the same login is used with another password; and, &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

4. The opportunity to dispatch help, such as local law enforcement, should someone be forced to reveal sensitive data against their will. For example, a password could give access to non-critical data but at the same time that password would cause the system to dispatch law enfforcement to a specific location. 

&#160;

At the present time, we know of no other commercially software that provides all of the features and services that our proposed product will be designed to provide.
