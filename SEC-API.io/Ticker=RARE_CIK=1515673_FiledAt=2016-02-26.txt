 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. We target diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no currently approved therapies. Since our inception in 2010, we have in-licensed potential treatments for multiple rare genetic disorders. Our strategy, which is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, allows us to pursue multiple programs in parallel with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency. 

Our current product candidate pipeline has been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Our strategy is to acquire and retain global commercialization rights to our products to maximize long-term value, where possible. Over time, we intend to build our own commercial organization, which we believe will be highly targeted due to the relatively small number of specialists who treat patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases. At this time, however, we have no products that are approved for sale.

The patients we seek to treat have diseases with limited or no treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are dependent upon our efforts to develop new therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about developing these therapies with the utmost urgency and care. 

We were founded in April 2010 by our current President and Chief Executive Officer, Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., who is the former Chief Medical Officer of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. We have assembled an experienced team with extensive rare disease drug development and commercialization capabilities. Dr. Kakkis and the team at Ultragenyx have been previously involved at other companies in the development and/or commercialization of many therapies approved or in development for rare genetic diseases. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases in the United States, the European Union, or EU, and select international markets, with the goal of becoming a leading rare disease biotechnology company. The critical components of our business strategy include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on rare and ultra-rare diseases with significant unmet medical need and clear biology. There are numerous rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases that currently have no approved drug therapy and for which no therapies are currently in development. Patients suffering from these diseases often have a high unmet medical need with significant morbidity and/or mortality. We are focused on developing and commercializing therapies for multiple such indications with the utmost urgency. We also focus on diseases that have biology that is well understood. For example, several of our product candidates are replacement therapies for a single deficient enzyme or substrate in the body. We believe that developing drugs that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our experience and relationships to in-license promising product candidates. Our management team has strong relationships with key opinion leaders in the genetic field, as well as a history of success in the development and commercialization of therapies for rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. Accordingly, we enjoy unique access to many in-licensing opportunities. All of our current clinical product candidates are in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. We believe these parties have agreed to license product candidates to us because they are confident in our team&#8217;s drug development capabilities and experience in bringing rare disease therapies to market. Because we typically in-license product candidates that require translational or clinical research, we do not invest any capital in basic research, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on excellent, rapid, and efficient clinical and regulatory execution on multiple programs in parallel. We believe that building a successful and sustainable rare disease-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of patient identification, clinical study design and conduct, and regulatory strategy. We have assembled a team with a successful track record in managing global clinical development activities in an efficient manner and with multinational experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for rare disease products. Clinical studies for rare and ultra-rare diseases can often be smaller in size, fewer in number, and less expensive than those for larger market indications. Development of multiple programs in rare diseases also generates organizational efficiencies and economies of scale. We also seek to manage our fixed cost structure by outsourcing manufacturing of our product candidates. As a result of these efficiencies, we can feasibly develop multiple clinical-stage product candidates in parallel, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Seek to retain global commercialization rights to product candidates. We intend to seek and retain global commercialization rights to our product candidates whenever possible to maximize the potential value of our product portfolio. Our plan is to establish our own commercial organization in major pharmaceutical markets and develop a network of third-party distributors in smaller markets. We believe this commercial organization can be highly targeted due to the relatively small number of specialists who typically treat patients with the diseases to be addressed by our pro duct candidates. As a result, we do not expect that we will require pharmaceutical partners for commercialization of our product candidates in major markets , although we may consider partnering for certain territories or indications or for other strategic purposes. &#160;

Clinical Product Candidates 

Our current clinical-stage pipeline consists of two product categories: biologics, including a monoclonal antibody and enzyme replacement therapies; and small-molecule substrate replacement therapies. Enzymes are proteins that the body uses to process materials needed for normal cellular function, and substrates are the materials upon which enzymes act. When enzymes or substrates are missing, the body is unable to perform its normal cellular functions, often leading to significant clinical disease. Several of our therapies are intended to replace deficient enzymes or substrates. 

The following table summarizes our current clinical-stage product candidate pipeline:

KRN23 (UX023) for the treatment of XLH 

KRN23 is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered via subcutaneous injection that is designed to bind and reduce the biological activity of fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, to increase abnormally low phosphate levels in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH. Patients with XLH have low serum phosphate levels due to excessive phosphate loss into the urine, which is directly caused by the effect on kidney function of excess FGF23 production in bone cells. Low phosphate levels lead to poor bone mineralization and a variety of clinical manifestations, including rickets leading to bowing and other skeletal deformities, short stature, bone pain and fractures, and muscle weakness. There is no approved drug therapy or treatment for the underlying cause of XLH. Most patients are managed using frequently dosed oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D therapy, which can lead to significant side effects. Oral phosphate/vitamin D replacement therapy requires extremely close monitoring due to the potential for excessive phosphate levels and secondary increases in calcium, which can result in severe damage to the kidneys from excess calcium phosphate deposits and other complications. Additionally, some patients are unable to tolerate the regimen due to the chalky stool that results from taking large amounts of oral phosphate or the high frequency of dosing required.

&#160;

In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement wi th Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK, as amended in August 2015, to jointly develop and commercialize KRN23. KHK has conducted one Phase 1 study, one Phase 1/2 study and one longer-term Phase 1/2 study of KRN23 in adults with XLH. 

Results from the Phase 1 single-dose study in 38 adult XLH patients were presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, or ASBMR, Annual Meeting in October 2013 and published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February 2014. 

Results from a four-month Phase 1/2 study in 28 adult XLH patients and subsequent twelve-month Phase 1/2 study of KRN23 in 22 patients were presented at the 2014 ICE/ENDO joint meeting of The Endocrine Society and the International Congress on Endocrinology in June 2014 and ASBMR Annual Meeting in September 2014, respectively. 

In July 2014, we announced the first patient screened and enrolled in the Phase 2 pediatric study of KRN23 in patients aged 5 to 12 with XLH. The study consists of a 16-week individual dose-titration period followed by a 48-week treatment period, for a total of 64 weeks. Patients were divided into three cohorts of escalating starting dose levels of KRN23 with either monthly or biweekly dosing regimens. At the end of the 16-week dose-titration period, patients were allowed to continue to receive dose increases in order to reach the individually-optimized dose of KRN23 on a monthly or biweekly basis for the 48-week treatment period. In late 2014, we completed enrollment of 36 patients. Based on positive 16 week data, we decided to enroll an additional 16 patient cohort with patients that had more severe disease at baseline (based on their Thacher Rickets Severity Scoring System knee score &#62;1.5). Patients for the Phase 2 study were enrolled at nine global centers of excellence in XLH. The primary objectives of the study are to identify a dose and dosing regimen and to establish the safety profile of treatment with KRN23 in pediatric XLH patients. We are also assessing preliminary clinical effects of KRN23 treatment on bone health and deformity as measured by radiographic assessments, growth, muscle strength, and motor function, as well as markers of bone health and patient-reported outcomes of pain, disability, and quality of life.

In December 2015 we released interim data through 40 weeks from the first 36 patients in this study. Thirty five of 36 patients had previously been on standard of care (oral phosphate/vitamin D therapy) for an average of 6.6 years (range: 0 - 11.7 years). Patient demographics were well balanced between the biweekly (n=18) and monthly (n=18) dose groups. Rickets were evaluated via two scoring systems &#8211; the Thacher Rickets Severity Scoring System (RSS) and the Radiographic Global Impression of Change (RGI-C). A subset of patients (n=18; 9 dosed biweekly and 9 dosed monthly) were pre-specified as having high rickets severity (greater bone disease) if their baseline total RSS scores were &#62; 1.5. For the responder analysis using total RSS, responders were pre-defined as those patients who had baseline total RSS scores &#62; 1.0 and had 1.0 or more reduction at Week 40 which is considered a significant improvement. 

Overall, in all patients (n=36), the mean total RSS score decreased from 1.43 at baseline to 1.00 at 40 weeks (-0.43; 30% reduction; p=0.0076), and 61% of the patients (14/23) were responders. In all the high severity patients (n=18), the mean total rickets score decreased from 2.31 at baseline to 1.22 at 40 weeks (-1.08; 47% reduction; p&#60;0.0001), and 72% of these patients were responders (13/18). In patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=18), the mean total RSS score decreased from 1.53 at baseline to 0.86 at 40 weeks (-0.67 points; 44% reduction; p=0.0126), and 75% of the patients (9/12) were responders. In the high severity patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=9), the mean total rickets score decreased from 2.44 at baseline to 1.00 at 40 weeks (-1.44 points; 59% reduction; p&#60;0.0001), and 89% of these patients were responders (8/9). In patients who were dosed monthly (n=18), the mean total rickets score decreased from 1.33 at baseline to 1.14 at 40 weeks (-0.19 points; 14% reduction), and 46% of the patients (5/11) were responders. In the high severity patients who were dosed monthly (n=9), the mean total RSS score decreased from 2.17 at baseline to 1.44 at 40 weeks (-0.72; 33% reduction) and 56% of these patients (5/9) were responders. 

Overall, all patients (n=36) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.38 (p&#60;0.0001) and those patients who were severe (n=18) experienced a mean improvement of +1.85 (p&#60;0.0001) at 40 weeks. Within the high severity subset, 67% (12/18) experienced substantial healing (score &#62;2). Patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=18) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.56 (p&#60;0.0001). Those patients with high severity rickets (n=9) experienced a mean improvement of +2.00 (p&#60;0.0001) at 40 weeks (substantial healing) and 89% (8/9) experienced substantial healing (score &#62;2). Patients who were dosed monthly (n=18) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.20. The patients with high severity rickets (n=9) experienced a mean improvement of +1.70 at 40 weeks and 44% (4/9) experienced substantial healing (score &#62;2). 

Patients with walking impairment at baseline (defined by &#60; 80% predicted normal walk distance in the six minute walk test, or 6MWT; n=14) achieved a mean increase of 80 meters (an approximate 20% increase from baseline) at week 40. Additionally, high and low severity patients with walking impairments at baseline also experienced a mean improvement in meters walked at week 40. Functional disability scores were measured with the Pediatric Orthopedic Society North America/Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (POSNA/PODCI). When evaluating the Global score of all five domains in those patients with substantial impairment at baseline (n=15) or with severe rickets at baseline (n=18), a substantial mean improvement was observed of about one standard deviation or greater in both dose groups. The Pain/Comfort and Sports/Physical Functioning domains were the most affected at baseline and also substantially improved in these severely affected subjects treated in both dose groups. 

The most common treatment-related adverse event reported by preferred term was injection site reaction in 39% of patients. All of these reactions were considered mild. All other treatment-related adverse events were considered mild. There was one serious adverse event considered possibly treatment-related. This was a patient with fever and muscle pain who improved without 

&#160;

complication and is still in the trial. There have been no deaths or discontinuations from the study for any reason. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. None of the patients had serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal at any time point. No clinically significant changes were observed in renal ultrasounds pre- and post-treatment. All patients demonstrated increases in se rum phosphorus that were consistent with what had been observed previously reaching the low normal or just below normal range. Across both dose groups there were mean increases in both the renal phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR) and in serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels through 40 weeks of treatment. 

Additional data from the pediatric Phase 2 study (40 week data from all 52 patients) are expected in the second half of 2016. We also expect to have 64 week data, including height-growth velocity, from a subset of patients in the second half of 2016. We and our partner, KHK, plan to file for Conditional Marketing Authorization in the EU around the end of 2016 based on these data. In addition, we plan to proceed with a pediatric Phase 3 study in mid-2016. The study will likely utilize RGI-C as the primary endpoint and would include a standard of care reference arm. This study is expected to be required for potential approval in the US and could also serve as a confirmatory study in the EU if a conditional marketing authorization were granted.

We are also continuing to develop KRN23 in adults with XLH. We have initiated a long-term, open-label Phase 2b extension study of KRN23 in adult XLH patients who had previously participated in the studies conducted by KHK. In December 2015 we initiated a Phase 3 study of KRN23 for the treatment of adults with XLH. The Phase 3 study is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study that will assess the efficacy and safety of monthly KRN23 at 24 weeks in approximately 120 adult XLH patients. The primary endpoint of the study will be serum phosphorus levels through 24 weeks and the key secondary endpoint is the Brief Pain Inventory Question 3 (pain at its worst in the last 24 hours) at Week 24. Other secondary endpoints include patient reported outcomes assessing skeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue, motor function, and quality of life in these patients. A 48-week open-label bone quality study in approximately ten adult XLH patients evaluating the potential impact of KRN23 on the underlying osteomalacia via bone biopsy is currently enrolling patients. 

KRN23 (UX023) for the treatment of TIO 

We are also developing KRN23 for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO. TIO results from typically benign tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, bone fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness. There are cases in which resection of the tumor is not feasible or recurrence of the tumor occurs after resection. In patients for whom the tumor is inoperable, the current standard of care consists of oral phosphate and/or vitamin D replacement. The efficacy of this treatment is often limited, as it does not treat the underlying disease and its benefits must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism. We are enrolling patients in an open-label, proof of concept Phase 2 clinical study. Interim data from the Phase 2 study are expected in the first half of 2016.

This Phase 2 study will evaluate safety and efficacy in approximately six adult inoperable patients. The primary objectives of the study are to establish the dose and safety profile of treatment with KRN23 in TIO patients. Preliminary clinical effects of KRN23 treatment will be evaluated by radiographic assessments, muscle strength, walking ability, and patient-reported measures of pain, disability, and quality of life. Markers of bone health and changes in serum phosphorus and other biochemical measures will also be followed.

The study will consist of a 16-week individual dose-titration period followed by a 32-week treatment period. The goal of the dose-titration period is to identify the individualized dose of KRN23 required to achieve stable serum phosphorus levels in the target range. Patients will receive subcutaneous injections of KRN23 once every four weeks.

rhGUS (UX003) for the treatment of MPS 7 

Recombinant human beta-glucuronidase, or rhGUS, is an intravenous, or IV, enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis 7, or MPS 7, also known as Sly Syndrome. Patients with MPS 7 suffer from severe cellular and organ dysfunction that typically leads to death in the teens or early adulthood. MPS 7 is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to their accumulation in many tissues, resulting in a serious multi-system disease. Patients with MPS 7 may have abnormal coarsened facial features, enlargement of the liver and spleen, airway obstruction, lung disease, cardiovascular complications, joint stiffness, short stature, and a skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex. In addition, many patients experience progressive lung problems as a result of airway obstruction and mucous production, often leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, and eventually requiring tracheostomy. There are currently no approved drug therapies for MPS 7. 

We licensed exclusive worldwide rights to rhGUS-related know-how and cell lines from Saint Louis University in November 2010. We have conducted preclinical studies to support the chronic IV administration of rhGUS. Administration of rhGUS resulted in substantial distribution of enzyme, as well as reduction in tissue pathology in a wide variety of tissues, including the liver, spleen, lung, heart, kidney, muscle, bone, and brain. No adverse toxicology related to rhGUS was noted in these studies.

&#160;

In December 2013 , we initiated an open-label, Phase 1/2 study in the United Kingdom to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, a nd dose of IV administration of rhGUS every other week in three patients with MPS 7 . Results from the 12-week analysis evaluating 2 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week were presented in September 2014 at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism , or SSIEM . Annual Symposium and showed a decline in urinary glycosaminoglycans , or GAG excretion of approximately 40-50% from baseline. After the initial 12 weeks, the study entered a dose-exploration phase in which patients were treated with a lower and then higher dose of rhGUS. The 36-week results , which were presented in February 2015 at the Annual WORLD Symposium, showed a greater change in urinary GAG excretion at the higher 4 mg/kg dose of rhGUS, with a mean urinary GAG reduction of approximately 60 %. 

Sustained decreases in liver size were observed in the two patients who had enlarged livers at baseline, and an improvement in pulmonary function was observed in the one patient who was able to perform the evaluations. Improvements were also observed in the MPS Health Assessment Questionnaire measure of functional capabilities and in the Physician Global Impression of Change scale of overall health status in this open-label study.

No serious adverse events or infusion-associated reactions were observed in the study. The most common adverse events were consistent with the symptoms of MPS 7 or related to intravenous administration of the investigational therapy, including respiratory disorders, infections, and arthralgia.

We initiated a Phase 3 global, randomized, placebo-controlled, blind-start clinical study in December 2014. The Phase 3 study is assessing the efficacy and safety of rhGUS in 12 patients between five and 35 years of age. Patients are randomized to one of four groups. One cohort begins rhGUS therapy immediately, while the other three start on placebo and cross over to rhGUS at different predefined time points in a blinded manner. This study design generates treatment data from all 12 patients. Based on data from the Phase 1/2 study, patients will be dosed with 4 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week for up to a total of 48 weeks, and all groups will receive a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with rhGUS. The Phase 3 study fully enrolled in June 2015, and data are expected in mid-2016. 

The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of rhGUS as determined by the reduction in urinary GAG excretion after 24 weeks of treatment. The Phase 3 study is also evaluating as secondary endpoints the safety and tolerability of rhGUS, pulmonary function, walking, stair climb, shoulder flexion, fine and gross motor function, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac size and function, visual acuity, patient and caregiver assessment of most significant clinical problems, global impressions of change, a multi-domain responder index, and other endpoints.

We have obtained positive feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, regarding the design of the Phase 3 study. The FDA stated that their evaluation of the pivotal Phase 3 study will be based on the totality of the data on a patient-by-patient basis and advised against the declaration of a primary endpoint. The EMA has agreed that approval under exceptional circumstances could be possible based upon a single positive placebo-controlled pivotal study in approximately 12 patients using urinary GAG levels as a surrogate primary endpoint, provided the data was strongly supportive of a favorable benefit/risk ratio. The EMA requested that some evidence or trend in improvement in clinical endpoints be observed to support the primary endpoint, but recognized that a statistically significant result on clinical endpoints was unlikely given the small number of patients expected to be enrolled in the study.

In August 2015 we initiated a study of rhGUS in MPS 7 patients under the age of five years, including potentially younger infants born with hydrops fetalis. These hydropic infants can die within a few months to one year of birth, but enzyme replacement therapy might be able to reduce GAG storage and improve health in these patients. The Phase 2 open-label study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rhGUS in up to seven pediatric patients under five years old. 

We are also supplying rhGUS to investigators who are treating patients under emergency investigational new drug, or eIND, applications and other expanded access programs. Results following 24 weeks of treatment of the first eIND patient were announced in September 2014 and published in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism in February 2015. 

UX007 for the treatment of LC-FAOD 

We are developing UX007 for oral administration intended as a substrate replacement therapy for patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD. UX007 is a purified, pharmaceutical-grade form of triheptanoin, a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound, created via a multi-step chemical process. UX007 is a medium odd-chain triglyceride of seven-carbon fatty acids designed to provide substrate replacement for fatty acid metabolism and restore production of energy. Patients with LC-FAOD have a deficiency that impairs the ability to produce energy from fat, which can lead to depletion of glucose in the body, and severe liver, muscle, and heart disease, as well as death. There are currently no approved drugs or treatments specifically for LC-FAOD. The current standard of care for LC-FAOD includes diligent prevention of fasting combined with the use of low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, carnitine supplementation in some cases, and medium even-chain triglyceride oil supplementation. Despite treatment with the current standard of care, many patients continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality. 

&#160;

We licensed certain intellectual property rights for triheptanoin from Baylor Research Institute in August 2012. Triheptanoin has been studied clinically for over a decade in more than a hundred human subjects af fected by a variety of diseases. Multiple investigator-sponsored open-label studies suggest clinical improvements with triheptanoin treatment, even for patients who were on standard of care. We presented data at the International Conference of Inborn Error s of Metabolism , or ICIEM , in August 2013 from a retrospective medical record review study assessing the clinical outcome of triheptanoin treatment on LC-FAOD subjects who ha d been participating in a compassionate use program at the University of Pittsburg h Medical Center. The data showed that treatment with triheptanoin appeared to reduce the frequency and severity of hospitalizations previously experienced by these patients for disease-related causes, including muscle rupture, hypoglycemia, and cardiomyop athy. A reduction in mean total hospital days per year from 17.55 to 5.40 (69%; p = 0.0242) was observed after transitioning from standard of care to triheptanoin therapy. These results are clinically important but are derived from a retrospective medical review, and not from a prospective randomized controlled study. 

In September 2015, case reports from five infants with moderate or severe cardiomyopathy due to LC-FAOD were presented at the SSIEM Annual Symposium. While on the standard of care medium-chain triglyceride, or MCT, oil, the patients were hospitalized with heart failure that required cardiac support and, in some cases, resuscitation. The patients discontinued MCT oil and then began to receive triheptanoin on an expanded access basis. In patients with known ejection fraction, or EF, values before and after treatment (n=4) the mean EF prior to treatment with triheptanoin was 32% (range: 21% to 44%) and after treatment at last assessment was 66% (range: 55% to 71%). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal distress, including loose stools. One patient discontinued treatment after approximately 14 weeks due to gastrointestinal symptoms. No other significant tolerance issues or treatment-related adverse events were reported. Four of the patients continue to receive triheptanoin. These data are from an expanded access program and are based on open-label uncontrolled treatment, which limits definitive conclusions about efficacy and safety.

In October 2015, we reported interim data on the acute effects of UX007 that was being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in LC-FAOD patients. The study was single-arm open-label and evaluated 29 pediatric and adult patients across three main symptom groups (musculoskeletal, liver/hypoglycemia, and cardiac). Patients needed to have moderate to severe FAOD with significant disease in at least one of these domains or a frequent medical events history in order to enroll. The study began with a four-week run-in period to assess baseline data while on the standard of care therapy including MCT oil, if applicable. Patients on MCT oil then discontinued it and UX007 was titrated to a target dose of 25-35% of total daily caloric intake. Patients were followed to evaluate the effects of UX007 treatment over 24 weeks on several endpoints, including cycle ergometry performance, 12-minute walk test, liver disease/hypoglycemia, cardiac disease, and quality of life. The 24-week analysis mainly evaluated the acute effects of UX007 on the musculoskeletal aspects of the disease. Patients who opted to continue will be treated for a total of 78 weeks, and rates of major medical events, such as rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia and cardiac events, will be monitored and compared to rates for the two years prior to treatment with UX007. The study planned to evaluate the safety and tolerability of UX007 and to determine both the appropriate patient population as well as endpoints for evaluation in a Phase 3 study. The majority of patients enrolled presented with musculoskeletal disease compared to a limited number who presented with liver and cardiac symptoms. Patients spanned a wide age range from ten months to 58 years old. Prior to initiating treatment with UX007, 27 of the 29 patients were on the standard of care MCT oil therapy. Following discontinuation of MCT oil therapy, the average dose of UX007 through 24 weeks was 30% of total daily caloric intake.

Improvements were observed in both measures of exercise tolerance (cycle ergometry and 12 minute walk test) in musculoskeletal patients who performed the tests. The three areas of evaluation with cycle ergometry included workload (measured in watts produced at a fixed heart rate), respiratory exchange ratio, or RER, a measure of energy supply, and duration of cycling. Patients showed improvements in both workload and duration and no change in RER. At week 24, seven patients (who qualified by age and performed the test at baseline) produced a mean 60% increase in watts over baseline representing a mean increase of +446.8 watts (median: +127.5; min, max: -388, +2438). The mean duration was increased in 3 patients who did not complete all 40 minutes at baseline. Eight qualified patients demonstrated a mean 28% increase of +188 meters (median: 93.5; min, max: -80, +880) at week 18 in the 12-minute walk test. These patients also experienced an improvement in the mean energy expenditure index (a ratio of heart rate per meter walked). The data on the 12 minute walk test and cycle ergometry together support an improvement in muscle function and exercise efficiency in a small number of patients that would need to be confirmed in larger controlled studies. Patients with liver/hypoglycemia and cardiac disease were limited, 3 and 2 respectively, but they qualified for entry due to frequent history of events and will contribute to the event rate measurement over 78 weeks. 

Overall major medical events appeared to decrease in the 25 patients who completed the 24 weeks of treatment when compared to the reported event rate in these patients approximately 18 months prior to treatment with UX007. These data are preliminary and require significantly more time for proper evaluation at the 78 week time-point. The major medical event rate aggregates events related to hypoglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiomyopathy.

Improvements in patient-reported quality of life scores (SF-12) were observed in adult patients, but no difference was seen in parent-reported scores (SF-10) for pediatric patients. The Peabody Developmental Motor Score (PDMS-2) and the Pediatric Disability Inventory (PEDI-CAT), also showed no impairment in the overall patient population at baseline and no change after 24 weeks.

Four of the 29 enrolled patients discontinued prior to 24 weeks. One patient discontinued due to diarrhea in week 1, which resolved within a few days of discontinuation, and three patients withdrew consent (weeks 1, 8, 8) for reasons not attributed to treatment with UX007. All other patients opted to continue treatment in the extension phase of the study. There have been no deaths. One serious related adverse event of moderate gastroenteritis with vomiting was considered treatment-related. A viral infection was 

&#160;

suspected, but the investigator could not rule ou t cause by UX007 given the proximity to dosing. That patient continues to be treated in the study and maintained dosing throughout the event, which has now resolved. Overall, 18 patients (62%) had treatment-related adverse events, most of which were mild-t o-moderate in nature. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, and vomiting. Some gastrointestinal events were managed by adjusting dosing or dosing with food. The most common adverse events, includin g those not deemed treatment-related, were viral infections, gastrointestinal disorders, rhabdomyolysis, fever, and headache. 

We are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study in LC-FAOD patients in 2017 based on these interim Phase 2 data. We intend to provide further details after completing discussions with the regulatory authorities.

UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS 

We are also developing UX007 for patients with glucose transporter type-1 deficiency syndrome, or Glut1 DS. Glut1 DS is caused by a mutation affecting the gene that codes for Glut1, which is a protein that transports glucose from the blood into the brain. Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, Glut1 DS results in a chronic state of brain energy deficiency and is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. There are currently no approved drugs specific to Glut1 DS. The current standard of care for Glut1 DS is the ketogenic diet, an extreme high-fat (70-80% of daily calories as fat)/low-carbohydrate diet, which generates ketone bodies as an alternative energy source to glucose, and one or more antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet can be effective in reducing seizures but compliance can be difficult, and the effectiveness of the diet in the treatment of developmental delay and movement disorders has not been confirmed. In addition, ketogenic diet can lead to side effects including renal stones. In general, Glut1 DS patients are considered relatively refractory to antiepileptic drugs with only approximately 8% achieving seizure control on antiepileptic drugs alone. There are currently no antiepileptic drugs approved specifically for patients with Glut1 DS.

UX007 is intended as a substrate replacement therapy to provide an alternative source of energy to the brain in Glut1 DS patients. There are open-label investigator-sponsored clinical studies ongoing, and there is one publication presenting data on absence seizure reduction and improved developmental function in some Glut1 DS subjects taking UX007.

In March 2014, we initiated a Phase 2 global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study that plans to enroll up to 40 patients who are currently not fully compliant with ketogenic diet and continue to have seizures. The primary efficacy objective is the reduction in frequency of seizures compared to placebo following a 6-week baseline period and subsequent 8-week placebo-controlled treatment period. Other efficacy objectives include cognitive function and movement disorder. The blinded treatment period will be followed by an open-label extension period in which patients will be treated with UX007 through week 52. In order to accelerate enrollment, we amended the enrollment criteria to also include patients with only absence seizures. The study will enroll up to 40 patients with data expected in the second half of 2016, subject to enrollment.

In April 2015, positive data from an investigator-sponsored study of UX007 for the treatment of movement disorders associated with Glut1 DS were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. The data showed a statistically significant 90% reduction in movement disorder events after treatment with UX007 (p=0.028) and a statistically significant increase in events after withdrawal from treatment with UX007 (p=0.043). Based on these study results, and following an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, in November 2015 we announced an update to our development plan for UX007 in Glut1 DS patients. We now plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in Glut1 DS patients with the movement disorder phenotype in the second half of 2016. The study is intended to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double cross-over study. The primary endpoint will be an assessment of the impact of UX007 on movement disorder events as recorded by a patient diary that will be further refined in discussions with the FDA. If the data are positive, the two studies are intended to support a new drug application, or NDA, filing for the treatment of Glut1 DS. 

Ace-ER (UX001) for the treatment of GNE myopathy

We are developing aceneuramic acid extended-release (Ace-ER), formerly known as sialic acid extended-release (SA-ER), which is an extended-release, oral formulation of sialic acid for the treatment of GNE myopathy, which is also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy, or HIBM. GNE myopathy is characterized by severe progressive muscular myopathy, or disease in which muscle fibers do not function properly, with onset typically in the late teens or twenties. Patients with GNE myopathy have a genetic defect in the gene coding for a particular enzyme that is involved in the first step in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. Therefore, GNE myopathy patients have a sialic acid deficiency, which interferes with muscle function, leading to myopathy and atrophy. Patients typically lose major muscle function within ten to 20 years of diagnosis. There is no approved drug therapy for GNE myopathy. 

Ace-ER is intended as a potential substrate replacement therapy designed to address sialic acid deficiency and restore muscle function in GNE myopathy patients. We have conducted a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ace-ER in 47 GNE myopathy patients. Data from this study were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in April 2014. Patients in the study were initially randomized to receive placebo, three grams, or six grams of Ace-ER per day. After 24 weeks, placebo patients crossed over to either three grams or six grams total daily dose, for an additional 24 weeks. The final analysis compared change at week 48 from baseline for the combined groups at six grams versus three grams of Ace-ER. Assessments included pharmacokinetics, composites of upper extremity and lower extremity muscle strength as measured by dynamometry, other clinical endpoints, patient reported outcomes, and safety.

&#160;

At 24 weeks, assessments of upper extremity composite of muscle strength showed a statistically significant difference in the six - gram group compared to placebo (+2.33 kg; 5.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.040). At 48 weeks, a stati stically significant difference between the combined six - gram group and the combined three - gram group was observed (+3.44 kg; 8.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.0033). Patients with less advanced disease (able to walk more than 200 meters at basel ine), a predefined subset, showed a more pronounced difference (+4.69 kg; 9.6% relative difference from baseline; p=0.00055). The lower extremity composite showed a similar pattern of response but did not show a statistically significant difference between the dose groups. None of the groups showed a significant decline in the lower extremity composite during the treatment period. A positive trend was seen in patient-reported outcomes of functional activity consistent with the potential clinical meaningfuln ess of the muscle strength assessment. A ce -ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date in either dose group, and no dose-dependent treatment-emergent adverse events were identified. Most adverse events were mild to mode rate and the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and pain related to muscle biopsy procedures. 

We continued to treat these patients in an extension study evaluating an increased daily dosage of sialic acid based on the dose dependence observed at weeks 24 and 48. Interim data from the extension study were presented at the International Congress of the World Muscle Society, or WMS, in October 2014. In the first part of the extension study, all 46 patients who completed the 48-week Phase 2 study crossed over to six grams for a variable period of time that was on average 24 weeks. In the second part of the extension study, all 46 patients and 13 treatment-na&#239;ve patients received 12 grams of Ace-ER for 24 weeks. The results presented at WMS include the 49 out of 59 patients who had 24 weeks of data at the higher dose. While the 12-gram data did not suggest any clinically meaningful advantage over six grams, the 12-gram data do provide additional data that supported clinical activity with Ace-ER treatment. The higher dose appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, but the rate of mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events did appear to be greater with this dose. Throughout the approximately two-year study period, treatment with Ace-ER appeared to slow the progression of upper extremity disease when compared to the 24-week placebo group extrapolated out to two years.

We initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 48-week pivotal Phase 3 study of Ace-ER in approximately 80 patients with GNE myopathy in May 2015. The FDA agreed with the Phase 3 study design, including the primary endpoint of a composite of upper extremity muscle strength, with supportive secondary endpoint data from a patient-reported outcome, both of which were studied in the Phase 2 study. Data from the Phase 3 study are expected in 2017.

In October 2015 we announced the filing and acceptance of a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking conditional approval from the EMA based on our Phase 2 study results for the use of six grams per day of Ace-ER tablets in the treatment of GNE myopathy. The CHMP opinion on the conditional marketing authorization is expected in the second half of 2016.

Preclinical Pipeline

rhPPCA (UX004) for the treatment of galactosialidosis 

Recombinant human protective protein cathepsin-A, or rhPPCA, which we in-licensed from St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital in September 2012, is in preclinical development as an enzyme replacement therapy for galactosialidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease for which there are no currently approved drug therapies. Similar to MPS patients, patients with galactosialidosis present with both soft tissue storage in the liver, spleen, and other tissues, as well as connective tissue (bone and cartilage) related disease. As with MPS 7, an enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of substrates in the lysosomes, causing skeletal and organ dysfunction, and death. We are continuing preclinical development of rhPPCA with plans to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, in 2017. 

Collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. for mRNA therapeutics

We signed a research collaboration and license agreement with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. to develop mRNA therapeutics for select rare disease targets in October 2015. The Arcturus collaboration may help us address a wider range of rare diseases than possible with current approaches. As part of the collaboration, Arcturus will utilize its UNA Oligomer&#8482; chemistry and LUNAR&#8482; nanoparticle delivery platform to initially design and optimize mRNA therapeutics for two targets selected by us; we also have the option to add up to eight additional targets during the collaborative research period.

Other preclinical programs

We continue to work on other compounds in various preclinical stages of development. 

Competition 

The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from individual investigators, major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies, and ultimately biosimilar and generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 

&#160;

The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience. 

With respect to KRN23, although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development for the treatment of XLH, it is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches such as gene therapy, to treat XLH. Most pediatric patients with XLH are managed using oral phosphate replacement and/or vitamin D therapy, which is relatively inexpensive and therefore may adversely affect our ability to commercialize KRN23, if approved, in some countries. 

With respect to rhGUS and rhPPCA, we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for MPS 7 or galactosialidosis, but it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat these diseases. Additionally, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches may emerge for the treatment of lysosomal diseases. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants have also been used in MPS 7 and in other lysosomal storage diseases and represent a potential competing therapy. Stem cell transplants have been effective in treating soft tissue storage and in having an impact on brain disease, but have not to date proven effective in treating bone and connective tissue disease. Typically, enzyme replacement therapy has had an impact on bone and connective tissue disease in other disorders when patients were treated early. 

With respect to UX007/triheptanoin, there are currently no approved drugs or treatments for patients with LC-FAOD or Glut1 DS. LC-FAOD is commonly treated with diet therapy and MCT oil, and UX007 would compete with MCT oil. Glut1 DS is commonly treated with ketogenic diet and antiepileptic drugs. UX007 may compete with these approaches, though it may potentially be used in combination. Although we believe that UX007 should be considered a drug and will be regulated that way, it is possible that other companies or individuals may attempt to produce triheptanoin for use in LC-FAOD, Glut1 DS, and other patients by attempting to sell the product via a nutritional supplement or medical food pathway. Investigators are testing triheptanoin in clinical studies across multiple indications, including LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. For example, B. Braun Medical Inc., or B. Braun, has applied for and received orphan drug designation for triheptanoin for the treatment of certain types of LC-FAOD in Europe; however, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical development activities by B. Braun. It is also possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize other medium odd-chain fatty acids, or completely different compounds, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. Other companies may also utilize other approaches, such as gene therapy, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. 

With respect to Ace-ER, although there are currently no approved drug therapies for the treatment of HIBM, it is possible that others may develop alternative approaches to the treatment of HIBM, including other metabolites from the sialic acid pathway, prodrugs, other drug therapies, and gene therapy. We are aware of a program at the National Institutes of Health that is investigating the use of another metabolite in the sialic acid pathway, N-acetyl mannosamine, or ManNAc, for the treatment of HIBM. Escala Therapeutics Inc. (a subsidiary of Fortress Biotech) acquired from New Zealand Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a license from the NIH for the development of ManNAc for the treatment of GNE Myopathy. New Zealand Pharmaceuticals manufactures ManNAc and is its exclusive global supplier to Escala Therapeutics. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed and an open-label, three-month Phase 2 study is ongoing. 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 

License Agreements 

Kyowa Hakko Kirin 

In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), which was amended in August 2015. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, we and KHK will collaborate on the development and commercialization of certain products containing KRN23, an antibody directed towards FGF23, in the field of orphan diseases in the United States and Canada, or the &#8220;profit-share territory&#8221;, and in the European Union, Switzerland, and Turkey, or the European territory, and we will have the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America. In the field of orphan diseases, and except for ongoing studies being conducted by KHK, we will be the lead party for development activities in the profit-share territory and in the European territory until the applicable transition date; we will also be the lead party for core development activities conducted in Japan and Korea, provided that the core development plan related to Japan and Korea shall be limited to clinical trials mutually agreed to by the Company and KHK. We will share the costs for development activities in the profit share territory and European territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KHK and KHK shall be responsible for 100% of the costs for development activities in Japan and Korea. On the applicable transition date in the profit-share territory and the European territory, KHK will become the lead party and be responsible for the costs of the development activities. However, we will continue to share the costs of the studies commenced prior to the applicable transition date equally with KHK. We have the primary responsibility for 

&#160;

conducting certain research and development activities . We are obligated to provide assistance in accordance with the agreed upon development plan as well as participate on various committees. If KRN23 is approved, we and KH K will share commercial responsibilities and profits in the profit share territory until the applicable transition date, KHK will commercialize KRN23 in the European territory, and we will develop and commercialize KRN23 in Latin America. KHK will manufact ure and supply KRN23 for clinical use globally and will manufacture and supply KRN23 for commercial use in the profit share territory and Latin America. 

In the profit share territory, KHK will book sales of products and we will have the sole right to promote the products for a specified period of time, with KHK increasingly participating in the promotion of the products until five years from commercial launch, after which KHK will have the sole right to promote the products, subject to a limited promotion right retained by us. In the European territory, KHK will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. In Latin America, we will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. 

The profit or loss from commercializing products in the profit-share territory, until the applicable transition date, will be shared between us and KHK on a 50/50 basis. Thereafter, we will be entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share in the mid-to-high 20% range in the profit share territory, intended to approximate the profit share. We will also be entitled to receive a royalty of up to 10% on net sales in the European territory. In Latin America, we will pay to KHK a low single-digit royalty on net sales. Our and KHK&#8217;s obligations to pay royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis for so long as we or KHK, as applicable, are selling products in such country. 

KHK will supply all quantities of product for clinical studies. KHK will also supply all quantities of product for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America. The supply price to us for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America will be determined based on a fixed double-digit percentage of net sales. 

The collaboration and license agreement will continue for as long as products in the field of orphan diseases are sold in the profit-share territory, European territory, or Latin America, unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

KHK may terminate the agreement in certain countries or territories based upon our failure to meet certain milestones. Specifically, if we do not obtain U.S. or European marketing approval of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH by a certain date, or make a first commercial sale, on a country-by-country basis, in Latin America by certain deadlines, KHK may terminate the agreement only with respect to the applicable territory or country in which the milestone was not timely met. In certain circumstances, we have the right to obtain an extension of the applicable deadline by making a payment to KHK in the low single-digit to low double-digit millions of dollars, depending on the milestone. Also, in the event of the occurrence of certain excusable delays, the deadline for meeting the applicable milestone above is extended to account for the period of the delay. Furthermore, either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. In any event of termination by KHK, unless such termination is the result of KHK&#8217;s termination for certain types of breach of the agreement by us, we may receive low single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net post-termination sales by KHK in one or more countries or territories, the amount of which varies depending on the timing of, and reason for, such termination. In any event of termination, our rights to KRN23 under the agreement and our obligations to share development costs will cease, and the program will revert to KHK, worldwide if the agreement is terminated as a whole or solely in the terminated countries if the agreement is terminated solely with respect to certain countries. 

Saint Louis University 

In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Saint Louis University, or SLU, wherein SLU granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to GUS. Under the terms of the license agreement, SLU granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell therapeutics related to SLU&#8217;s beta-glucuronidase product, such as our rhGUS product candidate, for use in the treatment of human diseases. Under this agreement, we agreed to use best efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product as soon as practicable consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment. 

Under the license agreement, we paid SLU a nominal up-front fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense. We will make a milestone payment of $0.1 million upon approval of a glucuronidase-based enzyme therapy for treatment of MPS 7. Additionally, upon reaching a certain level of cumulative worldwide sales of the product, we will pay to SLU a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products in any country or region, subject to certain potential deductions. Our obligation to pay royalties to SLU continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the product in such country or, in the United States, Japan, and the EU, until the later expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity. We may deduct a portion of the royalty owed if a third-party license is required. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and SLU may terminate the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy, or challenge of the licensed patents or technology, and SLU may terminate the agreement or render our license non-exclusive if we fail to meet our diligence obligations. Unless terminated as set forth above, this license agreement continues in full force and effect until the latest of expiration of the last patent based on technology licensed under the agreement, at which point our license becomes fully paid. 

&#160;

Baylor Research Institute 

In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, whereby we exclusively licensed certain intellectual property related to triheptanoin for North America and paid BRI an up-front fee of $0.3 million. The license includes patents, patent applications, know-how, and intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of triheptanoin as well as its use in treating a number of orphan diseases, including FAOD. The license grant includes the sole right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize licensed products for all human and animal uses. In June 2013, we exercised our option to license this intellectual property outside of North America and paid BRI the $0.8 million fee associated with this option exercise. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in select orphan indications. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations with respect to a specified orphan indication or set of orphan indications, BRI may convert our license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such orphan indication or set of orphan indications until we receive regulatory approval for licensed products in the applicable orphan indication or set of orphan indications. We are also obligated to pay a mid-single digit royalty on net sales to BRI, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our obligation to pay royalties to BRI continues on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the first regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to such product in such country or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, in each case in connection with approval in such country for FAOD or an orphan disease covered by our license from BRI. We may make future payments of up to $10.5 million contingent upon attainment of certain development milestones and $7.5 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either we or BRI may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. If we terminate for BRI&#8217;s breach or bankruptcy, our license from BRI will remain in effect, subject to our continued payment of reduced milestones and royalties. Unless terminated for convenience or material breach or bankruptcy, as applicable, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license from BRI with respect to such product in such country becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid and royalty-free. 

Nobelpharma 

In September 2010, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Nobelpharma Co., Ltd. (Nobelpharma), which was amended in August 2015. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, each party granted the other party a worldwide exclusive license under certain of that party&#8217;s intellectual property related to the compound identified as N-acetylneuraminic acid, also known as sialic acid, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products. Nobelpharma&#8217;s licensed territory includes Japan and certain other Asian countries, and our licensed territory includes the rest of the world. The parties conduct development independently, and each party is obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for licensed products in its territory and, in our case, to obtain patent term extensions and data exclusivity in Europe and North America, and share with the other party all data, documentation, and information that is generated in conducting such activities. Nobelpharma must use commercially reasonable efforts to supply us with the sialic acid drug substance. Either Nobelpharma or we can terminate this supply arrangement for convenience, at which point Nobelpharma would provide technical assistance to allow us to manufacture the sialic acid drug substance ourselves. If we choose to manufacture the sialic acid drug substance, Nobelpharma will have the right to purchase the sialic acid drug substance from us and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply Nobelpharma with the sialic acid drug substance. 

Under the collaboration and license agreement, we paid Nobelpharma an upfront fee of $0.1 million (10 million Yen), which was recorded as research and development expense in 2010, and also issued 76,567 shares of common stock to Nobelpharma. In addition, we are required to make certain payments to Nobelpharma based upon achievement of certain development and approval milestones. We have paid $0.5 million in development milestone payments since the inception of the agreement through December 31, 2015. The remaining total aggregate payments, if all milestones are achieved by Nobelpharma, would be 200 million Yen (approximately $1.7 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2015). We will pay a mid-single digit royalty on net sales in our territory and will receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales in the Nobelpharma territory, excluding Japan, if such product sales are ever achieved. Net sales, as defined in the collaboration and license agreement, represent the net sales of products whereby the licensed compound is the active ingredient. If the products include other active ingredients, the portion of the net sales allocated to the licensed compound would be used in determining the royalty payments. 

If either party terminates the agreement, the terminating party&#8217;s license will become irrevocable and royalty-free. Unless terminated for material breach or bankruptcy, as applicable, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the date of the first launch of a generic product of the licensed product in a country.

&#160;

AAIPharma 

In March 2011, we entered into a license agreement with AAIPharma Services Corp., or AAIPharma. Under the terms of this license agreement, AAIPharma granted us a fully paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell products incorporating AAIPharma&#8217;s controlled release matrix solid dose oral tablet technology for use in connection with sialic acid for the treatment of HIBM or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. Under the license agreement, we will pay a mid-single digit percentage of any sublicense revenue received by us related to the sublicense of AAIPharma technology. As consideration, we agreed to provide preclinical and clinical data to AAIPharma. AAIPharma is responsible for patent prosecution and maintenance, subject to our right to review and comment on such prosecution and maintenance. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. 

HIBM Research Group 

In April 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with HIBM Research Group, or HRG, wherein HRG granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the treatment of HIBM and related conditions using substrate replacement therapy. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, we paid HRG a nominal up-front fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense. We will make future payments contingent upon attainment of various development and approval milestones of up to $0.3 million in the aggregate. Additionally, we will pay to HRG a royalty of less than 1% of net sales of products, if any. Our obligation to pay royalties to HRG continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, or the later expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in certain countries. We are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a substrate replacement therapy for HIBM. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. We must also terminate the agreement if we terminate our HIBM substrate replacement therapy program. Unless terminated for convenience, for our termination of our HIBM substrate replacement therapy program, or for material breach or bankruptcy, as applicable, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration date of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, or the later expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in certain countries, at which point our license becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid, and royalty-free. 

St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital 

In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, or St. Jude, wherein St. Jude granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to rhPPCA. Under the terms of the license agreement, St. Jude granted us an exclusive license under certain know-how to research, develop, make, use, offer to sell, import, and otherwise commercialize and exploit certain PPCA protein products to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose galactosialidosis and other monogenetic diseases. We agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 

Under the license agreement, we paid St. Jude a nominal up-front fee, which was recorded as research and development expense. Additionally, we will pay to St. Jude a royalty of less than 1% on net sales of these products for so long as such products retain orphan drug exclusivity, on a country-by-country basis. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and St. Jude may terminate the agreement for our material breach of the agreement. Unless terminated for convenience or material breach, as applicable, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid, and royalty-free. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing marketing or data exclusivity periods, orphan drug status, and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and China. See &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,&#8221; &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity,&#8221; &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Patent Term Restoration,&#8221; &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Biosimilars and Exclusivity,&#8221; &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs,&#8221; &#8220;U.S. Government Regulation &#8212; Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay,&#8221; and &#8220;European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation &#8212; Orphan Designation and Exclusivity&#8221; below for additional information. 

&#160;

We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cann ot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 

We seek regulatory approval for our products in disease areas with high unmet medical need, significant market potential, and where we expect to have a proprietary position through patents covering various aspects of our products, such as composition, dosage, formulation, use, and manufacturing process, among others. Our success depends in part on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. 

Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to achieve or maintain market exclusivity or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see &#8220;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

As of February 19, 2016, we own 3 issued U.S. patent and 9 pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, as of February 19, 2016, we have licensed 15 issued U.S. patents and 35 pending U.S. patent applications, as well as corresponding foreign patents and applications from third parties, on an exclusive basis. With respect to our issued patents in the United States and Europe, we are also entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA. The patent portfolios for our five leading product candidates as of February 19, 2016 are summarized below.

KRN23 

We have rights from KHK to patents and patent applications relating to KRN23, a fully human monoclonal antibody against FGF23, and its use for the treatment of XLH and various other hypophosphatemic conditions. Pursuant to this license, we share rights to 20 issued patents, including 3 U.S. patents and 2 pending U.S. applications, as well as patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering generic and specific antibodies against FGF23 as well as their use for the treatment of XLH and related conditions. The patent terms for issued patents in the United States are from 2022 to 2029 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2028 to 2035. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available to us under regulatory provisions in certain countries. KRN23 has received orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe for the treatment of XLH. 

rhGUS 

We have no issued patents covering rhGUS but we have 2 pending U.S. patent applications and a corresponding international patent application directed to compositions with certain characteristics that are useful for the enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of multi-system lysosomal storage disease. Throughout clinical research and development, we also intend to file patent applications directed to various aspects of the treatment therapy including dosage, regimen, formulation, and manufacturing, among others. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. rhGUS has received orphan drug designation in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of MPS 7. 

UX007 

We are the licensee or owner of patents and patent applications relating to UX007 and its use for a number of diseases including FAOD and Glut1 DS. In particular, we have an exclusive license from Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, with respect to its UX007 patent portfolio. We have licensed from BRI 27 issued patents, including 9 U.S. patents and 5 pending U.S. applications and patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering composition, formulation, use and manufacturing of UX007 and related odd carbon fatty acids. The patent terms for issued patents in the United States are from 2020 to 2025 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2020 to 2033. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. UX007 for the treatment of FAOD and Glut1 DS has received orphan drug designation in the United States. 

&#160;

A ce -ER 

We are the licensee or owner of patents and patent applications relating to sialic acid and its use for the treatment of HIBM. We own or have rights to 2 issued U.S. patents and 6 pending U.S. applications and patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering the use of sialic acid for the treatment of HIBM, as well as extended release formulations of sialic acid. The patent terms for the issued patents in the United States are from 2031 to 2032 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2028 to 2031. 

We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. Ace-ER has received orphan drug designation in both the United States and the EU for the treatment of HIBM. 

rhPPCA 

We are the licensee of patent applications relating to the use of rhPPCA for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we have an exclusive license from the St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, or St. Jude. Furthermore, we intend to build a patent portfolio directed to rhPPCA compositions with certain characteristics that are useful for the enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease as well as various aspects of the treatment therapy including dosage, regimen, formulation, manufacturing, etc. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

Trademarks 

We have filed trademark applications for the Ultragenyx brand in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions. 

Other 

We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanisms including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.

Manufacturing 

We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical studies and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. 

To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full scale commercial demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 

KRN23 

The drug substance and drug product for KRN23 are made by KHK in Japan under the collaboration and license agreement with KHK. The cell line to produce KRN23 is specific for this product and is in KHK&#8217;s control. All other raw materials are commercially available. 

&#160;

rhGUS 

rhGUS drug substance and drug product are manufactured by Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, or Rentschler, under a development and clinical supply agreement executed in August 2012. Pursuant to the clinical supply agreement, we have agreed not to source larger quantities of drug substance or drug product from another supplier than from Rentschler in any given year. The supply agreement will continue in full force and effect until all clinical services have been completed or terminated per the terms of the supply agreement. Either party may terminate the supply agreement if the other party fails to pay any sum payable under the supply agreement within 30 days after a written demand is issued after the original due date, if the other party makes a material misrepresentation or commits a material breach of its obligations under the supply agreement and fails to cure such breach within specified time periods if curable, if the other party ceases to carry on its business for a period no less than 60 days, or if a party experiences certain insolvency events. Additionally, either party may terminate the supply agreement upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice if the Steering Committee concludes that the services required under the supply agreement cannot be performed and we may terminate the agreement at any time before completion of the services rendered pursuant to the agreement upon 60 days&#8217; prior written notice. The cell line to produce rhGUS is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. 

UX007 

The pharmaceutical-grade drug substance for UX007 is manufactured by Cremer Oleo GmbH &#38; Co. KG in Germany under an exclusive worldwide supply agreement, subject to certain limitations, executed in 2012. The supply agreement has an initial term of three years; thereafter, the agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional two-year periods unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew in writing at least three calendar months before the expiration of the then current term. Additionally, if a party materially breaches an obligation under the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days of receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. UX007 drug product manufacturing has been done with more than one party and is not considered a very specialized task. 

Ace-ER 

The drug substance for Ace-ER is currently manufactured by Sanyo Fine Co., Ltd. in Japan through the license agreement with Nobelpharma. The Ace-ER drug product is manufactured by AAIPharma under our license agreement and accompanying purchase orders with AAIPharma. We are in the process of securing secondary sources of drug substance and drug product for SA-ER. Manufacture of the drug substance requires a specialized enzyme-catalyzed step, and a secondary source of the enzyme itself is also under development. All raw materials to produce the drug substance and drug product are commercially available. The cell line to produce the specialized enzyme is under our control and is stored in multiple secured locations. 

rhPPCA 

No commercial supplier has yet been selected to manufacture rhPPCA. The cell line to produce rhPPCA is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. We are currently developing a manufacturing process for rhPPCA.

Sales and Marketing 

We are building capabilities in the United States, Europe and Latin America necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates. The commercial infrastructure for rare disease products typically consists of a targeted, specialty field organization that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by field management, medical liaisons, internal support, and distribution support. One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases. 

Additional capabilities important to the rare disease marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved. 

Outside of the United States and Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract organizations to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, such as in Latin America, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state, and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP; 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. 

Clinical Studies 

Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with protocols and GCP. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site&#8217;s IRB, before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 

The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patie nt population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug produc t, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 4 . In some cases, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. Failure to timely conduct required Phase 4 clinical trials and follow-up could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 

A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 

The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

The clinical study process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. 

Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to an application user fee. For fiscal year 2016, the application user fee exceeds $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, set at $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment, as well as new application fees in excess of $1.1 million for supplemental applications with clinical data. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the NDA and BLA user fees and may be exempted from product and establishment user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. 

An NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s Decision on an NDA or BLA 

The FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may impose additional requirements, such as post-marketing studies and/or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. These requirements can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 

A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA&#8217;s review and approval of NDAs and BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug&#8217;s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. 

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.

Post-Approval Requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. 

Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with GMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

&#160;

Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issue s with our pharmacovigilance systems or at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems wit h a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 

Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 

Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor&#8217;s data. 

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration 

Some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to an FDA-approved reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 

Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being addressed by the FDA. In 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar in the U.S., and published a proposed rule and guidance documents relating to various provisions of the BPCI Act. For example, the FDA addressed the naming conventions and labeling of biosimilar products, including whether and how such labeling should include information from reference product labeling and identify a product&#8217;s approval through the biosimilar pathway. The FDA suggested that shared nonproprietary names may not be appropriate for all biological products, noting that the naming conventions could improve pharmacovigilance, prevent inadvertent substitution among products which have not been determined to be interchangeable, avoid inaccurate perceptions of the safety and effectiveness of biological products based on their licensure pathway, and provide a consistent mechanism for healthcare professionals to identify biological products. The FDA also released guidance recommendations relating to the clinical, scientific, and quality data required to demonstrate biosimilarity. 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, quality and performance characteristics, the strength of the drug, and intended use. A generic drug is &#8220;bioequivalent&#8221; to the innovator drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug when administered at the same molar dose of the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or multiple doses, or in limited other circumstances. 

&#160;

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that t he generic product is &#8220;therapeutically equivalent&#8221; to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Physicians and pharmacists consider an &#8220;AB&#8221; therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#8217;s designation of an &#8220;AB&#8221; rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 

The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA or supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. 

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, a clinical study application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, the clinical study may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. The content of the NDA or BLA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. 

&#160;

Countries that are part of the EU , as well as countries outside of the EU , have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or wit hdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Authorization Procedures in the European Union 

Medicines can be authorized in the EU by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160;

&#183; 

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

In most cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric studies and their timing relative to clinical studies in adults. 

New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 

In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 

In the EU, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. 

In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

&#160;

Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval 

Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually. 

Accelerated Review 

Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding &#8220;clock stops&#8221; when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). The opinion of the CHMP is then transferred to the European Commission, in order to initiate the Decision Making process, which lasts 67 days in total. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 

In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

&#160;

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the governmen t and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on ph armaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage p olicies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

The Healthcare Reform Law broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 249 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160;

We recognized $114.7 million, $46.0 million, and $27.8 million in research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Product Liability Insurance 

We maintain product liability insurance that provides coverage in the amount of $10.0 million per incident and $10.0 million in aggregate.
