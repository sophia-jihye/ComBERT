 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

The Corporation was formed in 1974 as a bank holding company. The Corporation is a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act). The Corporation has four reportable business segments: Community Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance and Consumer Finance. As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had 288 Community Banking offices in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia and 76 Consumer Finance offices in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky. 

As a diversified financial services holding company, the Corporation, through its subsidiaries, provides a full range of financial services, principally to consumers, corporations, governments and small- to medium-sized businesses in its market areas. The Corporation&#146;s business strategy focuses primarily on providing quality, consumer- and commercial-based financial services adapted to the needs of each of the markets it serves. The Corporation seeks to maintain its community orientation by providing local management with certain autonomy in decision making, enabling them to respond to customer requests more quickly and to concentrate on transactions within their market areas. However, while the Corporation seeks to preserve some decision making at a local level, it has centralized legal, loan review and underwriting, accounting, investment, audit, loan operations, deposit operations and data processing functions. The centralization of these processes enables the Corporation to maintain consistent quality of these functions and to achieve certain economies of scale. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had total assets of $17.6 billion, loans of $12.2 billion and deposits of $12.6 billion. See Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; and Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#148; of this Report. 

Recent Developments 

The Corporation seeks to grow organically and by opportunistic acquisitions. Descriptions of the most recent acquisitions by the Corporation are provided below. 

Pending Branch Purchase &#150; Fifth Third Bank 

On September 3, 2015, the Corporation announced that it entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire approximately $383,000 in retail and private banking deposits, 17 branch-banking locations and related consumer loans in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area from Fifth Third Bank.

&#160;

approximately $2.3 billion. The acquisition was valued at approximately $403.0 million and resulted in the Corporation issuing 34,041,181 shares of its common stock in exchange for 14,345,319 shares of METR common stock.

Debt Offering 

On October 2, 2015, the Corporation completed its offering of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% subordinated notes due in 2025. The subordinated notes are eligible for treatment as tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $98.4 million. The Corporation intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the subordinated notes for general corporate purposes, which may include investments at the holding company level, providing capital to support the growth of FNBPA and its business, repurchases of its common shares and the payment of the cash consideration components of future acquisitions. 

&#160;

Business Segments 

In addition to the following information relating to the Corporation&#146;s business segments, more detailed information is contained in the Business Segments footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had four business segments, with the largest being the Community Banking segment consisting of a regional community bank. The Wealth Management segment consists of a trust company, a registered investment advisor and a subsidiary that offers broker-dealer services through a third party networking arrangement with a non-affiliated licensed broker-dealer entity. The Insurance segment consists of an insurance agency and a reinsurer. The Consumer Finance segment consists of a multi-state consumer finance company. 

Community Banking 

The Corporation&#146;s Community Banking segment consists of First National Bank of Pennsylvania (FNBPA), which offers services traditionally offered by full-service commercial banks, including commercial and individual demand, savings and time deposit accounts and commercial, mortgage and individual installment loans. As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation operated its Community Banking business through a network of 288 branches in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia. 

The goals of Community Banking are to generate high-quality, profitable revenue growth through increased business with its current customers, attract new customer relationships through FNBPA&#146;s current branches and expand into new and existing markets through de novo branch openings, acquisitions and the establishment of loan production offices. The Corporation considers Community Banking an important source of revenue opportunity through the cross-selling of products and services offered by the Corporation&#146;s other business segments. 

The lending philosophy of Community Banking is to establish high-quality customer relationships, while minimizing credit losses by following strict credit approval standards (which include independent analysis of realizable collateral value), diversifying its loan portfolio by industry and borrower and conducting ongoing review and management of the loan portfolio. Commercial loans are generally made to established businesses within the geographic market areas served by Community Banking. 

No material portion of the loans or deposits of Community Banking has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer&#146;s loans or deposits or a small group of customers&#146; loans or deposits by Community Banking would not have a material adverse effect on the Community Banking segment or on the Corporation. The substantial majority of the loans and deposits have been generated within the geographic market areas in which Community Banking operates. 

Wealth Management 

The Corporation&#146;s Wealth Management segment delivers wealth management services to individuals, corporations and retirement funds, as well as existing customers of Community Banking, located primarily within the Corporation&#146;s geographic markets. 

The Corporation&#146;s Wealth Management operations are conducted through three subsidiaries of FNBPA. First National Trust Company (FNTC) provides a broad range of personal and corporate fiduciary services, including the administration of decedent and trust estates. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of trust assets under management was approximately $3.7 billion. FNTC is required to maintain certain minimum capitalization levels in accordance with regulatory requirements. FNTC periodically measures its capital position to ensure all minimum capitalization levels are maintained. 

The Corporation&#146;s Wealth Management segment also includes two other subsidiaries. First National Investment Services Company, LLC (FNIS) offers a broad array of investment products and services for 

&#160;

customers of Wealth Management through a networking relationship with a third-party licensed brokerage firm. F.N.B. Investment Advisors, Inc. (FNBIA), an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offers customers of Wealth Management comprehensive investment programs featuring mutual funds, annuities, stocks and bonds. 

No material portion of the business of Wealth Management has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer&#146;s business or the business of a small group of customers by Wealth Management would not have a material adverse effect on the Wealth Management segment or on the Corporation. 

Insurance 

The Corporation&#146;s Insurance segment operates principally through FNIA, which is a subsidiary of the Corporation. FNIA is a full-service insurance brokerage agency offering numerous lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers to businesses and individuals primarily within the Corporation&#146;s geographic markets. The goal of FNIA is to grow revenue through cross-selling to existing clients of Community Banking and to gain new clients through its own channels. 

The Corporation&#146;s Insurance segment also includes a reinsurance subsidiary, Penn-Ohio Life Insurance Company (Penn-Ohio). Penn-Ohio underwrites, as a reinsurer, credit life and accident and health insurance sold by the Corporation&#146;s lending subsidiaries. Additionally, FNBPA owns a direct subsidiary, First National Corporation, which offers title insurance products. 

No material portion of the business of Insurance has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer&#146;s business or the business of a small group of customers by Insurance would not have a material adverse effect on the Insurance segment or on the Corporation. 

Consumer Finance 

The Corporation&#146;s Consumer Finance segment operates through its subsidiary, Regency Finance Company (Regency), which is involved principally in making personal installment loans to individuals and purchasing installment sales finance contracts from retail merchants. Such activity is primarily funded through the sale at Regency&#146;s branch offices of subordinated notes which are issued by one of the Corporation&#146;s indirect subsidiaries, FNB Financial Services, LP, and guaranteed by the Corporation. The Consumer Finance segment operates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky. 

No material portion of the business of Consumer Finance has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer&#146;s business or the business of a small group of customers by Consumer Finance would not have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Finance segment or on the Corporation. 

Other 

The Corporation also operates other non-banking subsidiaries. F.N.B. Capital Corporation, LLC (FNBCC) was formed as a merchant banking subsidiary to offer mezzanine financing options for small- to medium-sized businesses that need financial assistance beyond the parameters of typical commercial bank lending products. FNBCC ceased financing new portfolio companies in July 2013. FNBCC has a 21.9% funding commitment in F.N.B. Capital Partners, L.P. (FNBCP), a Small Business Investment Company licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the Corporation licensed FNBCP to use its name). FNBCP, which is not an affiliate or a subsidiary of the Corporation, was formed by former employees of FNBCC. F.N.B. Statutory Trust II and Omega Financial Capital Trust I issued TPS to third-party investors. Regency Consumer Financial Services, Inc. and FNB Consumer Financial Services, Inc. are the general partner and limited partner, respectively, of FNB Financial Services, LP, the company established to issue, administer and repay the subordinated notes through which loans in the Consumer Finance segment are funded. Additionally, Bank 

&#160;

Capital Services, LLC, a subsidiary of FNBPA, offers commercial loans and leases to customers in need of new or used equipment. Certain financial information concerning these subsidiaries, along with the parent company and intercompany eliminations, are included in the &#147;Parent and Other&#148; category in the Business Segments footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Market Area and Competition 

The Corporation operates in Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and northern West Virginia, which are areas with relatively stable markets and modest growth. Additionally, the Corporation operates in the Baltimore, Maryland Metropolitan Statistical Area and Montgomery County, Maryland, which are relatively higher growth markets. In addition to Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Corporation&#146;s Consumer Finance segment also operates in northern and central Tennessee and western and central Kentucky. 

The Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries compete for loans, deposits and financial services business with a large number of other financial institutions, many of which offer such services through the internet and mobile devices. Competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial services companies. The most direct competition for deposits historically comes from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. Additional competition for deposits comes from non-depositary competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. In providing wealth and asset management services, as well as insurance brokerage services, the Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries compete with many other financial services firms, brokerage firms, mutual fund complexes, investment management firms, trust and fiduciary service providers and insurance agencies. 

In Regency&#146;s market areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky, its active competitors include banks, credit unions and national, regional and local consumer finance companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than that of Regency. The ready availability of consumer credit through charge accounts and credit cards constitutes additional competition. In this market area, competition is based on the rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid to obtain funds and the availability of customer services. 

The ability to deploy and use technology effectively is an important competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology is not only important with respect to delivery of financial services and protection of the security of customer information, but also in processing information. The Corporation and each of its subsidiaries must continually make technological investments to remain competitive in the financial services industry. FNBPA is currently executing several initiatives under its retail delivery strategy that are designed to integrate and streamline FNBPA&#146;s physical branch and e-delivery channels. 

Underwriting 

Commercial Loans 

The Corporation&#146;s Credit Policy requires, among other things, that all commercial loans be underwritten to document the borrower&#146;s financial capacity to support the cash flow required to repay the loan. The Credit Policy also contains additional guidelines and requirements applicable to specific loan products or lines of business. The Corporation has developed a proprietary underwriting system for all corporate business loan relationships and utilizes a third party solution for small business loan relationships, with both platforms allowing for consistency in underwriting across the entire footprint that also generally permits credit decisions at the local and regional level. As part of this underwriting, the Corporation requires clear and concise documentation of the borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan based on current financial statements and/or tax returns, plus pro-forma financial statements, as appropriate. Specific guidelines for loan terms and conditions are outlined in the Corporation&#146;s Credit Policy. The guidelines also detail the collateral requirements for various loan types. It is the Corporation&#146;s general practice to obtain personal guarantees, supported by current personal financial statements and/or tax returns, to reduce the credit risk, as appropriate. 

&#160;

For loans secured by commercial real estate, the Corporation obtains current and independent appraisals from licensed or certified appraisers to assess the value of the underlying collateral. The Corporation&#146;s general policy for commercial real estate loans is to limit the terms of the loans to not more than 15 years and to have loan-to-value (LTV) ratios not exceeding 80% on owner-occupied and income producing properties. For non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, the loan terms are generally aligned with the property&#146;s lease terms, and in many instances, these loans mature within 5 years. The Corporation&#146;s Credit Policy also delineates similar guidelines for maximum terms and acceptable advance rates for loans that are not secured by real estate. 

Consumer Loans 

The Corporation&#146;s revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOC) are generally variable rate loans underwritten based on fully indexed rates. For home equity loans, the Corporation&#146;s policy is to generally require a LTV ratio not in excess of 85% and FICO scores of not less than 660. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will extend credit to borrowers with a LTV ratio over 85% on a limited and closely monitored basis. The Corporation&#146;s underwriters evaluate a borrower&#146;s debt service capacity on all line of credit applications by utilizing an interest shock rate of 3% over the prevailing variable interest rate at origination. The borrower&#146;s debt-to-income ratio must remain within the Corporation&#146;s guidelines under the shock rate repayment formula. The Corporation has elected, with the onset of the qualified mortgage (QM) rules established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2014, to tightly limit the origination of non-QM loans. 

The Corporation&#146;s policy for its indirect installment loans, which third parties (primarily auto dealers) originate, is to require a minimum FICO score of 640 for the borrower, the age of the vehicle not to exceed 7 years or 100,000 miles and an appropriate LTV ratio, not to exceed 115% inclusive of back-end added products, based on the year and make of the vehicle financed. 

The Corporation structures its consumer loan products to meet the diverse credit needs of consumers in the Corporation&#146;s market for personal and household purposes. These loan products are on a fixed amount or revolving basis depending on customer need and borrowing capacity. The Corporation&#146;s loans and lines of credit attempt to balance borrower budgeting sensitivities with realistic repayment maturities within a philosophy that encourages consumer financial responsibility, sound credit risk management and development of strong customer relationships. 

The Corporation&#146;s consumer loan policies and procedures require prospective borrowers to provide appropriate and accurate financial information that will enable the Corporation&#146;s loan underwriting personnel to make credit decisions. Specific information requirements vary based on loan type, risk profile and secondary investor requirements where applicable. In all extensions of credit, however, the Corporation insists on evidence of capacity as well as an independent credit report to assess the prospective borrower&#146;s willingness and ability to repay the debt. If any information submitted by the prospective borrower raises reasonable doubts with respect to the willingness and ability of the borrower to repay the loan, the Corporation denies the credit. The Corporation does not provide loans in which there is no verification of the prospective borrower&#146;s income. The Corporation does not make interest-only or similar type residential mortgage loans. 

The Corporation often takes collateral to support an extension of credit and to provide additional protection should the primary source of repayment fail. Consequently, the Corporation limits unsecured extensions of credit in amount and only grants them to borrowers with adequate capacity and above-average credit profiles. The Corporation expressly discourages unsecured credit lines for debt consolidation unless there is compelling evidence that the borrower has sufficient liquidity and net worth to repay the loan from alternative sources in the event of income disruption. 

The Corporation generally obtains full independent appraisals of residential real estate collateral values on residential mortgage applications of $100,000 and greater. The Corporation may use algorithm-based 

&#160;

valuation models for residential mortgages under $100,000. The Corporation recognizes the limitations as well as the benefits of these valuation products. The Corporation&#146;s policy is to be conservative in their use but fluid and flexible in interpreting reasonable collateral values when obtained. 

The Corporation monitors consumer loans with exceptions to its policy including, but not limited to, LTV ratios, FICO scores and debt-to-income ratios. Management routinely evaluates the type, nature, trend and scope of these exceptions and reacts through policy changes, lender counseling, adjustment of loan authorities and similar prerogatives to assure that the retail assets generated meet acceptable credit quality standards. As an added precaution, the Corporation&#146;s risk management personnel conduct periodic reviews of loan files. 

Regency Finance Company Loans 

Regency originates three general types of loans: direct real estate, direct non-real estate and indirect sales finance. Regency has written policies and procedures that it distributes to each Regency branch office defining underwriting, pricing and loan servicing guidelines. Regency issues written credit authority limits based upon the individual loan underwriter&#146;s capability. On a monthly basis, Regency evaluates specific metrics relating to Regency&#146;s origination and servicing of its loan portfolio. Regency also uses a quality control program to review, in an independent manner, loan origination and servicing on a monthly basis to ensure adherence with compliance and credit criteria standards. 

Regency evaluates each applicant for credit on an individual basis measuring attributes derived from the review of credit reports, income verification and collateral, if applicable, with product-specific underwriting standards. Regency utilizes a prospective borrower&#146;s reported income to derive debt-to-income ratios that permit Regency to follow a conservative approach in evaluating a potential borrower&#146;s ability to pay debt service. 

Regency underwrites direct real estate loans utilizing a risk-based pricing matrix that evaluates the applicants by FICO score, credit criteria and LTV ratio. First lien general LTV standards permit a maximum of 85% of appraised value. Regency does not offer variable rate real estate secured loans. Regency does not offer unverified or no documentation loans. 

Regency underwrites direct financing for automobile secured loans utilizing a risk-based pricing matrix that evaluates the applicants by FICO score, credit criteria and advance rate as a percentage of the book value of the vehicle. Regency will only grant credit secured by an automobile at the current (time of application) National Automobile Dealers Association Book retail price. 

Regency generates indirect sales finance applications and subsequent loans through dealers that Regency approves for the purpose of the customer&#146;s finance of a purchase such as furniture or windows. Regency grants credit in a similar manner as set forth above for direct real estate loans. Pricing parameters are generally dealer and geographic specific. Regency underwrites direct non-real estate personal and secured loans represented above with the exception that this product does not rely on FICO scores. Specific analysis of the applicant&#146;s credit report and income verification are the principal elements of Regency&#146;s credit decision with respect to direct non-real estate personal and secured loans. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 2,747 full-time and 458 part-time employees. Management of the Corporation considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory. 

Government Supervision and Regulation 

The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and financial holding companies and their banking subsidiaries and to companies 

&#160;

engaged in the same types of securities and insurance activities as the Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about the Corporation. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors through the federal deposit insurance guarantee, and not for the protection of security holders. Numerous laws and regulations govern the operations of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to the Corporation and its affiliates are described in this section. Such descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies referenced herein. In addition, certain of the Corporation&#146;s public disclosure, internal control environment, risk and capital management and corporate governance principles are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and related regulations and rules of the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Corporation&#146;s common stock and Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) under the trading symbols &#147;FNB&#148; and &#147;FNBPrE,&#148; respectively, and the Corporation is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) could materially adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s financial condition or results of operations. As a financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of the Corporation&#146;s business, it faces increased complexity and additional costs in its compliance efforts. 

General 

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a financial holding company and a bank holding company, the Corporation is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and is subject to regulation, inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). The Corporation is also subject to regulation by the SEC as a result of the Corporation&#146;s status as a public company and due to the nature of the business activities of certain of the Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries. 

The FRB is the &#147;umbrella&#148; regulator of a financial holding company. In addition, a financial holding company&#146;s operating entities, such as its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment managers, investment companies, insurance companies and banks, are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state &#147;functional&#148; regulators. 

The Corporation&#146;s subsidiary bank, FNBPA, and FNBPA&#146;s subsidiary trust company, FNTC, are organized as national banking associations, which are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (UST). FNBPA is also subject to certain regulatory requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB and other federal and state regulatory agencies, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, capital requirements, limitations regarding dividends, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged on loans, inter-affiliate transactions, monitoring obligations under the federal bank secrecy act and anti-money laundering requirements, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may be engaged in and types of services that may be offered. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to various other laws and regulations and supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of the Corporation and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. If the Corporation fails to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, it may be subject to civil monetary penalties, imposition of cease and desist orders or other written directives, removal of management and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. 

Pursuant to the GLB Act, bank holding companies such as the Corporation that have qualified as financial holding companies because they are &#147;well-capitalized&#148; and &#147;well managed&#148; have broad authority to engage in 

&#160;

activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, including insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making; and such additional activities as the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the UST determines to be financial in nature, incidental thereto or complementary to a financial activity. The GLB Act repealed or modified a number of significant statutory provisions, including those of the Glass-Steagall Act and the BHC Act, which had previously restricted banking organizations&#146; ability to engage in certain types of business activities (subsequently further modified by the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed below). As a result of the GLB Act, a bank holding company may engage in those activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; A financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature, either de novo or by acquisition, provided the financial holding company continues such status and gives the FRB after-the-fact notice of the new activities. The GLB Act also permits national banks, such as FNBPA, to engage in activities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC. 

As a regulated financial holding company, the Corporation&#146;s relationships and good standing with its regulators are of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of the Corporation&#146;s businesses. The FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFPB and SEC have broad enforcement powers and authority to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of the Corporation or its subsidiaries to open new or close existing offices, conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations. In addition, the Corporation, FNBPA, FNTC and other affiliates are subject to examination by the various regulators, which results in examination reports (which are not publicly available) and ratings that can impact the conduct and growth of the Corporation&#146;s businesses. These examinations consider not only safety and soundness principles, but also compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including bank secrecy and anti-money laundering requirements, loan quality and administration, capital levels, asset quality and risk management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, consumer compliance, community reinvestment and various other factors. An examination downgrade by any of the Corporation&#146;s federal bank regulators could potentially result in the imposition of significant limitations and prohibitions on the activities and growth of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

There are numerous laws, regulations and rules governing the activities of financial institutions, financial holding companies and bank holding companies. The following discussion is general in nature and seeks to highlight some of the more significant of these regulatory requirements, but does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry by introducing significant regulatory and compliance changes including, among other things, 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; &#160; &#149; &#160; increased capital and liquidity requirements; &#160; &#149; &#160; increased regulatory examination fees; &#160; &#149; &#160; increases to the assessments banks must pay the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and &#160; &#149; &#160; specific provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that is enforced by new and existing federal regulatory agencies and authorities, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), FRB, OCC, FDIC and CFPB. The following description briefly summarizes certain impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on the operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) are calculated. Under the amendments, the FDIC assessment base is no longer the institution&#146;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, requiring the minimum to be increased from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020, and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds, leaving the designated reserve ratio to the discretion of the FDIC, which has set 2% as the designated reserve ratio. Several of these provisions have increased, and may continue to increase, the FDIC deposit insurance premiums FNBPA pays. 

Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act permits depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits. In accordance therewith, the Corporation pays interest on certain classes of commercial demand deposits. 

Trust Preferred Securities. Pursuant to Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Volcker Rule), the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules which permits banking entities with consolidated assets less than $15 billion to continue to retain interests in TPS as tier 1 capital provided the TPS was established, and interest was issued prior to May 19, 2010, the banking entity reasonably believes the offering proceeds received by the TPS were invested in certain qualifying TPS collateral and the banking entity&#146;s interest in the TPS was acquired prior to December 31, 2013. In addition, the interim final rules provide that for banking entities with $15 billion or more in consolidated assets, TPS will, on a phased-out basis, no longer qualify as tier 1 capital after January 1, 2016 (see discussion under the captions, &#147; Capital and Operational Requirements &#148; and &#147; Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision &#148;). 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent CFPB within the FRB. The CFPB&#146;s responsibility is to establish, implement and enforce rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of both bank and non-bank providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes that govern products and services banks offer to consumers. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, discriminatory, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general will have the authority to enforce consumer protection rules that the CFPB adopts against state-chartered institutions and against, with respect to certain non-preempted laws, national banks. Compliance with any such new regulations established by the CFPB and/or states could reduce the Corporation&#146;s revenue, increase its cost of operations, and limit its ability to expand into certain products and services. 

Debit Card Interchange Fees . On June 29, 2011, the FRB, pursuant to its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act, issued rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion, adopting a per-transaction interchange cap base of $0.21 plus a 5-basis point fraud loss adjustment per transaction. Following completion of the Corporation&#146;s acquisition of Parkvale on January 1, 2012, the Corporation&#146;s assets exceeded the $10 billion threshold. As a result, the Corporation became subject to the new rules regarding debit card interchange fees as of July 1, 2013. 

Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#147;covered transactions&#148; to include the borrowing or lending of securities or derivative transactions, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 

Certain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from FNBPA) between FNBPA and the Corporation and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral 

&#160;

requirements, and other restrictions imposed by statute and FRB regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arm&#146;s-length basis. These restrictions generally do not apply to transactions between FNBPA and its direct wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

Transactions with Insiders. The Dodd-Frank Act expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and extending the types of transactions subject to the various requirements to include derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also places restrictions on certain asset sales to and from an insider of an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, receive the approval of the institution&#146;s board of directors. 

Enhanced Lending Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution&#146;s credit exposure to one borrower. Federal banking law currently limits a national bank&#146;s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons to an amount that does not exceed certain thresholds. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 

Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Corporation. The Dodd-Frank Act: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; &#160; &#149; &#160; enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; and &#160; &#149; &#160; requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt clawback policies for incentive-based compensation plans applicable to executive officers. Although many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented there still remain a number of its requirements that will be implemented over time. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the federal banking agencies may implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the full extent of the impact such requirements may have on the Corporation&#146;s compliance responsibilities, operations and the financial services markets is unclear at this time. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the Corporation&#146;s profitability, require changes to certain of the Corporation&#146;s business practices, including limitations on fee income opportunities, increased compliance costs, imposition of more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements upon the Corporation or otherwise adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s business. These changes may also require the Corporation to continue to invest significant management attention and compliance, legal, risk and audit resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. The Corporation cannot predict what effect any newly implemented, presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on the Corporation. 

Capital and Operational Requirements 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels, due to its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. 

The FRB&#146;s risk-based guidelines are based on a three-tier capital framework. Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders&#146; equity and qualifying preferred stock, less goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier 1 capital, mandatory convertible debt, limited amounts of subordinated debt, other qualifying term debt and the allowance for credit losses of up to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets. Tier 3 capital includes subordinated debt that is unsecured, fully paid, and has an original maturity of at least two years, is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval by the FRB and includes a lock-in clause precluding payment of either interest of principal if the payment would cause the issuing bank&#146;s risk-based capital ratio to fall or remain below the required minimum. 

&#160;

The Corporation, like other bank holding companies, through December 31, 2015 was required to maintain tier 1 capital and total capital (the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of its total risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance sheet items). Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation&#146;s tier 1 and total capital ratios under these guidelines were 10.4% and 12.9%, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation had $14.4 million of capital securities that qualified as tier 1 capital and $163.1 million of capital securities and subordinated debt that qualified as tier 2 capital. 

In addition, the FRB has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines currently provide for a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to average total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the leverage ratio), of 3.0% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Further, the FRB has indicated that it will consider a &#147;tangible tier 1 capital leverage ratio&#148; (deducting all intangibles) and all other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The Corporation&#146;s leverage ratio at December 31, 2015 was 8.1%. 

Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision 

The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a series of more onerous capital requirements on financial companies and other companies, including swap dealers and non-bank financial companies that are determined to be of systemic risk. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce the Corporation&#146;s ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. 

The Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s new regulatory capital requirements are intended to ensure that &#147;financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during future periods of financial distress.&#148; The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions, their holding companies and non-bank financial companies that have been determined to be systemically significant by the FSOC. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that, at a minimum, regulators apply to bank holding companies and other systemically significant non-bank financial companies the same capital and risk standards that such regulators apply to banks insured by the FDIC. An important consequence of this requirement is that hybrid capital instruments, such as TPS, will no longer be included in the definition of tier 1 capital after December 31, 2015, for banking entities with over $15 billion in consolidated assets. Tier 1 capital includes common stock, retained earnings, certain types of preferred stock and TPS. Since TPS are not currently counted as tier 1 capital for insured banks, the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act is that such securities will no longer be included as tier 1 capital for bank holding companies or financial holding companies. Excluding TPS from tier 1 capital could significantly decrease regulatory capital levels of holding companies that have traditionally relied on TPS to meet capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements may force bank holding companies to raise other forms of tier 1 capital, for example, by issuing perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock. Since common stock must typically constitute at least 50 percent of tier 1 capital, many bank holding companies and systemically significant non-bank companies may consider dilutive follow-on offerings of common stock, such as that executed by the Corporation in November 2013. 

&#160;

In order to ease the compliance burden associated with the new capital requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a number of exceptions and phase-in periods. For bank holding companies with over $15 billion in consolidated assets and systemically important non-bank financial companies, any &#147;regulatory capital deductions&#148; for debt or equity issued before May 19, 2010 was phased in incrementally from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2016. The term &#147;regulatory capital deductions&#148; refers to the exclusion of hybrid capital from tier 1 capital. On a fully phased-in basis under these new standards, the Corporation continues to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements. 

Basel III Capital Rules 

In July 2013, the Corporation&#146;s and FNBPA&#146;s primary federal regulator, the FRB, published the Basel III Capital Rules (Basel III) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#146;s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Corporation and FNBPA, compared to the then-existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. Basel III defines the components of capital and addresses other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. Basel III also addresses risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in a banking institution&#146;s regulatory capital ratios and replaces the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. Basel III also implements the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#146; rules. Basel III became effective for the Corporation and FNBPA on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). 

Basel III, among other things, (i) introduces a new capital measure called &#147;Common Equity Tier 1&#148; (CET1), (ii) specifies that tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#147;Additional Tier 1&#148; capital instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Basel III will require the Corporation and FNBPA to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority&#146;s risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 

Basel III also provides for a &#147;countercyclical capital buffer&#148; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Corporation or FNBPA. 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation depending on the amount of the shortfall. 

&#160;

Under Basel III, the initial minimum capital ratios that became effective on January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; &#160; &#149; &#160; 6.0% tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; &#160; &#149; &#160; 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets; and &#160; &#149; &#160; 4.0% tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets. Basel III provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under capital standards in effect as of December 31, 2014, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, banking organizations which do not use the advanced approach, such as the Corporation and FNBPA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Corporation and FNBPA made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Corporation&#146;s available-for-sale securities portfolio. Basel III also precludes certain hybrid securities, such as TPS, as tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. TPS no longer included in the Corporation&#146;s tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (starting at 40% on January 1, 2015, with an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

With respect to FNBPA, Basel III also revises the &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under &#147;Prompt Corrective Action.&#148; 

Basel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the rules impacting the Corporation&#146;s determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans; &#160; &#149; &#160; assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due; &#160; &#149; &#160; providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); &#160; &#149; &#160; providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction; &#160; &#149; &#160; providing for a 100% risk weight for claims on securities firms; &#160; &#149; &#160; eliminating the current 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives. In addition, Basel III provides more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increases the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

&#160;

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Corporation and FNBPA meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements had been in effect. 

Stress Testing 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB and OCC published final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The rules require institutions, such as, the Corporation and FNBPA, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. Implementation of the rules for covered institutions with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion began in 2013. The stress test rules and guidance require increased involvement by boards of directors in the stress testing process and public disclosure of the results. The company-run stress tests were conducted using data as of September 30, 2014 and 2013 and scenarios released by the agencies. Stress test results must be reported to the agencies by the following March 31 st . Public disclosure of summary stress test results under the severely adverse scenario began in June 2015 for stress tests commencing in 2014. The next public disclosure of the Corporations&#146; stress testing results using data as of December 31, 2015 will be in June 2016. The Corporation&#146;s capital ratios reflected in the stress test calculations are an important factor considered by the FRB in evaluating the capital adequacy of the Corporation and FNBPA and whether the appropriateness of any proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound practice. In reviewing the Corporation&#146;s and FNBPA&#146;s stress test results, the FRB and OCC will consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. 

Liquidity Requirements 

Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. Liquidity risk management has become increasingly important since the financial crisis. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#146;s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are designed to incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. 

In September 2014, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which apply to the Corporation or FNBPA. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR or addressed the scope of bank organizations to which it will apply. The Basel Committee&#146;s final NSFR document states that the NSFR applies to internationally active banks, as did its final LCR document as to the ratio. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, classifies insured depository institutions into five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; for insured depository 

&#160;

institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital-raising requirements, restrictions on its business and a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and in certain circumstances the appointment of a conservator or receiver. An &#147;undercapitalized&#148; bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank&#146;s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank&#146;s assets at the time it became &#147;undercapitalized&#148; or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, the obligation under such guarantee would take priority over the parent&#146;s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards. 

The various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA, using the total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures. Such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a &#147;well-capitalized&#148; institution must have a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to a capital directive order. Under these guidelines, FNBPA was considered well-capitalized as of December 31, 2015. 

When determining the adequacy of an institution&#146;s capital, federal regulators must also take into consideration (a) concentrations of credit risk; (b) interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution&#146;s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance sheet position) and (c) risks from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution&#146;s ability to manage those risks. This evaluation is made as part of the institution&#146;s regular safety and soundness examination. In addition, the Corporation, and any bank with significant trading activity, must incorporate a measure for market risk in their regulatory capital calculations. 

Expanded FDIC Powers Upon Insolvency of Insured Depository Institutions 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for appointing the FDIC as receiver for a financial company if the failure of the company and its liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency procedures would pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the U.S. 

If appointed as receiver for a failing financial company for which a systemic risk determination has been made, the FDIC has broad authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Orderly Liquidation Authority it created to operate or liquidate the business, sell the assets, and resolve the liabilities of the company immediately after its appointment as receiver or as soon as conditions make this appropriate. This authority will enable the FDIC to act immediately to sell assets of the company to another entity or, if that is not possible, to create a bridge financial company to maintain critical functions as the entity is wound down. In receiverships of insured depository institutions, the ability to act quickly and decisively has been found to reduce losses to creditors while maintaining key banking services for depositors and businesses. The FDIC will similarly be able to act quickly in resolving non-bank financial companies under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The FDIC Office of Complex Financial Institutions is responsible for implementing its expanded responsibilities attendant to its new receivership authority. The FDIC adopted five major rules for the implementation of its new receivership authority. 

&#160;

Subject to these new rules, if the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; transfer any of the depository institution&#146;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution&#146;s creditors; &#160; &#149; &#160; enforce the terms of the depository institution&#146;s contracts pursuant to their terms; and &#160; &#149; &#160; repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution. Also, under applicable law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC, as subrogee of the depositors) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution. As a result, whether or not the FDIC would ever seek to repudiate any obligations held by public note holders, such persons would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than the depositors of the depository institution. Interstate Banking 

Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies, including those that are also financial holding companies, are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB (unless waived by the FRB) before acquiring more than five percent of any class of voting stock of any non-affiliated bank. Pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Banking Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisitions under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, after the proposed acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. 

The Dodd-Frank Act confers on state and national banks the ability to branch de novo into any state, provided that the law of that state permits a bank chartered in that state to establish a branch at that same location. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to and investments in low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#147;satisfactory&#148; in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction. 

Financial Privacy 

In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow 

&#160;

consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA PATRIOT Act 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The UST has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act to financial institutions such as FNBPA. These regulations require financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, including criminal law enforcement, and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The U.S. has instituted economic sanctions which affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC rules&#148; because they are administered by the UST Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The OFAC-administered sanctions target countries in various ways. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country, and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions which relate to investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Consumer Protection Statutes and Regulations 

In addition to the consumer regulations that may be issued by the CFPB pursuant to its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act, FNBPA is subject to various federal consumer protection statutes and regulations including the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Among other things, these acts: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; require banks to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways; &#160; &#149; &#160; prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction; &#160; &#149; &#160; prohibit discrimination in housing-related lending activities; &#160; &#149; &#160; require banks to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects; &#160; &#149; &#160; require lenders to provide borrowers with more detailed information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements; &#160; &#149; &#160; prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions; &#160; &#149; &#160; prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations and &#160; &#149; &#160; prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in connection with consumer loans. &#160;

The CFPB has implemented a series of final consumer protection and disclosure rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing designed to address the Dodd-Frank Act mortgage lending protections. In particular, the CFPB issued a rule implementing the ability-to-repay and QM provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the QM Rule). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of &#147;qualified mortgage&#148; are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a &#147;qualified mortgage&#148; incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet underwriting guidelines of U.S. government-sponsored entities, the Federal Housing Administration and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. The QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014. Additionally, regulations governing the servicing of residential mortgages that became effective in January 2014 have placed additional requirements on mortgage servicers that often lengthen the process for foreclosing on residential mortgages. 

The Corporation is still evaluating the impact of the rules recently issued by the CFPB to determine if they will have any long-term impact on its mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will likely increase the Corporation&#146;s overall regulatory compliance costs and decrease fee income opportunities. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Corporation&#146;s primary source of funds for cash distributions to its stockholders, and funds used to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness, is dividends received from FNBPA. FNBPA is subject to federal laws and regulations governing its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of its net income for the current year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank if it determines such payment would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In addition to dividends from FNBPA, other sources of parent company liquidity for the Corporation include cash and short-term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries. 

In addition, the ability of the Corporation and FNBPA to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under FDICIA, as described above. The right of the Corporation, its stockholders and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries. 

Source of Strength 

According to the Dodd-Frank Act and FRB policy, a financial or bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Consistent with the &#147;source of strength&#148; policy, the FRB has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank or financial holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the Corporation&#146;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. This support may be required at times when the parent holding company may not be able to provide such support. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or 

&#160;

anticipated by the FDIC either as a result of default of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of default, the other banks that are within the same holding company family as the distressed bank that are members of the FDIC may be assessed for the FDIC&#146;s loss, subject to certain exceptions. 

In addition, if FNBPA was no longer &#147;well-capitalized&#148; and &#147;well-managed&#148; within the meaning of the BHC Act and FRB rules (which take into consideration capital ratios, examination ratings and other factors), the expedited processing of certain types of FRB applications would not be available to the Corporation. Moreover, examination ratings of &#147;3&#148; or lower, &#147;unsatisfactory&#148; ratings, capital ratios below well-capitalized levels, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in the loss of financial holding company status, practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank (or financial) holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends or continue to conduct existing activities. 

Financial Holding Company Status and Activities 

Under the BHC Act, an eligible bank holding company may elect to be a &#147;financial holding company&#148; and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for banks and bank holding companies. The Corporation is a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The financial holding company may engage directly or through a subsidiary in certain statutorily authorized activities (subject to certain restrictions and limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act). A financial holding company may also engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior FRB approval) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution or to the financial system generally. In addition to these activities, a financial holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 

For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; and &#147;well-managed.&#148; The FRB generally must deny expanded authority to any bank holding company with a subsidiary insured depository institution that received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent CRA review as of the time it submits its request for financial holding company status. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company under the BHC Act, the company fails to continue to meet any of the requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 

Activities and Acquisitions 

The BHC Act requires a bank or financial holding company to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the company may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than five percent of any class of voting securities of the institution; &#160; &#149; &#160; any of the company&#146;s subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or &#160; &#149; &#160; the company may merge or consolidate with any other bank or financial holding company. &#160;

The Interstate Banking Act generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a holding company of banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank; &#160; &#149; &#160; a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank; and &#160; &#149; &#160; a bank to establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the host state permits de novo branching of its own state-chartered banks. Bank or financial holding companies and banks seeking to engage in mergers authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be at least adequately capitalized as of the date that the application is filed, and the resulting institution must be well-capitalized and managed upon consummation of the transaction. 

The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert, from acquiring &#147;control&#148; of a bank holding company or bank unless the FRB has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction. Under FRB regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more (but less than 25%) of the voting stock of a corporation would, under the circumstances set forth in the regulations, create a rebuttable presumption of acquisition of control of the corporation. 

Securities and Exchange Commission 

The Corporation is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of the Corporation&#146;s status as a public company and due to the nature of the business activities of certain subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the SEC&#146;s jurisdiction over hedge funds, credit ratings agencies and governance of public companies, among other areas, and enhanced the SEC&#146;s enforcement powers. Several of the provisions could lead to significant changes in SEC enforcement practice and may have long-term implications for public companies, their officers and employees, accountants, brokerage firms, investment advisers and persons associated with them. For example, these provisions (1) authorize new rewards to and provide expanded protections of whistleblowers; (2) provide the SEC authority to impose substantial civil penalties on all persons subject to cease-and-desist proceedings, not merely securities brokers, investment advisers and their associated persons; (3) broaden standards for the imposition of secondary liability; (4) confer on the SEC extraterritorial jurisdiction over alleged fraud violations involving conduct abroad and enhancing the ability of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to inspect audit work by foreign public accounting firms; and (5) expand the applicability of collateral bars. 

SOX contains important requirements for public companies in the areas of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with section 302(a) of SOX, written certifications by the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are required with respect to each of the Corporation&#146;s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC. These certifications attest that the applicable report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The Corporation also maintains a program designed to comply with Section 404 of SOX, which includes identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design of process and entity level controls and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Report for the Corporation&#146;s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures. 

FNBIA is registered with the SEC as an investment advisor and, therefore, is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the SEC&#146;s regulations thereunder. The principal purpose of the regulations applicable to investment advisors is the protection of investment advisory clients and the securities markets, rather than the protection of creditors and stockholders of investment advisors. The regulations applicable to investment advisors cover all aspects of the investment advisory business, including limitations on the ability of investment advisors to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients, record-keeping, 

&#160;

operating, marketing and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on principal transactions between an advisor or its affiliates and advisory clients, as well as other anti-fraud prohibitions. FNBIA also may be subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. 

Additional legislation, changes in or new rules promulgated by the SEC and other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of FNBIA. The profitability of FNBIA could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation, homeland security and electronic commerce. 

Under various provisions of the federal and state securities laws, including in particular those applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisors and registered investment companies and their service providers, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in a limitation of permitted activities and disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities. 

FNBIA also may be required to conduct its business in a manner that complies with rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), among others. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of clients and plan assets and beneficiaries, rather than the protection of stockholders and creditors. 

Consumer Finance Subsidiary 

Regency is subject to regulation under Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky state laws that require, among other things, that it maintain licenses in effect for consumer finance operations for each of its offices. Representatives of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions periodically visit Regency&#146;s offices and conduct extensive examinations in order to determine compliance with such laws and regulations. Additionally, the FRB, as &#147;umbrella&#148; regulator of the Corporation pursuant to the GLB Act, may conduct an examination of Regency&#146;s offices or operations. Such examinations include a review of loans and the collateral securing those loans, as well as a check of the procedures employed for making and collecting loans. Additionally, Regency is under the jurisdiction of the CFPB and is subject to certain federal consumer protection laws that require that certain information relating to credit terms be disclosed to customers and, in certain instances, afford customers the right to rescind transactions. The CFPB may also periodically visit Regency&#146;s offices and conduct extensive consumer protection examinations. As a Pennsylvania corporation, Regency is subject to Pennsylvania&#146;s requirements concerning dividend payments. 

Insurance Agencies 

FNIA is subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the various states in which FNIA conducts business. These laws and regulations are primarily for the benefit of policyholders. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, those authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including for regulatory violations or upon conviction for certain crimes. Possible sanctions that may be imposed for violation of regulations include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time, revocation of licenses, censures and fines. 

Penn-Ohio is subject to examination by the Arizona Department of Insurance. Representatives of the Arizona Department of Insurance periodically determine whether Penn-Ohio has maintained required reserves, established adequate deposits under a reinsurance agreement and complied with reporting requirements under the applicable Arizona statutes. 

&#160;

Governmental Policies 

The operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates monetary policy and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of all financial institutions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
