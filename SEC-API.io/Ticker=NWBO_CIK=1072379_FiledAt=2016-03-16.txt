 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company focused on developing immunotherapy products to treat cancers more effectively than current treatments, without toxicities of the kind associated with chemotherapies, and, through a proprietary batch manufacturing process, on a cost-effective basis, initially in both the United States and Europe (the two largest medical markets in the world).

&#160;

We have developed a platform technology, DCVax, which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient's own immune system to attack their cancer. The DCVax technology is expected to be applicable to all solid tumor cancers, and is embodied in several distinct product lines. One of the product lines (DCVax-L) is designed to cover all solid tumor cancers in which the tumors can be surgically removed. Another product line (DCVax-Direct) is designed for all solid tumor cancers which are considered inoperable and cannot be surgically removed. We believe the broad applicability of DCVax to many cancers provides multiple opportunities for commercialization and partnering.

&#160;

Our DCVax platform technology involves dendritic cells, the master cells of the immune system, and is designed to reinvigorate and educate the immune system to attack cancers. The dendritic cells are able to mobilize the overall immune system, including T cells, B cells and antibodies, natural killer cells and many others. Such mobilization of the overall immune system provides a broader attack on the cancer than mobilizing just a particular component, such as T cells alone, or a particular antibody alone. Likewise, our DCVax technology is designed to attack the full set of biomarkers, or antigens, on a patient&#8217;s cancer, rather than just a particular selected target or several targets. Clinical experience indicates that when just one or a few biomarkers on a cancer are targeted by a drug or other treatment, sooner or later the cancer usually develops a way around that drug, and the drug stops working. We believe that mobilizing all agents of the immune system, and targeting all biomarkers on the patient&#8217;s cancer, contributes to the effectiveness of DCVax.

&#160;

Our lead product, DCVax-L, is in an ongoing Phase III trial for newly diagnosed Glioblastome multiforme (GBM), with over 60 trial sites as of December 31, 2015. The trial is on partial clinical hold for screening of new patients for further enrollment; however, over 300 of the planned 348 patients had been enrolled in the trial as of December 31, 2015, and the patients already in the trial have continued to be treated in accordance with the trial protocol, without interruption.

&#160;

Our second product, DCVax-Direct, is being studies in a 60-patient Phase I/II trial for all types of inoperable solid tumors. The 40-patient Phase I stage of the trial has been completed. The Company is working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct.

Immune therapies for cancer 

&#160;

Development of effective immune therapies for cancer has long been a goal of the medical and scientific communities. The human immune system is very powerful, and also very complex: an &#8220;army&#8221; with many divisions and many different kinds of weapons. A diagram of some key agents and weapons of the immune system is set forth below:

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Diagram 1: The immune system includes many diverse agents. Dendritic cells are the master cells of the immune system. 

&#160;

It has taken decades of research to identify the many different types of immune system agents, to determine the relationships among them, and to determine how they work together to attack and defeat invaders such as bacteria, viruses and cancers. While the research was in process, early versions of immune therapies against cancers were tried, with mixed results and a number of failures. Over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, the first commercially successful category of immune agents to treat cancers emerged: drugs that consisted of individual antibodies, such as Avastin, Herceptin and Erbitux.

&#160;

Now, other types of immune therapies are also being developed, including checkpoint inhibitor drugs that are designed to &#8220;take the brakes off&#8221; immune responses, and T cell based therapies that are designed to deliver targeted immune agents to attack cancers. In addition, more broad based immune therapies are starting to come of age: &#8220;therapeutic vaccines&#8221; designed to mobilize the entire immune system, rather than just a single agent or single category of agents. Therapeutic vaccines are similar to preventive vaccines in that they work by mobilizing the immune system. However, therapeutic vaccines are administered to patients who already have a given disease, for the purpose of preventing or delaying recurrence or progression of the existing disease.

&#160;

Several of the therapeutic vaccines that are now coming of age are focusing on dendritic cells in various ways. These vaccines can potentially offer a broader potential immune response because dendritic cells are the master cells of the immune system. When dendritic cells are activated against a particular pathogen (or cancer) they, in turn, mobilize the overall immune system to attack that pathogen (or cancer). The process by which dendritic cells mobilize other agents takes place to a large extent in the lymph nodes.

&#160;

A major challenge faced by immune therapies for cancer has been that, unlike in a healthy patient with an infectious disease, in cancer patients the immune system is failing to stop the tumor.

&#160;

The mechanisms by which cancer cells selectively suppress or block the immune system are still the subject of much research. It is known that cancer cells have many such mechanisms, including secretion of biochemical signals that block normal immune signaling, that make tumor cells invisible to immune detection and/or that convey false messages to the immune system. Different therapeutic vaccines are taking different approaches to trying to overcome these cancer mechanisms and put the immune system back in action.

&#160;

Many of the therapeutic vaccines for cancer have targeted existing dendritic cells in situ in a patient&#8217;s body, by administering various compounds or factors that are designed to attract dendritic cells to the tumor or enhance the tumor signals to the dendritic cells (in essence, making the tumor signals &#8220;louder&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We and a few others are taking a different approach, based on the belief that existing dendritic cells in situ in a patient&#8217;s body are impaired and their ability to receive and process the necessary signals is blocked. Under this view, if the signaling is blocked, then no matter how &#8220;loud&#8221; the signal may be, it will not get through and will not achieve the activation needed.

&#160;

There are also other novel approaches being developed for cancers, including Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain cancer. For example, a medical device developed by Novocure and recently approved for commercialization involves delivery of electric current to the brain to enhance the effects of chemotherapy and thereby kill cancer cells.

&#160;

The DCVax Technology 

&#160;

As described above, our platform technology, DCVax, is a personalized immune therapy which consists of a therapeutic vaccine that uses a patient's own dendritic cells, or DCs, the master cells of the immune system, as the therapeutic agent. The patient&#8217;s DCs are obtained through a blood draw, or leukapheresis. The DCs are then activated and loaded with biomarkers (&#8220;antigens&#8221;) from the patient&#8217;s own tumor. The loading of biomarkers into the DCs &#8220;educates&#8221; the DCs about what the immune system needs to attack. The activated, educated DCs are then isolated with very high purity and constitute the DCVax personalized vaccine.

&#160;

We believe that injection of DCVax-L into the patient, through a simple intra-dermal injection, similar to a flu shot, in the upper arm, can initiate a potent immune response against cancer cells, mobilizing the overall immune system and doing so in the natural way, with the numerous immune agents acting in their normal roles and in combination with each other. We also believe that DCVax-Direct, which is directly injected into inoperable tumors, functions in a similar way. In short, DCVax is designed to restore the potent natural functioning of the immune system which has otherwise been impaired or blocked by the cancer.

&#160;

Importantly, each activated, educated dendritic cell has a large multiplier effect, mobilizing hundreds of T cells and other immune cells. As a result, small doses of such dendritic cells can mobilize large and sustained immune responses. Also very importantly, dendritic cells activate diverse populations of T cells (i.e., T cells targeted at a variety of different biomarker targets on the patient&#8217;s cancer). In contrast, T cell based therapies employ T cells aimed at just one biomarker target on the cancer, similar to targeted drugs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Diagram 2: One Educated Dendritic Cell Activates Hundreds of Anti-Cancer T Cells 

&#160; 

We believe that at least three key aspects of the DCVax technology contribute to the positive results (described more fully below) seen in clinical trials to date:

&#160;

&#160; (1) DCVax is personalized, and targets the particular biomarkers expressed on that patient&#8217;s tumor. Extensive scientific evidence has shown that there is substantial variation in tumor profiles and characteristics among patients with the &#8220;same&#8221; cancer. The degree of variation is particularly large in some of the most aggressive cancers, such as GBM brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Cancer drugs are typically keyed to a single target which is believed to be found on the cancer cells&#8217; surface or in one of the cancer cells&#8217; signaling pathways in a substantial percentage of patients with a given type of cancer. Such drugs are of no use in patients whose cancers do not happen to express that particular target, or cease expressing that target as the disease progresses. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (2) DCVax is designed to target not just one but the full set of biomarkers on the patient&#8217;s tumor. As mentioned above, cancer drugs are typically rifle shots aimed at just one target on a patient&#8217;s cancer. However, cancer is a complex and variable disease. Tumor profiles vary among patients with the &#8220;same&#8221; cancer and also vary as the disease progresses. Further, when rifle shot drugs hit individual targets on cancers, the cancers can find ways around them (called &#8220;escape variants&#8221;) - and the rifle shot treatments then usually stop working. DCVax takes the opposite approach: instead of aiming at a single target, DCVax is aimed at the full set of biomarkers on a patient&#8217;s cancer. Such treatment approach is expected to make it more difficult for tumors to develop escape variants. &#160;

&#160; (3) DCVax is designed to mobilize a systemic immune response , not just one among the many different categories of immune agents in that overall system. Some of the prominent cancer drugs today are composed of just one type of antibody - and antibodies themselves are just one type of agent in the overall immune system (see Diagram 1 above). In contrast, the full immune system involves many types of antibodies, and also many other kinds of agents besides antibodies. As described above, DCVax is comprised of activated, educated dendritic cells, and dendritic cells are the master cells of the immune system; they can mobilize a systemic immune response. &#160;

DCVax Product Lines 

&#160;

We have developed several different product lines based on the DCVax technology, to address multiple different cancers and different patient situations. There are two main components to each DCVax product: the immune cells (dendritic cells) and the cancer biomarker targets (antigens).

&#160;

All of our DCVax product lines are made from the patient&#8217;s own dendritic cells. The dendritic cells are freshly isolated, and newly matured and activated. We believe that the existing dendritic cells in a cancer patient have already been compromised by the cancer, and we believe that is the reason other vaccines aimed at the existing dendritic cells in patients have largely failed. However, the patient&#8217;s body continues to produce new precursors of dendritic cells, and these precursors (monocytes) circulate in the patient&#8217;s blood stream. For all DCVax products, these precursors are obtained through a blood draw, and then (through our proprietary manufacturing processes), the precursors are matured into a fresh, uncompromised batch of new dendritic cells.

&#160;

The antigen (biomarker target) component, which is combined with the fresh, personalized dendritic cells, varies among the DCVax product lines.

&#160;

Importantly, each of our product lines has an excellent safety profile. Patients may develop some flu-like symptoms, but there have been no toxicities such as are seen with chemotherapies and with some other types of immune therapies. Patients do not have to take a second set of drugs to manage side effects, there are no in-patient hospital stays to deal with side effects, and patients do not have to go home and stay in bed for several days to deal with side effects. Our DCVax patients typically go on with their work and their daily activities.

&#160;

DCVax-L &#160;- is designed for operable solid tumors. It is made with cancer antigens from tumor lysate (a protein extract from processed tumor cells) from the patient&#8217;s own tumor tissue. As such, DCVax-L incorporates the full set of tumor antigens, making it difficult for tumors to find ways around it (&#8220;escape variants&#8221;), as described above. DCVax-L is currently in our 348-patient Phase III clinical trial for GBM brain cancer, although the trial is on a partial clinical hold for new screening of patients for further enrollment. DCVax-L is anticipated to be applicable for any type of solid tumor cancers in situations in which the patient has their tumor surgically removed as part of standard of care.

&#160;

DCVax-Direct - is designed for inoperable solid tumors DCVax-Direct also incorporates the full set of tumor antigens (as does DCVax-L) but it does so in situ in the patient&#8217;s body rather than at the manufacturing facility. With DCVax-Direct, the new dendritic cells are partially matured in a special proprietary way so as to be ready to pick up antigens directly from tumor tissue in the patient&#8217;s body, and also communicate the information about those antigens to other agents of the immune system, such as T cells. The partially matured dendritic cells are then injected directly into the patient&#8217;s tumor(s). There, the dendritic cells pick up the antigens- in situ rather than picking up the antigens from tumor lysate in a lab dish at the manufacturing facility, as is done with DCVax-L. DCVax-Direct is anticipated to be applicable to any type of inoperable solid tumors.

Clinical Programs, Clinical Trial Results and Early Access Programs 

&#160;

Overall Clinical Pipeline 

&#160;

Over the last ten years, we have built a robust clinical pipeline with DCVax products for multiple cancers, which we believe provides us with multiple opportunities for success. Our lead product, DCVax-L for GBM brain cancer has previously gone through early stage trials, and is in now the late stages of a 348-patient international Phase III trial. We enrolled over 300 of the planned 348 patients, and the trial was then subject to a partial clinical hold on screening of new patients which remains in place at present. Our second product, DCVax-Direct for all types of inoperable solid tumors, has completed the 40-patient Phase I stage of a Phase I/II trial. We plan to progress into multiple Phase II trials with DCVax-Direct. In addition to these trials, our DCVax-L product has also been administered in a small early stage trial for metastatic ovarian cancer, and a DCVax product for prostate cancer successfully completed a 35-patient Phase I/II trial and was cleared by the FDA many years ago for a 612-patient Phase III trial.

&#160;

DCVax-L for Operable Solid Tumors: GBM Brain Cancer 

&#160;

Our lead product candidate is DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): the most aggressive and lethal type of brain cancer. With full standard of care treatment for GBM today, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the cancer recurs in a median of just 6.9 months and kills the patient in a median of just 14.6 months. There has been very little improvement in clinical outcomes for GBM patients in the last 30 years. The incidence of GBM appears to be on the rise, for unknown reasons, and there is an urgent need for new and better treatments.

&#160;

DCVax-L is currently in a 348-patient Phase III trial, although the trial is on a partial clinical hold in regard to new screening of patients. We have enrolled over 300 of the planned 348 patients, and the patients already in the trial are continuing to be treated in accordance with the protocol, without interruption. As of December 31, 2015, there were more than 60 clinical sites open and operating for the trial across the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Canada. 

&#160;

The trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial with two treatment arms. Patients in one arm receive standard of care plus DCVax-L; patients in the other arm receive standard of care plus a placebo. Patients are assigned randomly between the two arms: two-thirds of the patients into the DCVax-L arm and one-third into the placebo arm. Standard of care includes surgical removal of the brain tumor, followed by 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy and chemotherapy, followed by monthly chemotherapy. The standard of care chemotherapy is Temodar (temozolamide). The primary endpoint of the trial is median Progression Free Survival. Secondary endpoints include median Overall Survival. The trial includes a crossover arm, in which patients who originally receive the standard of care plus a placebo have an opportunity, when their disease progresses, to cross over and start receiving DCVax-L.

&#160;

&#8220;Information Arm&#8221; Outside the Phase III Trial 

&#160;

In parallel with the Phase III trial of DCVax-L for GBM, we accepted a total of 55 patients into an &#8220;Information Arm&#8221; outside of the trial, who failed to meet the eligibility requirements for the trial. Most of these patients (51 of the 55) were actual or potential &#8220;rapid progressors&#8221; (patients in whom the brain cancer is already appearing to re-grow by the time the patient finishes the 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy and daily chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumor). All of these 51 patients were treated with the same DCVax-L product as in the Phase III trial, on the same treatment schedule as in the trial, at the same medical centers as in the trial, in the same time period as the trial, and the data were collected and maintained by the same Contract Research Organization (CRO) as is managing the trial. Among the 51 patients, about 20 of them apparently met the &#8220;progression&#8221; (tumor re-growth) criteria and two time points, both at the end of the 6 weeks of daily radiation and chemotherapy and 8 weeks later, and about 25 of the patients met the &#8220;progression&#8221; criteria at one of the two time points.

&#160;

As we have reported, a significant extension of survival compared with expected survival times has been seen to date in a significant portion of these Information Arm patients. We plan to continue following these patients during this year, and plan to report on further results.

&#160;

DCVax-L Early Access Programs 

&#160;

In March 2014, we received approval from the German regulatory authority of a &#8220;Hospital Exemption&#8221; for DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers under Section 4b of the German Drug Law. This approval for DCVax-L was the first of its kind in a number of key ways, although the law had been in place for several years. Under this Hospital Exemption, we may provide DCVax-L to patients for the treatment of any glioma brain cancers (both Glioblastoma multiforme, the most severe grade, and lower grade, less-malignant gliomas), and both newly diagnosed and recurrent stages of disease, outside of our Phase III clinical trial, and charge full price for the product. The patients may be from Germany or elsewhere. This approval has a term of five years, and can be re-applied for and re-issued at the end of that period.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During 2014 and 2015, we undertook preparations for this Hospital Exemption early access program (for which the parties would not engage until we had received regulatory approval) including numerous contract negotiations with medical centers, separate arrangements for international patients at the medical centers, development of a registry and system for data collection, obtaining local licenses, development of patient contracts and consent and release forms, logistics arrangements, and other steps. During 2016, we plan to continue these program development activities.

&#160;

DCVax-Direct for Inoperable Solid Tumor Cancers 

&#160;

Our DCVax-Direct product offers a potential new treatment option for the wide range of clinical situations in which patients' tumors are considered inoperable because the patient has multiple tumors, or their tumor cannot be completely removed, or the surgery would cause undue damage to the patient and impair their quality of life.

&#160;

A large number of patients with a variety of cancer types (including lung, colon, pancreatic, liver, ovarian, head and neck, and others) are faced with this situation, because their tumors are already locally advanced or have begun to metastasize by the time symptoms develop and the patients seek diagnosis and treatment. For these patients, the outlook today is bleak and survival remains quite limited.

&#160;

DCVax-Direct is administered by direct injection into a patient's tumors. It can potentially be injected into any number of tumors, enabling patients with locally advanced disease or with metastases to be treated. DCVax-Direct can also be injected into tumors in virtually any location in the body: not only tissues at or near the surface of the body but also into interior tissues, with any form of image guidance (ultra-sound, MRI or CT).

&#160;

In the fall of 2012, we initiated the processes for manufacturing DCVax-Direct for clinical trials. During the first half of 2013, we (through Cognate BioServices) expanded and accelerated the manufacturing preparations, including assay development, test runs and other qualification and optimization work, on both the product and the automated system for key stages of the manufacturing. In the second half of 2013 we launched the 40-patient Phase I stage of our 60-patient Phase I/II clinical trial with DCVax-Direct, for all types of inoperable solid tumor cancers. The trial took place at two sites: MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and Orlando Health (formerly MD Anderson, Orlando). During 2015, we completed the Phase I stage of this trial, although we are still following patients from the trial.

&#160;

The patients who were enrolled in the Phase I trial had failed other treatments, had multiple tumors and actively progressing disease - these were effectively no-option patients. In spite of this heavy disease burden, though, the treatment regimen in this first clinical trial was very conservative: only one tumor was injected in each patient, and most of the patients received only 3 treatment over the course of 2 weeks, with some receiving a 4 th treatment at week 8 (with no treatments during the 6 weeks between the 3 rd and 4 th treatments).

&#160;

Despite these challenging circumstances, a number of case studies and interim data to date have been quite encouraging, as we have reported on several occasions. Clinical effects seen in various patients include examples of tumor necrosis (i.e., cell death) in the injected tumors, shrinkage or stabilization in some non-injected tumors, and/or stabilization of disease. We are continuing to collect follow-up data, and anticipate continuing to report on it.

&#160;

This Phase I trial was designed to be very informative: we are treated numerous diverse types of cancers (sarcoma, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, melanoma and others); we tested three different dose levels and various methods of image-guided administration; we are collected both imaging and biopsy data, and correlated them with clinical effects in patients; we evaluated both local effects in the injected tumors and systemic effects in the non-injected tumors; we evaluated potential endpoints for future trials; and most importantly, we are evaluated safety.

&#160;

Our experience with the Phase I stage of the DCVax-Direct Phase I/II trial is that the safety profile is excellent (as has also been the case over the years with DCVax-L). The typical effects are that patients develop a fever after the injections, but only a couple of degrees and only for a day or two, and they do not experience any significant toxicities.

&#160;

Based upon the data and experience over the course of 2014 and 2015, we are planning to proceed with at least two Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct in different cancers, in parallel. In these Phase II trials, we plan to inject multiple tumors, rather than just one tumor, and we plan to administer treatments weeks apart rather than months apart. We continue to receive strong interest for trials of DCVax-Direct in a variety of cancers.

&#160;

&#160; 

Target Markets for DCVax Products 

&#160;

Since our DCVax-L product is potentially applicable to all types of operable solid tumors, and our DCVax-Direct product is potentially applicable to all types of inoperable solid tumors, the potential markets for DCVax products are particularly large. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 2 men, and 1 in 3 women in the U.S. will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime. There are nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer per year in the U.S., and nearly 600,000 deaths from cancer. The statistics are similar in Europe and in much of the rest of the world.

&#160;

Brain cancer 

&#160;

Brain cancers fall into two broad categories: primary (meaning the cancer first originates in the brain) and metastatic (meaning the cancer first appears elsewhere in the body, but subsequently metastasizes to the brain). In the U.S. alone, on an annual basis, there are some 40,000 new cases of primary brain cancer, and 160,000 new cases of metastatic brain cancer. The numbers are similar in Europe and the rest of the world.

&#160;

Within the category of primary brain cancer, Grade 4 GBM is the most aggressive and lethal type. Among the approximately 40,000 new cases of primary brain cancer per year in the U.S., at least 12,000 cases are GBM (with some estimates as high as 17,000) and the incidence is increasing.

&#160;

In addition, brain cancer is a serious medical problem in children 18 years and under. It is the second most frequent type of childhood cancers (after leukemias) and, following progress in reducing death rates from leukemias, it is now a leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.

&#160;

Very little has changed in the last 30 years in the treatment and clinical outcomes for GBM. With all standard of care treatment today - surgery, radiation and chemotherapy - patients still die within a median of about 14.6 months from diagnosis.

&#160;

Although many experimental treatments are in various stages of clinical development, the one drug which has been the standard of care chemotherapy treatment for GBM to date, Temodar, achieved market saturation extremely rapidly, within two years of product launch. Temodar added 10 weeks of survival (extending survival from its historical 12 months to the 14.6 months typical today), and did so in a limited percentage of patients. Other drugs approved by FDA for GBM, such as Avastin, did not extend survival at all.

&#160;

One new treatment developed by another company (Novocure) was approved for GBM in 2015: an electrical device called Optune. The device involves placing electrodes all over a patient&#8217;s scalp, and generating an electric current that helps enhance the effects of chemotherapy. Patients must keep their heads shaved so that the electrodes make the necessary contact, and must carry a 7-pound battery for the device. The device was approved by the FDA for Newly Diagnosed GBM based on an open label trial showing 2.8 months of survival advantage.

&#160;

Against this backdrop, we believe DCVax is well positioned for this target market. Further, after seeking regulatory approval for DCVax for the GBM subset of primary brain cancers, in the future we plan to conduct clinical trials and seek approval for other primary brain cancers and for metastatic brain cancers, as well as, ultimately, other types of solid tumor cancers.

&#160;

Manufacturing of DCVax 

&#160;

We believe that our proprietary manufacturing process for DCVax products is a key to the practicality of our product and to favorable product economics. We have spent more than a decade honing this manufacturing process.

&#160;

We have pioneered a DCVax-L manufacturing model under which at least 3 years of treatments are normally produced in a single personalized batch for each patient. Similarly, for DCVax-Direct, we may produce a full course of treatment in a single personalized batch for a patient.

&#160;

In addition, we have implemented special cryopreservation methods which enable this multi-year or multi-dose quantity of personalized product to be frozen, and kept frozen for years, while maintaining its viability and potency.

&#160;

Both of these technologies, the personalized batch manufacturing for each patient and the cryopreservation, are essential elements of our manufacturing model and product economics. Together, they enable us to usually incur the high costs of manufacturing just one time for each patient, and then store the multi-year quantity of product, frozen, in single doses. This makes DCVax effectively an &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; product for the patient after the initial manufacturing, even though it is personalized, and we anticipate that this will enable the pricing of DCVax to be in line with other new cancer drugs. We also believe that both automation and economies of scale will further enhance the product economics. The manufacturing process today is also rapid: about 8 days for DCVax-L, and 7 days for DCVax-Direct, followed by quality control and release testing.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We contract out the manufacturing of our DCVax products to Cognate BioServices. Although there are many contract manufacturers for small molecule drugs and for biologics, there are only a few contract manufacturers in the U.S. and even fewer in Europe that specialize in producing living cell products and that have a track record of success with regulatory authorities. The manufacturing of living cell products is highly specialized and entirely different than production of biologics: the physical facilities and equipment are different, the types of personnel and skill sets are different, and the processes are different. The regulatory requirements relating to manufacturing of cellular products (especially personalized cellular products) are exceptionally difficult to meet and are one of the most frequent reasons for a company&#8217;s clinical trials and product development to be put on clinical hold (i.e., stopped by regulatory authorities).

&#160;

Cognate BioServices is one of the few companies that specializes in the production of cellular products, and has been doing so for 14 years (far longer than others). Very importantly, Cognate also has a leading track record of regulatory success specifically with cellular products.

&#160;

In addition to the rigorous regulatory requirements, our DCVax programs involve a particularly challenging operational and business requirement: our programs require a large amount of capacity in these specialized manufacturing facilities, and require that the large capacity be dedicated exclusively to our programs. Most medical products, including cellular products, are made in batches on a &#8220;campaign&#8221; basis: the same manufacturing suites are used for a number of companies&#8217; products, at designated times scheduled in advance. In contrast, our products are fully personalized and can only be made in individual personalized batches, not large-scale batches of standardized products, and our products are made on demand, on an ongoing basis. So, the manufacturing suites must be dedicated entirely to NW Bio&#8217;s products. Among the few specialized contract manufacturers for cellular products, even fewer have the necessary capacity that can be dedicated exclusively to NW Bio.

&#160;

Cognate BioServices&#8217; manufacturing facility for clinical-grade cell products is located in Memphis, Tennessee, a major air shipping hub for both Federal Express and UPS. Cognate BioServices' facility is approximately 80,000 square feet and contains substantial buildout expansion space in addition to the portions currently built out and in use. The current manufacturing facilities are sufficient to produce DCVax for at least several thousand patients per year - an amount well in excess of what is needed for the Phase III clinical trial under way. The expansion space will also allow us to procure significantly increasing capacity as we scale-up towards many more patients for commercialization. The facility planned for the U.K. will similarly allow for scale-up there.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160;

We have an integrated strategy for protection of our technology through both patents and other mechanisms, such as Orphan Drug status. As of December 31, 2015, we have over 140 issued patents and 55 pending patent applications worldwide, grouped into 12 patent families. Of these, 107 issued patents and 41 pending patent applications relate to our DCVax products. In the United States and Europe, some of our patents and applications relate to the composition and use of products, while other patents and applications related to other aspects such as manufacturing and quality control. For example, in the United States, we have three issued and seven pending patent applications that relate to the composition and/or use of our DCVax products. We also have other U.S patents and applications that cover, among other things, quality control for DCVax, as well as an automated system which we believe will play a major role in the scale-up of production for large numbers of patients on a cost-effective basis. Similarly, in Europe, we have four patents issued by and six pending patent applications with the European Patent Office (&#34;EPO&#34;) that cover our DCVax products, and other patents and applications that cover aspects such as manufacturing and quality control, and the automated system. In Japan, we have five issued patents and three pending patent applications relating to our DCVax products, as well as manufacturing related patents. Patents have been granted and are pending in other foreign jurisdictions we consider important potential future markets for our DCVax products.

&#160;

During 2012, 13 new patents, including one European and twelve other foreign patents, were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents covered a variety of subject matter, such as the proprietary partial maturation for DCVax-Direct, the machines and systems to manufacture DCVax-Direct, certain processes for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells in general, certain measures of product quality, and other matters.

&#160;

During 2013, eight new patents, including three U.S. and five other foreign patents, were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover a variety of subject matter, such as the proprietary partial maturation for DC-Vax-Direct, the machine and systems to manufacture DCVax-Direct, and certain processes for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells in general, and other matters.

&#160;

In September 2013, we announced that we had been issued U.S. patent #8,518,636, covering a next-generation process for manufacturing lower cost human dendritic cells of both a higher quality and higher reliability. This next generation system has already been cleared by the FDA for use in the manufacturing of dendritic cells for our clinical trials. These systems are now in use producing the vaccines which have already been injected into the tumors of DCVax-Direct patients.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

During 2014, seven new patents (including one European patent validated into 26 patents in various European countries and seven other foreign patents) were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover a variety of subject matter, such as the machine and system to manufacture DCVax-Direct and certain processes for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells.

&#160;

During 2015, nine new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents include U.S. patent #9,102,917, a second U.S. patent enlarging our coverage of a method for producing human dendritic cells for our DCVax-Direct product. The other newly issued patents cover a variety of subject matter, such as the machine and system to manufacture DCVax-Direct and processes for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells.

&#160;

The expiration dates of the issued U.S. patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2028. The expiration dates of the issued European patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2028. For some of the earlier dates, we plan to seek extensions of the patent life, and believe we have reasonable grounds for doing so.

&#160;

In addition to our patent portfolio, we have obtained Orphan Drug designation for our lead product, DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers. Such designation brings with it a variety of benefits, including potential market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe if our product is the first of its type to reach the market.

&#160;

This market exclusivity applies regardless of patents, (i.e., even if the company that developed it has no patent coverage on the product). In addition, the time period for such market exclusivity does not begin to run until product sales begin. In contrast, the time period of a patent begins when the patent is filed and runs down during the years while the product is going through development and clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A large and growing number of companies are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer (including Juno, Kite, Bellicum, Atara, Argos, Agenus, Asterias and many others). In addition, many big pharma companies (including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) are rapidly developing, and have begun obtaining accelerated approvals for, a new class of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to &#8220;take the brakes off&#8221; patients&#8217; immune responses to cancer. Other novel technologies for cancer are also under development or have recently been approved, such as the Optune electro-therapy device of NovoCure. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based and bi-specific antibody based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based drugs are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies.

&#160;

We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above, as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin&#174; (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel&#174; (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar&#174; (Merck &#38; Co., Inc.), as well as the Optune electro-therapy device recently approved. Both checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell based therapies are rapidly pursuing clinical trials for brain cancer, as well.

&#160;

Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and collaborators, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs, and in obtaining sites for our clinical trials and enrolling patients.

Employees and Contractors 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 12 employees, as well as manufacturing related employees in Germany. We believe our employee relations are positive.

&#160;

In addition to our full-time employees, a substantial number of contractors provide various services for our corporate operations. We have contract management of our clinical trials and contract manufacturing of our products.

&#160;

Since 2012 a third party firm has been performing the functions of a Chief Financial Officer, including financial systems and financial reporting. During 2015, this third party firm substantially expanded the personnel handling our Company&#8217;s CFO functions: the team now includes 5 partners and several senior associates staff. This third party firm specializes in providing such services to bio-pharma companies, both small and large, and the owners are highly experienced former partners of &#8220;Big Four&#8221; accounting firms.

&#160;

This contract services approach has enabled us to have important financial functions performed by experienced specialists, and also to have large support teams for our work on an as-needed basis, without the ongoing expense. However, we plan to develop more internal systems and structures, and expand our internal personnel for these functions, over the coming year as our programs continue to grow and we move toward completion of certain clinical trials.
