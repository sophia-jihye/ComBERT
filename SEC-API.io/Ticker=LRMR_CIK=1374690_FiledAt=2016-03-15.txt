 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by obesity and complex metabolic disorders. Beloranib, our lead product candidate, is a novel, first-in-class, twice-weekly subcutaneous injection being developed for the treatment of multiple indications, including severe obesity in two rare diseases, Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and hypothalamic injury-associated obesity, or HIAO, including craniopharyngioma-associated obesity. We are also developing ZGN-839, a liver-targeted methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, inhibitor, for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and abdominal obesity, as well as other second-generation methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, inhibitors for the treatment of severe obesity. In December 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, placed a full clinical hold on our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for beloranib, as a result of the number of thrombotic events observed in patients treated with beloranib in our clinical trials. We plan to present to the FDA data from our recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating beloranib as a treatment for PWS and our recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating beloranib in severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes, a proposal for a risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS, and other requested data, in an effort to resolve the full clinical hold. 

Obesity is a complex medical disorder involving appetite dysregulation and altered lipid and energy metabolism that results in excessive accumulation of fat tissue. Weight loss and hunger control are urgently needed for certain subpopulations of obese patients, in which obesity is life-threatening and a co-morbidity of an underlying condition such as PWS and HIAO that, while rare, occurs most commonly as a consequence of treatment for craniopharyngioma and other mid-brain tumors. PWS and HIAO are characterized by severe and intractable obesity resulting from damage to or impaired functioning of the hypothalamus, an area of the brain responsible for many functions including the neurophysiological drive to eat. 

PWS is a rare and complex genetic disorder characterized by physiologic, cognitive and behavioral symptoms, including hyperphagia, uncontrollable hunger and its related behaviors, and obesity. Beloranib is currently in Phase 3 development as a treatment for PWS. In January 2016, we announced the results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib evaluating the safety and efficacy of beloranib in patients with PWS, during a six-month randomized treatment period. The clinical trial achieved its co-primary efficacy endpoints, as patients treated with beloranib achieved a statistically significant reduction in both body weight and hyperphagia-related behaviors. If the FDA lifts the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND, we anticipate the need to conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib in patients with PWS in the United States and likely in the European Union, after discussing the trial design with the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities. Beloranib received orphan designation for the treatment of PWS from the FDA, and the European Commission in January 2013 and July 2014, respectively. We believe that rare conditions such as PWS afford us an opportunity to rapidly develop and commercialize beloranib using smaller, more focused and less costly clinical trials, relative to those required to develop a MetAP2 inhibitor for the broader severe obesity population. 

Published population studies estimate that the prevalence of PWS in the United States and in the European Union ranges from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 50,000. The physiological drive to eat in patients with PWS is so powerful that they will go to great lengths to eat large quantities of food, even if it is spoiled, indigestible or unpalatable to others. Unsupervised patients will often eat to the point that it causes serious physical harm or death. As a result, 

&#160;

caregivers are often forced to place locks and alarms on refrigerators and pantries that contain food. Despite attempts to control the access to food, the typical adult patient with PWS is morbidly obese and, based on our evaluation of published survival data, has an average life expectancy of 32 years of age. Unfortunately, neither dietary intervention nor currently available pharmaceutical therapies bring meaningful benefit to patients with PWS and, as a result, they experience severe and life-threatening consequences of their condition. Furthermore, existing surgical techniques such as bariatric surgery are contraindicated in PWS, as patients with PWS often overeat to a point whereby they can rupture their stomachs, which is frequently a cause of death. Since beloranib works through a novel mechanism that does not appear to require a fully functioning hypothalamic control pathway, we believe that obese patients with conditions in which increased hunger is central to the disease may respond well to treatment with beloranib. 

HIAO is most commonly caused by damage incurred during removal of a central nervous system tumor called craniopharyngioma, but it can also result from less common types of hypothalamic injury such as strokes, brain trauma, or radiation therapy to the brain. In January 2015, we announced the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial of beloranib administered twice weekly in 14 patients with HIAO caused by the treatment of craniopharyngioma or pituitary macroadenoma. We observed mean weight loss of 3.4 kg and 6.2 kg in patients with HIAO after four and eight weeks of treatment with beloranib, respectively, in contrast to 0.3 kg mean weight loss in patients treated with placebo for four weeks. Improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors of lipids and inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein) were also observed. We will decide whether to pursue additional clinical trials of beloranib in patients with HIAO, if the FDA lifts the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND. In September 2015, beloranib received orphan drug designation from the European Union for the treatment of craniopharyngioma-associated obesity, and we plan to seek orphan drug designation for beloranib for the treatment of HIAO in the United States. 

Although beloranib is likely to be focused on rare diseases, such as PWS and HIAO, we may pursue clinical development for severely obese patients in the general population, including patients otherwise eligible for bariatric surgery, with our second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors. Bariatric surgery eligibility criteria generally identify surgical candidates as those patients with body mass indices, or BMIs, greater than 40 kg/m2, or those with BMIs over 35 kg/m2 who also have a significant and uncontrolled co-morbid condition. Based on these criteria, it is estimated conservatively that there will be at least 16 million adults in the United States eligible for bariatric surgery by the time beloranib or another MetAP2 inhibitor could become available commercially. Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss, but the financial expense and the potential for complications, adverse events and longer-term side effects limit its overall adoption, with only a few hundred thousand patients in the United States undergoing bariatric surgery each year. Existing pharmacotherapies result in less weight loss than surgical options, and these therapies not only have undesirable side effects, but also have risk of abuse. Due to the significant barriers associated with bariatric surgery and the limited weight loss potential of currently marketed pharmaceutical products, there is a significant unmet need for the treatment of patients with severe obesity. We believe this patient population would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through the reduction of body weight and through improvement of other co-morbid conditions. 

In February 2016, we reported results from our Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating beloranib in the treatment of severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes. The clinical trial achieved its primary efficacy endpoint, as treatment with beloranib resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight compared to placebo. Patients treated with beloranib also met a key secondary endpoint, achieving a reduction in HbA1c of 2.0 percent compared to a reduction of 0.6 percent for placebo. Although beloranib is likely to be focused on rare diseases, such as PWS and HIAO, we may pursue clinical development for severely obese patients in the general population, including patients otherwise eligible for bariatric surgery, with our second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors. 

MetAP2 inhibitors may also have utility in the treatment of other metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, and NASH. In a mouse model of diabetes, NAFLD, and NASH, our second product candidate, ZGN-839, a MetAP2 inhibitor, reduced the severity of NAFLD and NASH. ZGN-839 may 

&#160;

provide patient convenience in the form of oral dosing, or an otherwise improved clinical profile. In January 2016, we withdrew the ZGN-839 IND that we previously submitted to the FDA, in order to focus on generating additional data regarding the potential risk of thrombosis. We will decide next steps with regard to this IND application, following resolution of the full clinical hold on our beloranib IND. 

Beloranib is a novel, first-in-class injectable small molecule therapy with a unique mechanism of action that reduces hunger while stimulating the use of stored fat as an energy source. Beloranib is the first anti-obesity agent with the potential to address two important abnormalities that are present in the obese patient&#151;hunger that is inappropriate relative to the amount of energy stored as fat and dysregulation of fat metabolism, which causes more fat to be made and stored in an obese patient than in a lean person. Beloranib acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body packages and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger.

Populations of Interest 

Obesity Caused by Rare Conditions 

Obesity is a complex medical disorder involving appetite dysregulation and altered lipid and energy metabolism that results in excessive accumulation of fat tissue. We plan to develop beloranib for the treatment of subpopulations of obese patients, including those with rare conditions such as PWS and HIAO, where obesity is a co-morbidity of an underlying condition. These conditions frequently are characterized by increased and life-threatening hunger that occurs secondary to damage to the hypothalamus, genetic conditions affecting embryological development or function of the hypothalamus, or conditions that occur as a result of certain drug side effects, radiation therapy, or other impairments to the normal function of the hypothalamus. Regardless of the causative agent or condition, the resultant damage to the hypothalamus impairs its normal function, including the ability to modulate hunger. These conditions are most often associated with a severe and life-limiting form of obesity and neither dietary interventions nor currently available pharmaceutical therapies bring meaningful benefit to these patients, for whom bariatric surgery is generally contra-indicated. Based on results from animal experiments in which compromised hypothalamic function caused hunger and obesity, we believe that beloranib may have utility in the treatment of severe obesity and hyperphagia, or insatiable life-threatening hunger and hunger-related behavior, in human disease settings in which hypothalamic food intake control centers are compromised. We are developing beloranib in these subpopulations of patients as a treatment for obesity and hyperphagia in patients with PWS and HIAO, and potentially other rare diseases. 

PWS 

PWS is the most common known genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. PWS is a rare and complex non-inherited genetic disorder, which results from abnormalities of the fifteenth chromosome. Symptoms associated with PWS are believed to result, in part, from a defect in the hypothalamus, an important supervisory center in the brain that controls many important bodily functions, such as hunger, metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and expression of emotions. 

Beginning in childhood, the brain of a patient with PWS fails to regulate metabolism and appetite normally. As a result, the vast majority of patients with PWS suffer from hyperphagia and obesity. Patients with PWS are constantly preoccupied with food and an unrelenting and overriding physiological drive to eat. Hyperphagia, a leading symptom of PWS, has a significant negative impact on the patients&#146; quality of life as well as drives obesity and a range of associated co-morbidities. Normal satiety, or the feeling of fullness after eating, does not exist in a person with PWS. The physiological drive to eat is so powerful and overwhelming that most patients with PWS will go to great lengths to eat large quantities of food, even if it is spoiled, indigestible, or unpalatable to others. Furthermore, patients with PWS have a reduced propensity for nausea and vomiting. In addition to obesity, a variety of other symptoms can be associated with PWS, including cognitive challenges, intellectual disabilities, growth hormone deficiency/short stature, low sensitivity to pain, hypersomnolence, or excessive sleepiness, and infertility due to hypogonadism, or insufficient production of sex hormones. 

Hyperphagia impairs a patient with PWS&#146;s ability to live independently, requiring costly and constant supervision to prevent overeating. Without supervision, patients with PWS are likely to die prematurely as a result of choking, stomach rupture or tissue necrosis, or from complications caused by morbid obesity, such as right heart failure and respiratory failure; in addition, preliminary data suggests that patients with PWS may be at a higher risk of death from pulmonary embolism than the general population. Based on our evaluation of published survival data, the average life expectancy of patients with PWS is approximately 32 years of age. While a small number of patients with PWS are cared for in costly group homes, the majority of patients with PWS are cared for in their homes and their families undertake substantial effort to create physical barriers to eating. These efforts result in extremely stressful environments as caregivers often place locks and alarms on cabinets and refrigerators that contain food to impede a patient with PWS&#146;s efforts to obtain food at all times. We estimate the typical annual cost of treating a patient with PWS is $100,000 to $200,000, excluding the often 

&#160;

significant costs of drug therapies related to other medical and psychological conditions, and the costs of any lost time from work experienced by their families due to responsibilities related to the care of a patient with PWS. 

Published population studies estimate that the prevalence of PWS in the United States and in the European Union ranges from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 50,000. PWS is diagnosed at an early age, typically in the first year of life, and we believe that, due to the severity of the condition and its unique attributes, the vast majority of patients affected by PWS are diagnosed. We believe that approximately 40-50% of patients with PWS are 12 years of age or older. We believe that further information regarding the prevalence of PWS will become available through a patient registry that is currently being developed by the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. 

Although there are pharmacological treatments for various symptoms of PWS, such as replacement of human growth hormone in patients with PWS that are deficient in growth hormone, based on our discussions with physicians who treat patients with PWS, there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for obesity and hyperphagia in PWS. Furthermore, bariatric surgery is contraindicated in patients with PWS due to poor outcomes related to an increased risk of rupture of the reduced stomach in the setting of sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass procedures, or rupture of the restricted esophagus in the setting of gastric banding procedures with the consequence of life-threatening gastric perforation. Apart from restricted access to food and constant supervision to prevent both life-threatening overeating and morbid obesity, there is currently no treatment for obesity and hyperphagia in patients with PWS. In January 2016, we announced the results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib evaluating the safety and efficacy of beloranib in patients with PWS, during a six-month randomized treatment period. The clinical trial achieved its co-primary efficacy endpoints, as patients treated with beloranib demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both body weight and hyperphagia-related behaviors. If we are able to reach an agreement with the FDA that an appropriate, safe, and effective pathway can be developed to support lifting the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND, we anticipate the need to conduct another Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib in patients with PWS in the United States and likely the European Union, after discussing the trial design with applicable regulatory authorities. 

In January 2013 and July 2014, the FDA and European Commission, respectively, granted orphan designation for our application to treat PWS with beloranib. Orphan drug designation provides for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States and ten years of marketing exclusivity in the European Union. 

HIAO 

HIAO is most commonly caused by damage incurred during removal of a central nervous system tumor called craniopharyngioma, but it can also result from less common types of hypothalamic injury such as strokes, brain trauma, or radiation therapy to the brain. Approximately 30% to 50% of cases of craniopharyngioma are diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. Manifestations of craniopharyngioma include visual disturbances, headaches and impairment to the hypothalamus-pituitary axis affecting hormone secretion. Treatment of these tumors commonly involves radical surgical removal of the tumor mass by endoscopy or craniotomy, followed by radiation treatment, which results in disruption or removal of neighboring structures including the hypothalamus. Depending on the degree of damage to the hypothalamus caused by tumor removal and subsequent radiation, there may be greater variation in hyperphagia and obesity prevalence in patients with craniopharyngioma than patients with PWS. Post-treatment hypothalamic dysfunction results in hyperphagia in approximately 50% of these patients, resulting in obesity and a worsened quality of life. 

Craniopharyngioma is a rare form of benign brain tumor that occurs most commonly during childhood and infiltrates near the optic nerve, pituitary gland and the hypothalamus. Published population studies estimate that the incidence of craniopharyngioma is 0.13 to 0.17 per 100,000 per year, or approximately 400 to 500 cases per year in the United States and 650 to 850 cases per year in the European Union. We believe patients with craniopharyngioma-associated obesity have a longer life expectancy than patients with PWS, which contributes to an increased risk of developing obesity-related co-morbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes in such patients. 

Currently available therapeutic agents fail to provide satisfactory management of weight or hyperphagia in patients with HIAO, and bariatric surgery is not frequently employed in this patient population. We believe this 

&#160;

is related to perceived risks of surgical interventions in this population including increased risk of post-surgical complications and minimal impact on the underlying problems of low metabolic rate and hyperphagia. 

In January 2015, we reported the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial of beloranib administered twice weekly in 14 patients with HIAO caused by the treatment of craniopharyngioma or pituitary macroadenoma. We observed mean weight loss of 3.4 kg and 6.2 kg in patients with HIAO after four and eight weeks of treatment with beloranib, respectively, in contrast to 0.3 kg mean weight loss in patients treated with placebo for four weeks. Improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors of lipids and inflammation (as measured by C-reactive protein) were also observed. We will decide whether to pursue additional clinical trials of beloranib in patients with HIAO, if the FDA lifts the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND. In September 2015, beloranib received orphan drug designation from the European Union for the treatment of craniopharyngioma-associated obesity, and plan to seek orphan drug designation for beloranib for the treatment of HIAO in the United States. 

Severe Obesity in the General Population 

Our long-term intention is to pursue clinical development of a second-generation MetAP2 inhibitor as a treatment for severely obese patients in the general population. We believe this patient population would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through the reduction of body weight and through improvement of severity or symptoms of other co-morbid conditions. We believe that MetAP2 inhibitors have the potential to offer this patient population, most of which is not adequately responsive to available therapies, substantial health and quality of life benefits. 

The most effective current treatment for severe obesity is bariatric surgery, including procedures such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion. Bariatric surgery produces dramatic and sustained weight loss, ranging on average from 20% to 35% one year post-procedure and reduces overall mortality, but it can result in numerous complications and adverse events including thrombotic events, such as pulmonary embolism, infection, internal bleeding, pulmonary disease and gastrointestinal obstruction, which sometimes require reoperation during the post-operative period. Longer-term side effects of bariatric surgery, such as poor nutrient absorption, strictures and hernias, have also been observed. 

Bariatric surgery eligibility criteria generally identify surgical candidates as those patients with BMIs, greater than 40 kg/m2, or those with BMIs over 35 kg/m2 who also have a significant and uncontrolled co-morbid condition. Based on these criteria, it is estimated conservatively that there will be at least 16 million adults in the United States eligible for bariatric surgery by the time beloranib or another MetAP2 inhibitor could become available commercially. In addition to the BMI and co-morbidity eligibility criteria, patients need to satisfy a number of other criteria in order to have bariatric surgery; a severely obese patient must not have any known endocrine causes of obesity, a drug or alcohol problem, or an uncontrolled psychological condition, and must understand and appreciate the risks of the surgical intervention. According to the American Society for Metabolic &#38; Bariatric Surgery and to HealthGrades, the average cost of bariatric surgery in the United States is approximately $22,000-$38,000. As a result of these limiting criteria and the financial commitments required, only a few hundred thousand patients undergo bariatric surgery each year even though over 16 million patients in the United States are eligible for the surgery based on BMI alone. 

The pharmaceutical industry has undertaken several waves of activity to discover and develop new drugs for the treatment of obesity. Relative to bariatric surgery, pharmaceutical treatments have produced modest efficacy. In addition, existing pharmacotherapeutics for obesity often have undesirable adverse event profiles. 

&#160;

The following table summarizes information from pivotal trials supporting registration for the current pharmacological treatments for severe obesity and the key limitations of these treatments, and unless specified otherwise in the table below, weight loss data is based on one year or longer treatment with the drug:

* Placebo-adjusted weight loss refers to the difference in mean weight loss observed in drug-treated patients and the weight change within the same trial observed in placebo-treated patients. This analysis takes into account, at least in part, the impact of diet and lifestyle interventions employed in drug registration trials. ** Some patients in our clinical trials of beloranib have reported gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea or vomiting as well as sleep disturbance. In addition, beloranib will likely carry a Category X label and therefore be contraindicated in pregnant women or women looking to become pregnant. In February 2016, we reported results from our Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating beloranib in the treatment of severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes. The clinical trial achieved its primary efficacy endpoint, as treatment with beloranib resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight compared to placebo. Patients treated with beloranib also met a key secondary endpoint, achieving a reduction in HbA1c of 2.0 percent compared to a reduction of 0.6 percent for placebo. Although beloranib is likely to be focused on rare diseases, such as PWS and HIAO, we may pursue clinical development for severely obese patients in the general population, including patients otherwise eligible for bariatric surgery, with our second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors. 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to be a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to significantly improve the health and well-being of patients affected by obesity and complex metabolic disorders. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance the clinical development of beloranib in subpopulations of obese patients, including those with rare conditions, where obesity is a co-morbidity of an underlying condition. Diseases in this category include PWS, HIAO and monogenic loss of function mutations, including leptin deficiency and melanocortin receptor subclass 4 mutations. We believe that rare conditions such as PWS and HIAO afford us an opportunity to rapidly develop and commercialize beloranib using smaller, more focused and less costly clinical trials, relative to those required to develop a MetAP2 inhibitor for the broader severe obesity population. Beloranib exerts its weight loss effects using a novel mechanism that does not appear to require fully functioning hypothalamic control pathways. We believe this mechanism is well-suited for patients with obesity that is caused by the failure of hypothalamic food intake control mechanisms, in particular the control of insatiable life-threatening hunger and hunger-related behavior, or hyperphagia. In January 2016, we announced the results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib evaluating the safety and efficacy of beloranib in patients with PWS, during a six-month randomized treatment period. The clinical trial achieved its co-primary efficacy endpoints, as patients treated with beloranib demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both body weight and hyperphagia-related behaviors. If we are able to reach an agreement with the FDA that an appropriate, safe, and effective pathway can be developed to support lifting the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND, we anticipate the need to conduct another Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib in patients with PWS in the United States and likely the European Union, after discussing the trial design with applicable regulatory authorities. In January 2015, we announced the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial of beloranib administered twice weekly in 14 patients with HIAO caused by the treatment of craniopharyngioma or pituitary macroadenoma. We observed mean weight loss of 3.4 kg and 6.2 kg in patients with HIAO after four and eight weeks of treatment with beloranib, respectively, in contrast to 0.3 kg mean weight loss in patients treated with placebo for four weeks. We will decide whether to pursue additional clinical trials of beloranib in patients with HIAO, if the FDA lifts the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND. We plan to present data to the FDA from our recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating beloranib as a treatment for PWS and our recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial of evaluating beloranib in severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes, a proposal for a risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS, and other requested data, in an effort to resolve the full clinical hold. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance the clinical development of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of severely obese patients in the general population, including those who are candidates for bariatric surgery. We believe the severely obese patient population would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through the reduction of body weight and through improvement of other co-morbid conditions. Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss, but the financial expense and the potential for complications, adverse events and longer-term side effects limit its overall adoption, with only a few hundred thousand patients in the United States undergoing bariatric surgery each year. Existing pharmacotherapies result in less weight loss than surgical options, and these therapies not only have undesirable side effects, but also have risk of abuse. In February 2016, we reported results from our Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating beloranib in the treatment of severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes. The clinical trial achieved its primary efficacy endpoint, as treatment with the 1.8 mg and the 1.2 mg doses of beloranib resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight of 12.7% (p&#60;0.0001) and 13.5% (p&#60;0.0001), respectively, compared with a reduction of 3.1% for placebo. Patients treated with beloranib also met a key secondary endpoint, achieving a reduction in HbA1c of 2.0% (p&#60;0.0001) compared to a reduction of 0.6% (p&#60;0.0001) for placebo. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage the knowledge of our experienced team of drug developers that have deep expertise in the field of obesity, the function of MetAP2 inhibitors and metabolic diseases. Our management team has deep expertise in obesity and related metabolic diseases, the function of MetAP2 inhibitors, the strengths and weaknesses of current treatments for obesity and the ability to recognize the potential of novel therapies for the treatment of obesity. Our team is complemented by highly experienced external consultants and collaborators in the areas of drug discovery, development and regulatory approval. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain flexibility in commercializing and maximizing the value of our development programs. While we intend to develop and commercialize beloranib for indications such as PWS and other rare conditions causing obesity, we may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of beloranib or our other earlier-stage development programs. For beloranib, we may enter into one or more strategic relationships to access broader geographic markets or additional indications. These relationships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales of beloranib. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Development of other potential product candidates. We have a second program focused on the delivery of MetAP2 inhibitors with targeted tissue distribution that shows early promise in animal models of NAFLD, NASH and abdominal obesity. Our lead MetAP2 inhibitor in this class of molecules is called ZGN-839. We have been advancing multiple candidate drugs into early development to establish clinical proof of concept, safety and tolerability of these molecules as a way to leverage our internal know-how in metabolic diseases and the effects of MetAP2 inhibitors. These compounds, typified by ZGN-839 or our other second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors, could provide additional short-term value to our company through focused development partnerships and collaborations. Mechanism of Action 

Beloranib is a novel, first-in-class injectable small molecule therapy with a unique mechanism of action that reduces hunger while stimulating the use of stored fat as an energy source. Beloranib is the first new anti-obesity agent with the potential to address two important abnormalities that are present in the obese patient&#151;hunger that is inappropriate relative to the amount of energy stored as fat and dysregulation of fat metabolism, which causes more fat to be made and stored in an obese patient than in a lean person. 

Beloranib is a potent inhibitor of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress mediators, and, thus, reducing fat synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition increases metabolism of fats as an energy source. MetAP2 inhibitors also reduce hunger and food intake by novel mechanisms that require further study to be fully understood. 

Beloranib was evaluated for its potential for treating obesity following publication of studies in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 showing anti-obesity efficacy in animals treated with a prototype MetAP2 inhibitor. These studies showed that MetAP2 inhibitor treatment was associated with loss of fat tissue accompanied by an increase in fat oxidation, indicating a redirection of fuel usage toward utilization of stored fats as a source of energy. Reduced food intake also was observed in treated animals, suggesting either direct effects of the agent on central feeding regulation or activation of a feedback loop linking the release and oxidation of stored fat to appetite. 

The MetAP2 inhibitor fumagillin, a structural analog of beloranib, was shown in 2004 to induce a novel protein-protein interaction involving MetAP2 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1, or ERK1, a cell stress- and growth factor-stimulated kinase. This complex reduces the activation state of ERK1. A 2005 publication in Diabetes showed that animals lacking ERK1 resist both high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, supporting the hypothesis that attenuation of ERK activity could be an important component of the beneficial metabolic effects of MetAP2 inhibitor treatment. Several hormones well-documented to be involved in energy 

&#160;

metabolism are affected by beloranib, including leptin, adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor-21. These hormones are thought to contribute to the weight-reducing effects of beloranib and also are known to be involved in control of body weight, fat metabolism and glucose metabolism. This series of mechanistic effects leads to rapid and sustained reduction of excess body weight with beloranib treatment, such as has been observed in animal studies and our clinical trial experience to date. 

Our clinical experience to date shows that beloranib treatment is also associated with improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors such as plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL, and C-reactive protein, or CRP. Plasma total cholesterol, HDL, CRP, and systolic blood pressure are considered to be the most rigorous systemic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Our clinical experience to date with beloranib suggests that its use is not associated with an increase in blood pressure or heart rate, which makes it particularly relevant to severely obese patients, in whom a broad spectrum of elevated cardiovascular risk factors often is seen. 

An illustration of the MetAP2 inhibitor mechanism of action and therapeutic effects follows:

For certain of our clinical trials, we performed statistical analysis of our results and report the p-value, which is a statistical calculation that relates to the probability that a difference between groups happened by chance, with a p-value of less than 0.05 (i.e., less than 5% probability that the difference happened by chance) generally being used as the threshold to indicate statistical significance. 

&#160;

In December 2015, the FDA, placed a full clinical hold on our IND for beloranib, as a result of a safety imbalance in the number of thrombotic events observed in patients treated with beloranib in our clinical trials versus placebo. A summary of the adverse events, or AEs, and serious adverse events, or SAEs, related to thrombosis across the ZAF-201, ZAF-203 and ZAF-311 clinical trials is set out below:

Phase 2a Clinical Trials 

ZAF-201&#151;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose Ranging Phase 2 Trial of Beloranib (ZGN-440 for Subcutaneous Injection), A Novel Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 Inhibitor, in Obese Subjects to Evaluate Weight Reduction, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics Over 12 Weeks 

ZAF-201 was a 12-week Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 160 obese patients, of whom 122 were dosed with beloranib, across eight participating trial sites in Australia. 93.8% of patients were female, 97.5% were Caucasian, the average age was 48.4 years and patients had a BMI range of 30-54 kg/m2. Patients were 

&#160;

excluded from this clinical trial if they had been involved recently in another weight loss trial, or if they had clinically significant liver, renal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, oncologic, gastrointestinal disease, or severe mental illness. This clinical trial was designed to evaluate weight loss and responses in metabolic biomarkers over a dose range of beloranib and to assess safety and tolerability of beloranib over 12 weeks in obese patients. This was a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded, parallel design trial to evaluate a range of fixed beloranib doses, including 0.3 mg, 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 2.4 mg and 3.2 mg, in comparison to placebo. All doses were administered as SC injections twice weekly for 12 weeks. 

Trial endpoints included safety and tolerability, weight loss, body composition by bio-impedence, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic assessment. As stipulated in the protocol, our Safety Review Committee for this clinical trial, or SRC, reviewed interim safety and PK results after 36 patients from the initial part of this clinical trial completed at least 2 weeks of treatment. Laboratory, electrocardiogram, and vital sign reviews were deemed to be unremarkable and lacking any significant safety concerns. The SRC recommended to eliminate the lowest and highest active dose groups, 0.3 mg and 3.2 mg, thus leaving the doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 2.4 mg or placebo to be studied in the remainder of this clinical trial. This was based on the conclusion that the weight loss for the 0.3 mg dose was not clinically meaningful and the 3.2 mg dose was not well-tolerated. The most common AE leading to early termination at the 2.4 mg and 3.2 mg dose levels was sleep disturbance. 

As severely obese patients are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, we measured systemic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, including low density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL, CRP, triglycerides and blood pressure in trial participants, to determine beloranib&#146;s impact on such biomarkers. The results of these biomarker measurements in this trial, as summarized below, suggest that beloranib treatment does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and may be associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. While we included biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk as an endpoint for our recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial of beloranib as a treatment for severe obesity in the general population, this trial will not be designed to establish the impact of beloranib treatment on cardiovascular disease risks. 

The key results of this trial are summarized for the Per Protocol population, patients completing the 12-week dosing period and receiving a minimum of 16 of 24 doses, as follows:

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of the cardiovascular disease risk marker C-reactive protein were reduced by an average of 2.5, 2.3 and 1.9 &#181;g/ml, or 23%, 22% and 37%, respectively, for patients treated with beloranib at 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, compared to an average increase of 1.0 &#181;g/ml for patients dosed with placebo (p&#60;0.0001). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-c, were reduced by an average of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol/l, or 9.4%, 14.5% and 29.7%, respectively, for patients treated with beloranib at 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, compared to an average reduction of 0.3 mmol/l for patients dosed with placebo (p&#60;0.001 for patients treated with 2.4 mg beloranib). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-c, were increased by an average of 0.1, 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/l, or 7.6%, 11.6% and 14.6%, respectively, for patients treated with beloranib at 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, compared to no change for patients dosed with placebo (p&#60;0.05 for patients treated with 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg beloranib). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of triglycerides were reduced by an average of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mmol/l, or 8.8%, 9.0% and 20.3%, respectively, for patients treated with beloranib at 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, compared to a reduction of 0.3 mmol/l for patients dosed with placebo (p&#60;0.05 for patients treated with 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg beloranib). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Systolic blood pressure was reduced by an average of 6.3 mmHg, 6.3 mmHg and 13.6 mmHg for patients treated with beloranib at 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, compared to an average of 1.4 mmHg reduction for patients dosed with placebo (p&#60;0.05 for 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg doses). Trends toward reduction in diastolic blood pressure also were observed, although these changes did not reach statistical significance. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sense of hunger was reduced by an average of 1.5 cm, 2.2 cm and 3.3 cm (out of a maximum number of 10 cm using a standardized visual analog scale asking how hungry the participant had been over the prior trial days) compared to an average reduction of 0.1 cm in placebo, respectively (p&#60;0.05 for all doses). Baseline values were, on average, 5.0 cm, 5.3 cm, 5.8 cm and 6.4 cm for placebo, for doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 2.4 mg of beloranib, respectively. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Post hoc analyses suggest that beloranib also may have favorable effects on body fat content. While results from this clinical trial showed that beloranib doses ranging from 0.6 mg to 2.4 mg administered by SC injection resulted in dose-related weight loss, the highest dose, 2.4 mg, was associated with the most significant and rapid onset of weight loss whereas the lower doses, 0.6 mg and 1.2 mg, tended to result in slower initiation of weight reduction. However, the highest dose, 2.4 mg, of beloranib appeared to be less well-tolerated systemically and led to more frequent severe intensity TEAEs. 21 patients treated with 2.4 mg beloranib prematurely withdrew from the trial, mainly due to sleep disturbance reflective of increased sleep latency, the time patients reported taking to fall asleep at night. There were no deaths or any SAEs deemed to be possible, probably or definitely related to beloranib. There were two thrombotic AEs. The most commonly reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, mainly nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting, nervous system disorders, mainly dizziness, and psychiatric disorders, mainly insomnia, sleep disorder, or abnormal dreams. TEAEs were generally mild in severity and transient. Other frequently reported TEAEs were headaches and injection site bruising/itching, although the incidences were comparable to placebo and not observed to be dose-related. Laboratory assessments, vital signs and electrocardiograms revealed no unexplained abnormalities or clinically significant trends. The primary objectives of this clinical trial were met, including demonstration of continued weight loss beyond the four-week trial duration evaluated in prior trials, demonstration of the tolerability profile at effective doses, and demonstration of reductions in key cardiometabolic risk parameters and hunger as well as improved body composition (reduced waist circumference and fat mass) as assessed by bioelectrical impedance. 

ZAF-211&#151;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel Dose Ranging Phase 2a Trial of ZGN-440 (for Subcutaneous Injection), A Novel Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 Inhibitor, in Over-weight and Obese Subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome to Evaluate Weight Reduction, Food-related Behavior, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics Over 4 Weeks Followed by Optional 4-Week Open-Label Extension 

Our Phase 2a clinical trial of beloranib as a potential treatment of PWS was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and parallel comparison of each of 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg dose levels of beloranib, and placebo. 17 adult patients with PWS living in closely-controlled PWS-specific group homes were randomized to one of the three dosing arms, with 6, 5, and 6 patients being randomized to placebo, 1.2 mg beloranib and 1.8 mg beloranib treatment. During the course of the trial, including a two week placebo run-in phase, daily calorie allowances were increased in all patients by 50 percent to drive modest weight gain and simulate the greater access to food experienced in the general PWS population living in family home situations. All patients completed randomized treatment. The primary objectives of this clinical trial were to (i) assess the safety and tolerability of beloranib administered twice weekly SC in patients with PWS, (ii) assess body weight change, changes in body mass and fat content by DEXA, scan analysis, and responses in metabolic biomarkers over a dose range of beloranib, and 

&#160;

(iii) evaluate changes in quality of life, PWS- specific hyperphagia-related behaviors and/or psychiatric status. The secondary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate pharmacodynamics and apparent bioavailability over a dose range of beloranib. The randomized treatment period was followed by an optional open-label extension offering patients the opportunity to continue for an additional four weeks of treatment with 1.8 mg beloranib. 

The key results of this clinical trial are summarized as follows. Both doses of beloranib have been combined as shown below, as a component of the pre-specified statistical analysis:

* Not statistically significant by ANCOVA, or analysis of covariance, a pre-specified statistical analysis, used to assess changes in all key endpoints. ANCOVA is a standard statistical test that takes into account the baseline measurements for each subject. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased by an average of 26% in beloranib-treated patients, compared to an average increase of 1% in patients dosed with placebo (p=0.005). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced by an average of 27% in beloranib-treated patients, compared to an average increase of 3% in patients dosed with placebo (p=0.005). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hyperphagia related behaviors typical of patients with PWS were reduced by an average of 52.4% by treatment with 1.8 mg beloranib, compared to an average increase of 40.5% in patients dosed with placebo and an average increase of 1.8% in patients treated with 1.2 mg beloranib. The change in behavior was statistically significant from baseline for the patients treated with 1.8 mg beloranib (not statistically significant by ANCOVA; p=0.025 by post hoc paired t-test). There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms and vital signs with any of the doses. There were no deaths, SAEs, or severe AEs reported in this clinical trial. Aside from mild and transient injection site reactions, which were observed across all treatment groups, including placebo, SC administration of the drug appeared to be locally well-tolerated. 

Unlike patients with severe obesity in the general population, patients with PWS are missing the function of multiple genes. In order to determine if the underlying mechanistic pathway of beloranib was engaged in patients with PWS, we measured levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and fat mass. MetAP2 inhibitors, such as beloranib, work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress mediators, and, thus, reducing fat synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body, leading to a reduction in cholesterol, evidenced by reduced levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced fat mass. In this clinical trial, patients with PWS treated with beloranib had both reduced levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and fat mass, suggesting that patients with PWS respond to beloranib treatment in a similar manner as severely obese patients that are not missing the function of multiple genes. Likewise, exploratory, salutary effects on behaviors were observed, which reached clinical significance for the 1.8 mg beloranib treatment arm. These behavioral changes include a range of aspects of the PWS phenotype recorded by the caregiver-administered hyperphagia-related behavior questionnaire, an instrument that measures the frequency and severity of behavioral issues typical of patients with PWS that we are currently validating with the FDA for support of our pivotal trials.

ZAF-221&#151;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Phase 2 Trial of ZGN-440 (Subcutaneous Beloranib in Suspension), A Novel Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 Inhibitor, in Obese Subjects with Hypothalamic Injury to Evaluate Weight Reduction and Safety Over 4 Weeks Followed by an Optional 4-Week Open-Label Extension 

Our Phase 2 clinical trial of beloranib as a potential treatment of HIAO was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and parallel comparison of 1.8 mg of beloranib and placebo. This clinical trial was conducted at four trial sites, two in the United States and two in Australia. 14 adult patients, nine female and five male, with magnetic resonance imaging confirmed hypothalamic injury and rapid weight gain following resection of craniopharyngioma (n=13) or pituitary macroadenoma (n=1) were randomized to one of the two dosing arms in a 3:4 ratio, with six and eight patients being randomized to placebo and 1.8 mg beloranib treatment, respectively. The average age of patients was approximately 32 years with an average BMI of 43 kg/m2. All patients assigned to beloranib treatment completed randomized treatment, while one patient assigned to placebo discontinued treatment due to apparent sensitivity to the placebo injectate. The primary objectives of this trial were to (i) assess the safety and tolerability of beloranib administered twice weekly SC, and (ii) assess weight loss effects of beloranib in obese patients with HIAO. The secondary objectives of this trial were to evaluate changes in quality of life and hunger in obese patients with HIAO who have received beloranib, and to assess responses in metabolic biomarkers and plasma exposure to beloranib in obese patients with HIAO. The randomized treatment period was followed by an optional open-label extension offering patients the opportunity to continue for an additional four weeks of treatment with 1.8 mg beloranib. 

The key results of this trial are summarized as follows:

* Patients randomized to placebo received beloranib 1.8 mg twice weekly during the open label extension. Beloranib was well-tolerated in this trial. No consistent new or unanticipated safety issues arose during the course of treatment. There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported in this trial. There were no early trial discontinuations in patients treated with beloranib. Key tolerability findings were mild dizziness. 

The results of this trial suggest that beloranib treatment leads to a similar rapid pace of weight loss in patients with disrupted hypothalamic structures, and therefore provides, further support for the extra-hypothalamic mode of action of beloranib, as well as its differentiation from other weight loss agents that target hypothalamic neuronal activity.

ZAF-203&#151;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Design, Phase 2b Trial of ZGN-440 (Subcutaneous Beloranib in Suspension), A Novel Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 Inhibitor, In Severely Obese Subjects Complicated By Type 2 Diabetes To Evaluate Weight Reduction and Safety Over 26 Weeks Followed By 26 Weeks of a Blinded Controlled Treatment Period 

Our Phase 2b clinical trial of beloranib as a potential treatment of severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and parallel comparison of each of 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg dose levels of beloranib and placebo. In the ZAF-203 clinical trial, 152 patients were randomized and received twice-weekly subcutaneous injections of either 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg of beloranib or placebo, in addition to a diet and exercise regimen. The average age of patients in this trial was approximately 53.5, with patients having an average BMI of 39.9. Sixty-six of the patients completed six months of treatment in compliance with the protocol prior to our suspension of dosing at the time of the partial clinical hold in October 2015. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to assess body weight changes in patients with severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes that received 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg doses of beloranib administered twice weekly. The secondary objectives of this clinical trial were to (i) assess the effects of such doses on glycemic parameters by measuring HbA1c levels in the patient population (ii) evaluate the pharmacokinetics of beloranib, and (iii) assess the proportion of beloranib-treated subjects across weight loss intervals at 26 weeks. 

The key results of this trial are summarized as follows:

These were generally mild and transient in nature and occurred at comparable incidence rates between beloranib and placebo treated patients. Ten patients in the beloranib groups (five in each of the 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg groups) withdrew due to AEs compared to two patients in the placebo group. Consistent with prior beloranib 

&#160;

clinical trials in conventional obesity, the most common causes of AEs leading to early withdrawal were sleep related, leading to four withdrawals from the clinical trial. In the clinical trial, there were a total of nine SAEs identified in eight patients, one in the 1.8 mg group, six in the 1.2 mg group, and two in the placebo group. One of the SAEs was a pulmonary embolism in the 1.2 mg treatment group. During the VTE screening process that followed the FDA&#146;s partial clinical hold of the beloranib IND in October 2015, two additional VTEs were identified in patients in this clinical trial: deep vein thrombosis in a patient who had received 1.8 mg of beloranib, and superficial thrombophlebitis in a patient who had received 1.2 mg of beloranib. 

ZAF-311&#151;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel Designed Phase 3 Trial of ZGN-440 (for Subcutaneous Injection), A Novel Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 Inhibitor, in Over-weight and Obese Subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome to Evaluate Weight Reduction and Hyperphagia-Related Behaviors 

The ZAF-311 clinical trial of beloranib as a treatment for patients with PWS was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and parallel comparison of each of 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg dose levels of beloranib, and placebo. In this trial, 107 patients were randomized and received twice-weekly subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 or 2.4 mg of beloranib or placebo. Seventy-four of the 107 patients completed the full 26 weeks of treatment per the trial protocol, and 27 patients completed at least 75% of the randomized treatment period prior to the suspension of dosing in the trial in October 2015. There were six patients who discontinued early. In agreement with the FDA, we have analyzed the data using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach to account for the missing endpoint data of the patients who did not complete the clinical trial. Patients in the trial were on average 20 years old, had an average BMI of 40 kg/m2 and an average hyperphagia total score of 16.9, consistent with moderate to severe hyperphagia, at the beginning of randomized treatment. These baseline characteristics were well-balanced across the treatment arms. In agreement with the FDA, the primary objectives of this clinical trial were to (i) assess the percent change in body weight across each of the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses of beloranib, and (ii) evaluate the change in hyperphagia-related behaviors assessed via a Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) total score. The HQ-CT is a PWS-specific study instrument that provides an assessment by caregivers of the food-seeking behaviors exhibited by patients, with a high total score representing moderate-to-severe hyperphagia. The secondary objectives of the clinical trial were to (i) evaluate changes in total body fat massed assessed via DEXA scans in the same patient population, and (ii) assess changes in LDL- and HDL-cholesterol. 

The key results of this trial are summarized as follows:

&#160; &#149; &#160; While hyperphagia-related behaviors were stable over six months of treatment in the placebo arm, both the 2.4 mg and 1.8 mg beloranib arms showed highly statistically significant reductions in HQ-CT total score, indicative of reduced hunger-associated behaviors. The most common AEs were injection site bruising, aggression, and hyperphagia, generally of mild and transient nature. Of these, only injection site bruising was notable as being reported more frequently in patients taking beloranib compared to placebo. There were a total of five SAEs; aggression (placebo, 2.4 mg beloranib), ankle fracture (placebo), mental status change (1.8 mg beloranib), and pulmonary embolism which resulted in death (1.8 mg beloranib). Four patients withdrew due to adverse events in the 1.8 mg beloranib treatment group (abnormal behavior, anxiety, mental status changes, and pulmonary embolism) and two patients in the 2.4 mg beloranib group (injection site pain and psychotic disorder). Many of these AEs, specifically psychiatric disorders, are commonly observed as background comorbidities in PWS patients. At the end of the randomized treatment period, there were no clinically significant abnormal patterns regarding laboratory values, vital signs, or ECG findings. There was a patient death due to pulmonary embolism (1.8 mg beloranib) during the randomized portion of the trial. During the open-label extension portion of the trial, there was a patient death associated with pulmonary embolism (2.4 mg beloranib) and two cases of deep vein thrombosis (1.8 mg and 2.4 mg beloranib). 

Next Steps 

We plan to present to the FDA data from our recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating beloranib as a treatment for PWS and our recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial of beloranib in severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes, a proposal for a risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS, and other requested data, in an effort to resolve the full clinical hold the FDA has placed on the beloranib IND. If we are able to reach an agreement with the FDA that an appropriate, safe, and effective path can be developed to support lifting the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND, we anticipate the need to conduct another Phase 3 clinical trial of beloranib in patients with PWS in the United States and likely the European Union, after discussing the trial design with applicable regulatory authorities. 

Our discussions with the FDA will be centered on development of a risk mitigation strategy for beloranib. The recent, unequivocal efficacy data from our Phase 3 trial represent the first of several components needed for our next steps with the FDA to lift the full clinical hold. The FDA is expected to grant us a Type A meeting, which is an important next step toward enhancing our risk mitigation strategy and toward eventually lifting the full clinical hold. We have been working to develop a potential risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS. This effort is well underway and is being informed by experts in the areas of PWS, thrombosis, and regulatory strategy. We will then have the Type A meeting with the FDA regarding the potential path forward for beloranib in PWS. 

Regarding our ongoing data collection to support an integrated benefit/risk assessment, we are in the process of analyzing samples from the ZAF-203 and ZAF-311 trials to assess the baseline thrombotic state of the study populations, and their thrombosis parameters during and following treatment with placebo or beloranib. These analyses will let us dig deeper to see how thrombotic parameters may be influenced during beloranib treatment, and to better understand the context in which thrombotic events have occurred. Importantly, we are looking to understand whether safety can be managed with proper screening and monitoring protocols, or with direct 

&#160;

treatment of thrombotic events with antithrombotic agents, or with prophylactic treatment with antithrombotic agents. We also are running a series of studies in vitro and in animals to see if beloranib causes any changes in thrombosis endpoints. These studies and evaluations are in progress, and will inform our next steps over the coming weeks and months. After we have a full and meaningful view of these results and the Type A meeting with the FDA, we will provide an update. We are also working to understand the incidence of thrombotic events as drivers of mortality and severe morbidity in patients affected by PWS. We are conducting additional surveys, reviewing the scientific literature and data from a natural history study, as well as mining insurance databases to better understand the importance of thromboembolism as a driver of morbidity and mortality in this unique population of patients. Given the depth and breadth of these various studies and analyses, we anticipate that we will have a rich context to draw from regarding thrombosis biology in PWS patients, and regarding any changes that might occur following initiation of treatment with beloranib, as well as what blood markers might be of value in monitoring for thrombotic disease. 

Pre-clinical 

We have conducted toxicology studies of beloranib in support of clinical development. Dose selection and precautions for ongoing clinical trials have been informed by toxicology studies in rats, beagle dogs, and rabbits. Toxicological studies of up to six months in rat and nine months duration in dogs using single, daily or intermittent dosing have established no observed adverse effect levels at higher exposures relative to those in humans. At higher doses in rats and dogs the findings of toxicological importance were inhibition of spermatogenesis (with testicular atrophy/exfoliation of germ cells in testes/epididymides) and hematopoietic suppression including significant reductions in platelet and white blood cell counts, including lymphocytes, thymic, lymph node and splenic atrophy or lymphoid depletion, mild liver and kidney tubular epithelia cell toxicity, gastrointestinal de-epithelialization, hemorrhage/discoloration and diarrhea, and clonic convulsion. Injection site tolerability in both rats and dogs has been demonstrated with several formulations of beloranib and injection site tolerability has been corroborated in clinical trials. A T-cell dependent antibody response study in rats demonstrated that decreases in immunoglobulin responses occurred in males at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and higher, and in females at 3 mg/kg and higher. Collectively, the data indicate that beloranib may be immunosuppressive although events suggesting immunosuppression have not been noted in the clinical trials to date. We plan to measure T-cell and B-cell subpopulations and lymphocyte counts in our ongoing clinical trials until we better understand if there is a potential risk in humans. There were no indications of genotoxicity or specific indicators of phototoxicity with beloranib. Embryo-fetal toxicity findings in rats and rabbits have demonstrated significant embryofetal malformations at exposures similar to those achieved in patients. Therefore, female subjects of child bearing potential should take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy while on treatment. 

Based on the safety findings in animals, clinical trials of beloranib have included monitoring for blood cell changes, sperm counts, sperm morphology and hormones in men, as well as frequent pregnancy testing and requirement for redundant, implanted or surgical methods of birth control in women. To date, the clinical findings have shown no evidence of the hematological or male reproductive findings in humans. We believe that, as with other anti-obesity drugs, if approved, beloranib will carry a Category X label and be contraindicated in pregnant women or women looking to become pregnant. 

We have initiated a two-year carcinogenicity study in the rat which is well underway and have recently completed a six-month transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study for which we expect results in the second quarter of 2016. Given that PWS manifests during childhood, preliminary juvenile safety studies have been completed. Following discussions of the pediatric investigational plan with regulatory authorities we are planning to conduct a confirmatory juvenile safety study to support testing and eventual marketing in the pediatric population. 

&#160;

Future Product Candidates 

We have been working since our inception in 2005 to explore and pursue new molecules leveraging the therapeutic effects of MetAP2 inhibitors in metabolic diseases including severe obesity, type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, and NASH. As a direct result of medicinal chemistry efforts oriented to the identification of best-in-class MetAP2 inhibitors, we have identified compounds of use as potential follow-on compounds supporting beloranib, as well as novel inhibitors with improved pharmacological and physicochemical features. We continue to explore the utility of these molecules as a component of our program, and have identified a range of candidate molecules being prepared for advancement into early development. 

As a part of this effort, we conducted a medicinal chemistry discovery program to find reversible inhibitors of MetAP2 that could be delivered orally and applied broadly across multiple areas of unmet medical need. The program delivered over 250 molecules in seven molecular families, and ZGN-839 was selected from this collection as a potent inhibitor with drug-like properties. In pre-clinical studies, ZGN-839 lowered body weight by approximately 9% after 16 days of treatment versus control animals and reduced plasma cholesterol and glucose, along with improvements in liver fat and the weight of abdominal adipose tissue in mice that were otherwise obese and insulin resistant due to long-term exposure to a high fat, obesogenic, diet. Further, in a mouse model of NAFLD and NASH, ZGN-839 treatment for four weeks reduced the severity of NAFLD and NASH and reduced plasma glucose. We believe that compounds like ZGN-839 could have utility in the treatment of NAFLD and NASH, and will further cause improvements in cardiovascular risk factors including low density lipoprotein cholesterol. 

A synthetic process to produce ZGN-839 for safety testing and clinical trials has been developed. In January 2016, we withdrew the ZGN-839 IND that we previously submitted to the FDA, in order to focus on generating additional data regarding the potential risk of thrombosis. We will decide on next steps with regard to this IND application, following resolution of the full clinical hold on the beloranib IND. 

Additionally, we are currently evaluating other second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors as potential development candidates for the treatment of severe obesity in the general population. In particular, we have initiated nonclinical and pharmacological/toxicological IND enabling studies, many of which are in the reporting phase. These studies are anticipated to support an IND application or other regulatory pathways to facilitate the initiation of clinical testing. These strategies and approaches are required to undergo review by respective health authorities who may require additional work and/or data prior to permitting these clinical development from advancing. 

For information regarding amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research and development activities, see Part II &#147;Item 6&#151;Selected Financial Data&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

Beloranib is a small molecule drug that is synthesized with readily available raw materials using conventional chemical processes. The current process to produce beloranib for clinical trials involves (i) synthesis of crystalline drug substance, (ii) production of sterile crystalline drug substance, (iii) particle size control, formulation and production of sterile active drug product vials, (iv) production of sterile diluent in prefilled syringes and (v) production of sterile placebo vials. We control our clinical trial supply chain by periodically meeting to assess clinical trial material needs and status of supply. Clinical trial materials are forecasted on a six month rolling basis taking into account enrollment rates, number of sites, component inventory and clinical kit shelf-life. The clinical supply forecast is maintained internally and used to aid in decision making for cGMP manufacturing as well as clinical kit packaging and labeling. In addition, the CRO we employ maintains an inventory of all clinical kits that are allocated for a clinical study as well as all components needed for the clinical kits. Our internal cross-functional working group discusses inventory on a regular basis. Distribution of kits to clinical sites is controlled via a validated system thus helping to manage inventory at the CRO. Resupply of finished drug product is in progress at our drug product CMO. The manufacturing process is under active development and is not yet validated. Any delays encountered with manufacturing activities, CMO scheduling or raw material supply could delay the manufacturing of finished drug product. Additionally, 

&#160;

following commercialization, we plan to establish a convenient dosing form of beloranib to improve the utility, look, convenience and feel of beloranib for patients&#151;for example a pen injector system with single-use disposable cartridges. 

We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. No long-term supply agreements are in place with our contractors, and each batch is individually contracted under a work order, which is governed by a quality and supply agreement. If we engage new contractors, such contractors must be approved by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of beloranib, if approved. Our current scale of manufacturing is adequate to support all of our needs for clinical trial supplies and launch for orphan markets. For peak usage in orphan markets and for indications with larger populations, we will need to identify contract manufacturers or partners to produce beloranib on a larger scale. 

Sales and Marketing 

In early 2014, we hired a Chief Commercial Officer, however, given our stage of development, we have not yet established a broad commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure to launch beloranib, we may either do so on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical or other biotechnology company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs and our available resources. 

Licenses 

CKD License 

In July 2009, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. of South Korea, or CKD, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed beloranib from CKD on a worldwide basis, with the exception of South Korea. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee to CKD, paid a one-time fee following initiation of a proof of concept trial, agreed to make milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $7.5 million has been paid, including $3.3 million that was paid in the form of our common stock (valued at $3.6 million) as a result of an amendment to our license agreement and entry into a subscription agreement with CKD) to CKD upon the achievement of certain specified events, and agreed to pay a portion of sublicensing income to CKD. Furthermore, if we receive marketing approval for beloranib, we will pay single-digit royalties to CKD based on annual net sales of beloranib on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the CKD patent rights containing a valid claim covering beloranib or its use for which regulatory approval has been obtained in such country, or (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of beloranib in such country. Pursuant to this agreement, we committed to using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize beloranib. This agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until royalties are no longer due in such country, subject to earlier termination by either party upon mutual consent, or in the event of uncured breach or insolvency on the part of the other party, or by us for any reason up to 60 days&#146; prior notice. 

Children&#146;s License 

In January 2007, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Children&#146;s Medical Center Corporation, or Children&#146;s, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patent rights from Children&#146;s on a worldwide basis. The licensed patent rights relate to decreasing the growth of fat tissue, and thereby cover the use of beloranib and related molecules as anti-obesity agents. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee upon execution of the license to Children&#146;s and annual maintenance fees through the fifth anniversary of the date of the license. We also agreed to make milestone payments to Children&#146;s of up to 

&#160;

$2.7 million (of which $0.4 million has been paid) with respect to the first licensed product and up to $1.3 million with respect to each subsequent licensed product, if any, that is a new chemical entity upon the achievement of certain specified events and to pay a portion of sublicensing income to Children&#146;s. If we receive marketing approval for beloranib, we will pay single-digit royalties to Children&#146;s based on net sales of beloranib until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the licensed patents containing a valid claim covering beloranib or (ii) 15 years from the date of the agreement. This agreement will remain in effect for the longer of (i) 15 years and (ii) the life of the last expiring licensed patent, subject to earlier termination (x) by Children&#146;s in the event of our insolvency or our failure to cure a breach within 60 days (30 days in the case of non-payment) of receiving written notice thereof, or (y) by us for any reason upon 120 days&#146; prior written notice. 

Intellectual Property 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of beloranib and our other development programs. 

Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications relate to beloranib compositions of matter, formulations, polymorphs, methods of treating obesity using dosing regimens of beloranib and methods of treating hypothalamic obesity. The issued U.S. and European patents generally directed to beloranib compositions of matter are exclusively licensed and will each expire in 2019. We own two issued U.S. patents relating to beloranib polymorph compositions of matter that will expire in 2031 and five issued U.S. patents to methods of treating obesity that will expire in 2029. We own pending patent applications in Europe to beloranib polymorph compositions and methods of treating obesity that we expect to expire, once issued, in 2031. 

As of March 7, 2016, we own seven issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications and foreign counterpart applications, and one Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application that will allow us to seek corresponding protection worldwide, all of which relate to beloranib. We have a license to two U.S. issued patents, one with corresponding issued foreign counterpart patents that also relate to beloranib. We also co-own one patent application relating to methods of using beloranib. 

As of March 7, 2016, we own five issued U.S. patents, and 12 pending U.S. patent applications with pending foreign counterpart applications all of which relate to our internal efforts to discover novel MetAP2 inhibitors. Of these, two pending U.S. patent applications, both with pending foreign counterpart patent applications, and two U.S. provisional patent applications relate to our early-stage product candidate ZGN-839. 

As of March 7, 2016, we own two issued patents, three pending U.S. patent applications with pending foreign counterpart patent applications, and four U.S. provisional patent applications that relate to our second-generation injectable MetAP2 inhibitor program. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which 

&#160;

compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents relating to beloranib will expire on dates ranging from 2019 to 2031. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country to country basis for each applicable product and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 

As a result of the America Invents Act of 2011, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in March 2013, under which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. This will require us to minimize the time from invention to the filing of a patent application. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.&#148; 

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial 

&#160;

strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. PTO, to determine priority of invention. 

In addition, substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in third parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published only after 18 months from the priority date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to drugs similar to beloranib and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. These competitors may develop and introduce products and processes comparable or superior to ours. 

Obesity Caused by Rare Conditions 

There are no current pharmacological treatments for regulating hunger and hyperphagia-related behaviors of patients with PWS and patients with HIAO, and bariatric surgery is contraindicated in patients with PWS and not frequently employed in patients with HIAO. We are aware of a clinical trial that has been completed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to evaluate the use of carbetocin, an analogue of a brain peptide hormone oxytocin hypothesized to increase trust, reduce anxiety and improve behavior in patients with PWS. We also are aware of a clinical trial being conducted by Essentialis, Inc. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of controlled-release diazoxide in patients with PWS and to explore the effects of diazoxide on hyperphagia-related behaviors and energy expenditure. We are aware of an exploratory trial being planned, or in its early phase of execution, by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to evaluate the effect of treatment with RM-493, a melanocortin receptor agonist, in patients with PWS. We are not aware of any clinical trials of drugs specifically targeting patients with HIAO. 

Severe Obesity in the General Population 

Surgical Approaches 

Surgical approaches to treat severe obesity are becoming increasingly accepted and are believed to be the main form of competition to beloranib in this indication. Bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass and gastric banding procedures, is typically employed for obese patients with a BMI exceeding 40 kg/m2 or those with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 who are experiencing obesity-related complications such as diabetes. However, in December 2010, the FDA&#146;s Advisory Committee for Gastroenterology and Urology Devices convened and voted in favor of recommending to the FDA that gastric banding procedures be approved for obese patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 who are experiencing obesity related co-morbidities or patients with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 with or without obesity related co-morbidities. Other potential competitors in the severe obesity market include bariatric service providers, and other potential approaches which utilize various implantable devices or surgical tools that have been approved by the FDA, such as EnteroMedics Inc.&#146;s recently FDA-approved 

&#160;

(January 2015) VBlock Therapy, or that are in development by companies such as Allergan, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd., EnteroMedics, Inc., GI Dynamics, Inc., Johnson &#38; Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. 

Existing Obesity Drugs 

In addition, beloranib will compete with orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, Contrave and Saxenda, which are approved and currently marketed pharmaceutical products in the United States for the treatment of obesity, and several older agents, indicated for short-term administration, phentermine, phendimetrazine, benzphetamine and diethylpropion. Orlistat is marketed in the United States by the Roche Group under the brand name Xenical and over-the-counter in the United States at half the prescribed dose by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand name alli. In June 2013, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched its lorcaserin product, which is marketed in the United States under the name Belviq and in September 2012, Vivus, Inc. commercially launched its combination product, phentermine/topiramate, under the trade name Qsymia. In October 2014 Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. and Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. launched Contrave (naltrexone HCI and bupropion HCI) extended-release tablets for chronic weight management in obese adults and in April 2015 Novo Nordisk A/S launched Saxenda for weight management in obese and overweight patients in the presence of at least one related co-morbid condition. 

Despite the large market opportunity for anti-obesity agents, there are relatively few competitive products in late-stage clinical development. Other companies pursuing pharmaceutical treatments for obesity include Neurosearch A/S. 

We are not aware of any clinical trials of drugs specifically targeting patients with severe obesity. 

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as beloranib. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 

U.S. Drug Development 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the implementation of its regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160;

Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a new drug; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#146;s current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 

The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and 

&#160;

rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 

Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

NDA and FDA Review Process 

Following trial completion, trial data is analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product 

&#160;

quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of pre-clinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule, effective through December 31, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2.4 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs ($0.1 million) and an annual establishment fee ($0.6 million) on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. In the case of obesity drugs, the FDA normally refers such drugs to the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP 

&#160;

requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 

There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s 

&#160;

product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 

Expedited Development and Review Programs 

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures. The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 

Pediatric Trials 

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study 

&#160;

objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. Submission of a PSP as defined in FDASIA is not required for programs with orphan drug designation. 

Post-Marketing Requirements 

Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#146;s approved labeling (known as &#147;off-label use&#148;), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 

Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. 

In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 

The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously 

&#160;

unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#146;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#146;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

Other Regulatory Matters 

Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety &#38; Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Health Care Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 

The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 

Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the 

&#160;

remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#147;Written Request&#148; for such a trial. 

European Union Drug Development 

In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 

Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 

&#160;

The European Union clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a revision process mainly aimed at uniforming and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. 

European Union Drug Review and Approval 

In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (excluding Croatia) plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 

The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 

National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 

In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 

&#160;

European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 

In the European Union, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. 

In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Reimbursement 

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. 

Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidate could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 

&#160;

2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#146;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

The Health Care Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any &#147;transfer of value&#148; made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required by ACA to begin tracking this information in 2013 and to report this information to CMS beginning in 2014. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. 

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
