1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information

We design , make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Analog &#8211; consists of the following product lines: High Volume Analog &#38; Logic; Power Management; High Performance Analog; and Silicon Valley Analog, which consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) in 2011. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Embedded Processing &#8211; consists of the following product lines: Microcontrollers, Processors and Connectivity. 

We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP&#174; products, calculators, custom ASICs and royalties received from agreements involving license rights to our patent portfolio.

We also include in Other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include Acquisition charges (see Note 13); restructuring charges (see Note 3); revenue from our legacy wireless products; and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.

Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments&#8217; results and, therefore, is not provided. The assets and liabilities associated with these organizations are included in Other.

With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described below in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.

Geographic area information 

The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination and royalty payor location, and property, plant and equipment, based on physical location. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world.

2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices

Basis of presentation 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein. 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods&#8217; financial statements to conform to the 2015 presentation, including to apply retrospectively the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

A new standard on classifying deferred income taxes (see Changes in accounting standards below and Note 6), and 

&#160;

&#183; 

A new standard on classifying debt issuance costs (see Changes in accounting standards below and Note 11). 

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.

&#160;

Significant accounting policies and practices 

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including direct sales to our distributors, when title and risk of loss pass, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products.

We recognize revenue net of allowances, which are management&#8217;s estimates of f uture credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances may include volume-based incentives, product returns due to quality issues, incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements. For instance, we sell to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities. To estimate allowances, we use statistical percentages of revenue, which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends. Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity. 

We may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slow-selling or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor&#8217;s purchases from us. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor&#8217;s on-hand inventory, we may credit them for the difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor&#8217;s on-hand inventory of that product.

We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. 

Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, including consignment arrangements with distributors, is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above, but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations.

We determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue related to licenses of our patent portfolio based on our contractual agreements with licensees. We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable. 

In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made. 

We recognize shipping fees received from customers in revenue, and we include the shipping and handling costs in COR.

Advertising costs

We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $46 million in 2015, $45 million in 2014 and $46 million in 2013.

Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges may consist of voluntary or involuntary severance-related charges, asset-related charges and other costs due to exit activities. We recognize voluntary termination benefits when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement. We recognize involuntary severance-related charges depending on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. If the former, we recognize the charges once they are probable and the amounts are estimable. If the latter, we recognize the charges once the benefits have been communicated to employees. 

Restructuring activities associated with assets are recorded as an adjustment to the basis of the asset, not as a liability. When we commit to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we accelerate the recognition of depreciation to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. When an asset is held for sale, we write down the carrying value to its net realizable value and cease depreciation. Restructuring actions may be viewed as an impairment indicator requiring testing of the recoverability of intangible assets, including goodwill.

&#160;

Income taxes 

We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Other assessed taxes

Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.

Earnings per share (EPS)

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our restricted stock units (RSUs), are considered to be participating securities and the two-class method is used for purposes of calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, a portion of Net income is allocated to these participating securities and, therefore, is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. 

Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions):

Potentially dilutive securities representing 12 million and 11 million shares of common stock that were outstanding during 2015 and 2014, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive securities to exclude from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during 2013. 

Investments

We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments. Specific details are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

Cash equivalents and short-term investments: We consider investments in debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Long-term investments: Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Classification of investments: Depending on our reasons for holding the investment and our ownership percentage, we classify our investments as either available for sale, trading, equity method or cost method, which are more fully described in Note 8. We determine cost or amortized cos t, as appropriate, on a specific identification basis. &#160;

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. Consigned inventory was $275 million and $258 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs.

Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles and other capitalized costs

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization.

Impairments of long-lived assets

We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles

Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. See Note 9 for additional information.

Foreign currency

The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&#38;E. See Note 13 for additional information.

Derivatives and hedging

We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&#38;E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments.

&#160;

In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we use finan cial derivatives such as treasury rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. 

We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

Changes in accounting standards 

Adopted standards for current period

In April and August 2015, respectively, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , and ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements &#8211; Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting . These standards require that costs associated with the issuance of debt, except for costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, be reported as a direct reduction of the related debt balance. Previously, such costs were recorded as deferred assets. Costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements may continue to be recorded as deferred assets. We adopted these standards as of December 31, 2015, and retrospectively applied the standards to prior periods presented herein. The effect of the reclassification on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is quantified in Note 11. The reclassification we made to address these standards had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This standard requires that companies classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities within a taxing jurisdiction as noncurrent on their consolidated balance sheets. The effect of this new requirement is that deferred income taxes previously reported in either current assets or current liabilities shall be reclassified to noncurrent assets or liabilities. This standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is allowed. We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015, and retrospectively applied it to prior periods presented herein. The effect of the reclassifications on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is quantified in Note 6. 

Standards not yet adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017, for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date. This standard permits early adoption, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016, and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations, as well as our selected transition method. Based on our preliminary assessment, we believe the new standard will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as we do not expect to change the manner or timing of recognizing revenue on a majority of our revenue transactions. We recognize revenue on sales to customers, including sales to distributors, upon satisfaction of our performance obligations when the goods are shipped. For consignment sales, we recognize revenue when the goods are pulled from consignment inventory.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) &#8211; Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which changes the way reporting entities evaluate certain investment holdings for possible consolidation and also includes possible changes in disclosures resulting from that evaluation. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2016, and will have no material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

&#160;

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtop ic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement , which provides guidance on whether a cloud-computing arrangement contains a software license, and whether that license should be accounted for separately as an asset or solel y as a service contract. This standard also aligns the accounting for licenses of internal-use software with the accounting for licenses of other acquired intangible assets. This standard is effective beginning January 1, 2016, and we will adopt it prospec tively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Restructuring charges 

As a result of management&#8217;s decision in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced in January 2016 our intentions to phase out a small, older manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland, over the next three years. Plans are to move production from this facility to more cost-effective 200-millimeter TI manufacturing facilities in Germany, Japan and Maine, resulting in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. Total restructuring charges, primarily severance and related benefit costs associated with the expected reduction of about 350 jobs, are estimated to be about $40 million. We recognized charges of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The remaining charges are expected to be recognized over the next three years. As of December 31, 2015, no payments have been made.

The 2014 and 2013 restructuring charges related to prior actions in Embedded Processing, Japan, our former Wireless business and factory closures in Houston, Texas, and Hiji, Japan. These actions have been completed.

The $32 million as of December 31, 2015 is composed of $17 million related to the 2015 action and $15 million related to prior actions.

&#160;

Other 

Gains on sales of assets 

We recognized $83 million of gains on sales of assets in 2015. This included $48 million associated with the sale of a site in Plano, Texas, and $34 million associated with the sale of a manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas.

We recognized $75 million of gains on sales of assets in 2014. This consisted of $30 million associated with the sale of a site in Nice, France; $28 million associated with the sales of real estate in Santa Clara, California; and $17 million of asset sales associated primarily with the factory closures in Houston, Texas, and Hiji, Japan.

Gain on technology transfer

During 2013, we recognized a gain of $315 million on the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This technology was associated with the former Wireless business.

&#160;

&#160;

4. Stock-based compensation

We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. We also have assumed stock options that were granted by companies that we later acquired. Unless the options are acquisition-related replacement options, the option price per share may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Substantially all the options have a 10 -year term and vest ratably over four years. Our options generally continue to vest after the option recipient retires.

We also have RSUs outstanding under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on the vesting date , which is generally four years after the date of grant. Upon vesting, the shares are issued without payment by the grantee. Beginning with 2013 grants, RSUs generally continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of most RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock.

We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred compensation accounts established for such directors.

We also have an employee stock purchase plan under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee&#8217;s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 percent of the fair market value on the exercise date, and options have a three -month term.

Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:

These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our employee stock purchase plan and are net of expected forfeitures.

We issue awards of non-qualified stock options with graded vesting provisions (e.g., 25 percent per year for four years). Generally, we recognize the related compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for expected forfeiture activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. 

Our RSUs generally vest four years after the date of grant. We recognize the related compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, adjusting for expected forfeiture activity. Beginning with 2013 grants, RSUs issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. 

&#160;

Fair-value methods and assumptions 

We account for all awards granted under our various stock-based compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions.

We determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. 

We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling 10- year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available.

Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero -coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options.

Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term.

The fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.

Our employee stock purchase plan is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount.

5. Profit sharing plans

Profit sharing benefits are generally formulaic and determined by one or more subsidiary or company-wide financial metrics. We pay profit sharing benefits primarily under the company-wide TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan. This plan provides for profit sharing to be paid based solely on TI&#8217;s operating margin for the full calendar year. Under this plan, TI must achieve a minimum threshold of 10 percent operating margin before any profit sharing is paid. At 10 percent operating margin, profit sharing will be 2 percent of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is 20 percent of eligible payroll, which is paid only if TI&#8217;s operating margin is at or above 35 percent for a full calendar year.

We recognized $309 million , $269 million and $161 million of profit sharing expense under the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The total provision for 2013 in the reconciliation above includes $79 million of discrete tax benefits primarily for the reinstatement of the U.S. R&#38;D tax credit retroactive to 2012 . 

Our annual effective tax rate benefits from lower rates (compared to the U.S. statutory rate) applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and from U.S. tax benefits. These lower non-U.S. tax rates are generally statutory in nature, without expiration and available to companies that operate in those taxing jurisdictions. Also included in the non-U.S. effective tax rates reconciling item above are benefits from tax holidays of $60 million , $44 million and $40 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax benefits relate to our operations in Malaysia and the Philippines, and expire in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The terms of the Malaysia tax holiday are currently under governmental review as required for the end of the first five years of the holiday period. We do not expect any potential change in the holiday to have a material impact on the financial statements.

As a result of our early adoption of ASU 2015-17 , Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , we have adjusted the presentation of deferred taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have retrospectively adjusted the 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheets to conform to the 2015 presentation by reclassifying current deferred income tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The effect of applying the new standard, as shown in the following table, is the result of netting Current deferred income tax assets with Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities, by tax jurisdiction. See Note 2 for additional information.

We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Changes in valuation allowance balances in the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $9 million, $24 million and $2 million, respectively, had no impact on Net income. 

We have U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately $35 million , none of which will expire before the year 2025.

A provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from these subsidiaries are expected to result in additional tax liability. The remaining undistributed earnings of approximately $8.35 billion at December 31, 2015 , have been indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States; therefore, no U.S. tax provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings. The indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are primarily invested in working capital and property, plant and equipment. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 

&#160;

Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 1.167 billion , $1.104 billion and $ 569 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Uncertain tax positions 

We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements, we must determine that it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&#38;E.

The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are summarized as follows:

The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

All of the $84 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015, is comprised of positions that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized, $12 million of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized, related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation. It is reasonably possible that the liability could increase in 2016 by up to $150 million for a tax depreciation-related position. The increase would offset the tax benefit realized with no net profit impact. 

All of the $108 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014 , is comprised of positions that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized, $56 million of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized, primarily related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation.

As of December 31, 2015 , the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2010 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2009 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation and the review of refunds claimed on amended returns for years prior to 2010. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2006 through 2009.

In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007.

&#160;

&#160;

7. Financial instruments and risk concentration

Financial instruments 

We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2015 . Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , had a notional value of $464 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 175 million to sell Japanese yen and $139 million to sell euros.

&#160;

Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, a s well as our postretirement plan assets and deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 8 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 input s. 

Risk concentration 

We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. 

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Details of these accounts receivable allowances are as follows:

8. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities

Debt and equity investments 

We classify our investments as either available for sale, trading, equity method or cost method. Most of our investments are classified as available for sale. 

Available-for-sale and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See the fair-value discussion below. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities in OI&#38;E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 

We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&#38;A. 

Our other investments are not measured at fair value but are accounted for using either the equity method or cost method. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are reflected in OI&#38;E based on our ownership share of the investee&#8217;s financial results. Gains and losses on cost-method investments are recorded in OI&#38;E when realized or when an impairment of the investment&#8217;s value is warranted based on our assessment of the recoverability of each investment.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $2.89 billion , $2.97 billion and $4.25 billion , respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material.

Gross realized gains and losses from sales of long-term investments were not material for 2015, 2014 and 2013. Other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of these investments recognized in OI&#38;E were not material in 2015, 2014 and 2013 .

Fair-value considerations 

We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements.

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 1 &#8211; Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 2 &#8211; Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 3 &#8211; Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are gene rally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities, other than certain assets held by our postretirement plans . &#160;

The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.

We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value is based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we determined no impairment was indicated. See Note 8 for additional information.

10. Postretirement benefit plans

Plan descriptions 

We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. 

U.S. retirement plans

Our principal retirement plans in the U.S. are a defined contribution plan; an enhanced defined contribution plan; and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then-current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans, or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described below.

Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pre-tax contributions to various investment choices, including a TI common stock fund. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employee&#8217;s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans, and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee&#8217;s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employee&#8217;s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee&#8217;s annual eligible earnings. 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, as a result of employees&#8217; elections, TI&#8217;s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 13 million shares and 14 million shares valued at $704 million and $740 million , respectively. Dividends paid on these shares for both 2015 and 2014 were $19 million .

Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $60 million in both 2015 and 2014 and $62 million in 2013.

&#160;

The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of s ervice and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qual ified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. 

U.S. retiree health care benefit plan

U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee&#8217;s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan&#8217;s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement.

Non-U.S. retirement plans

We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee&#8217;s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, as a result of employees&#8217; elections, TI&#8217;s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $17 million . Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock for 2015 and 2014 were not material.

For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years.

&#160;

Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans were as follows:

Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $100 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2016. The amounts shown for underfunded U.S. defined benefit plans were for non-qualified pension plans, which we do not fund because contributions to them are not tax deductible. 

&#160;

Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $9 4 8 million and $968 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the U.S. defined ben efit plans, and $2. 09 billion and $2.15 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans. 

The amounts recorded in AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, are detailed below by plan type:

The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. For the U.S. plans, we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on investments in U.S. equity funds. 

&#160;

The only Level 3 asset in our worldwide benefit plans for the periods presented is a diversified property fund in a non-U.S. pension plan; we sold assets related to private equity limited partnerships in our U.S. pension plan in 2014. These investments are valued using inputs from the fund managers and internal models. 

&#160;

The following table summarizes the change in the fair values for Level 3 plan assets for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014:

We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan&#8217;s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate. 

Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans&#8217; investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries.

The table below shows target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets.

None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. As of December 31, 2015 , we do not expect to return any of the defined benefit pension plans&#8217; assets to TI in the next 12 months.

&#160;

&#160;

The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations and assume that retirement eligible participants take their benefits immediately. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from compan y assets.

A one percentage point increase or decrease in health care cost trend rates over all future periods would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan at December 31, 2015 , by $8 million . The service cost and interest cost components of 2015 plan expense would have increased by $2 million or decreased by $1 million . 

Deferred compensation arrangements 

We have a deferred compensation plan that allows U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under this plan are made based on the participant&#8217;s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans.

As of December 31, 2015 , our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $198 million and is recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. As of December 31, 2015, we held $187 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in Long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and serve as an economic hedge against changes in fair values of our other deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related investment in SG&#38;A as discussed in Note 8. 

&#160;

&#160;

11. Debt and lines of credit

Short-term borrowings 

We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2020. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2015 , our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding.

Long-term debt 

We retired $250 million of maturing debt in April 2015 and another $750 million in August 2015. 

In May 2015, we issued a principal amount of $500 million of fixed-rate long-term debt due in 2020. We incurred $3 million of issuance and other related costs, which are amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt. The proceeds of the offering were $498 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used toward the repayment of a portion of the debt that matured in August 2015. 

&#160;

In March 2014, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of fixed-rate long-term debt, with $250 million due in 2017 and $250 million due in 2021. We incurred $3 million of issuance and other related costs, which are amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt. The proceeds of the offering were $498 million, net of the origi nal issuance discount and were used toward the repayment of the $1.0 billion of debt that matured in May 2014. 

In May 2013 , we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of fixed-rate long-term debt, with $500 million due in 2018 and $500 million due in 2023. We incurred $6 million of issuance and other related costs, which are amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt. The proceeds of the offering were $986 million, net of the original issuance discount and were used toward the repayment of $1.5 billion of maturing debt, including floating-rate notes. In connection with this repayment, we settled a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap associated with the maturing debt. 

Long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:

As of December 31, 2015, we retrospectively applied the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 regarding the classification of debt issuance costs. See Note 2 for additional information. As a result, we reclassified $11 million of applicable debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2014, from Other assets to Long-term debt, as comprehended in Net unamortized (discount) premium and debt issuance costs, in the table above.

Interest and debt expense was $90 million in 2015, $94 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013. This was net of the amortization of the debt (discount) premium and other debt issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $99 million in 2015 and $102 million in both 2014 and 2013. Capitalized interest was not material.

&#160;

&#160;

12. Commitments and contingencies

Operating leases 

We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal provisions and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Rental and lease expense incurred was $ 98 million , $ 113 million and $120 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Capitalized software licenses 

We have licenses for certain internal-use electronic design automation software that we account for as capital leases. The related liabilities are apportioned between Accounts payable and Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the contractual timing of payments.

Purchase commitments 

Some of our purchase commitments entered in the ordinary course of business provide for minimum payments. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 , we had committed to make the following mini mum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases, capitalized software licenses and purchase commitments:

Indemnification guarantees 

We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result.

Warranty costs/product liabilities 

We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Typically, our warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer.

13. Supplemental financial information

Acquisition charges 

We incurred various costs as a result of the 2011 acquisition of National that are included in Other for segment reporting purposes, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Acquisition charges were primarily from the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the National acquisition. See Note 9 for additional information.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Texas Instruments Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Texas Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities effective December 31, 2015.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
