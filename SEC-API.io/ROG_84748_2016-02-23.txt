Overview 

Rogers Corporation (NYSE: ROG) designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-quality and high-reliability engineered materials and components for mission critical applications. We operate principally three strategic business segments-Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS), Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS) and Power Electronics Solutions (PES). We have a history of innovation and established the Rogers Innovation Center for our leading research and development activities. 

Our growth strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. As a market-driven organization, we are focused on three megatrends of expanding business opportunities: Internet Connectivity, Clean Energy and Safety &#38; Protection. During 2015, we added the Safety &#38; Protection megatrend in place of Mass Transit in response to the increase in demand for advanced driver assistance systems and growth in products focused on consumer impact protection, passenger safety and vibration management and flexible heater insulation. 

In January 2015, we completed the acquisition of Arlon LLC and its subsidiaries, other than Arlon India (Pvt) Limited (the acquired subsidiaries, collectively, Arlon), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $157 million. Arlon manufactures high performance materials for the printed circuit board industry and silicone rubber-based materials. The acquisition of Arlon and its subsequent integration into our business segments have enabled us to increase scale and complement our existing product offerings, thus enhancing our ability to support our customers. The Arlon polyimide and thermoset laminate business, which was not integrated, was sold in December 2015. For additional information regarding the Arlon acquisition and related financing, see Note 5, &#8220;Acquisition&#8221; and Note 12, &#8220;Debt&#8221; in &#8220;Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Rogers was founded in 1832 and incorporated in Massachusetts in 1927.

Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS) 

Our ACS segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells circuit materials enabling high-performance and high-reliability connectivity for applications including communications infrastructure (e.g., cellular communication antennas and equipment), automotive (e.g., advanced driver assistance systems and global positioning applications), consumer electronics and aerospace/defense. We sell our circuit materials under various tradenames, including RO3000&#174;, RO4000&#174;, RT/duroid&#174;, ULTRALAM&#174;, RO2800&#174;, LoPro&#174;, COOLSPAN&#174; and TMM&#174;. In January 2015, we acquired the Arlon business, and subsequently integrated a portion of the product portfolio into the ACS segment operations and products that expanded the segment&#8217;s product portfolio, market reach and customer base, particularly in the RF antenna business. 

Our ACS segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Chandler, Arizona; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Evergem, Belgium; and Suzhou, China. 

Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS) 

Our EMS segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells elastomeric material solutions for critical cushioning, sealing, impact protection and vibration management applications including general industrial, portable electronics (e.g., mobile internet devices), consumer goods (e.g., protective sports equipment), automotive, mass transportation, construction and printing applications. We sell our elastomeric materials under various trade names, including PORON&#174;, XRD&#174;, BISCO&#174; and eSORBA&#174;. In January 2015, we acquired the Arlon business, and subsequently integrated a portion of the product portfolio into the EMS segment operations and products that expanded the segment&#8217;s product portfolio, market reach and customer base, particularly in the engineered silicones for sealing and insulation applications. 

Our EMS segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Woodstock, Connecticut; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; and Suzhou, China. We also own 50% of: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture that was established in Japan 1989 to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS) that was established in China in 2004 to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products primarily for RIC customers in China. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers&#8217; facilities in Suzhou, China. 

Power Electronics Solutions (PES) 

Our PES segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells ceramic substrate materials for power module applications (e.g., variable frequency drives, vehicle electrification and renewable energy), laminated bus bars for power inverter and high power interconnect applications (e.g., mass transit, hybrid-electric and electric vehicles, renewable energy and variable frequency drives), and micro-channel coolers (e.g., laser cutting equipment). We sell our ceramic substrate materials and micro channel coolers under the curamik&#174; tradename, and our bus bars under the ROLINX&#174; tradename. 

Our PES segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Ghent, Belgium; Eschenbach, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Suzhou, China. 

Other 

Our Other businesses consist of elastomeric components for applications in ground transportation, office equipment, consumer and other markets; elastomeric floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks; and inverters for portable communications and automotive markets. In 2015, the Other businesses included the Arlon polyimide and thermoset laminate operations, which was sold in December 2015. 

Sales and Competition 

We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to over 3,000 customers worldwide in 2015, primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 3.9% of our total sales for 2015; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our ACS (Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers) and PES (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers) segments. Although the loss of all of the sales made to any one of our larger customers would require a period of adjustment during which the results of a particular operating segment would be adversely impacted, we believe that such adjustments could be successfully made over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base. We believe that our business relationships with major customers in our key markets are favorable, and that we are in a good position to respond promptly to variations in customer requirements and technology trends. 

We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Particularly in our ACS and EMS business segments, component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers. 

We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, customer relationships, product quality and performance, technical service, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the quality and reliability of our materials and components and our demonstrated commitment to technical support and customer service. 

Research and Development 

We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in research and development. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as other long term initiatives targeted at further diversifying our business. As part of this technology commitment, we established the Rogers Innovation Center at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, and, in 2015, opened a satellite innovation center at our facility in Suzhou, China. Our innovation centers focus on the earliest stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in close alignment with market needs. 

Patents and Other Intellectual Property 

We have many domestic and foreign patents and licenses and have additional patent applications on file related to all business segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition. 

We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technology, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business. 

While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide some important advantage to our business segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success is also determined by such factors as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range and success of new products we develop; and our customer service and support. 

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our ACS segment, copper and polymer materials; for our EMS segment, polyurethane and silicone materials; and for our PES segment, copper and ceramic materials. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of these key raw materials for our manufacturing needs. 

Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through single or limited-source suppliers. We recently expanded our supplier base for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency, cost reduction and quality, while limiting the number of suppliers who act as the single-source supplier for a particular raw material. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw material supply disruptions by purchasing sufficient quantities of the particular raw material in advance to sustain production until alternative materials and production processes can be qualified with customers. However, this strategy may not be effective in all cases, and disruptions in our supply of raw materials could negatively impact our production and have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Seasonality 

There is no material concentration of products or markets within the business that are seasonal in nature, except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often align with year-end holidays and product launch cycles. 

Our Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 2,800 &#32;people. 

Backlog 

Our backlog of firm orders was $63.3 &#32;million as of December 31, 2015 , as compared to $77.0 &#32;million as of December 31, 2014 . The decrease at the end of 2015 &#32;was primarily related to Power Electronics Solutions and Advanced Connectivity Solutions and our which experienced decreases &#32;in backlog of $7.3 &#32;million, $(9.1) &#32;million, respectively. These declines were slightly offset by Elastomeric Material Solutions, which experienced an increase of $2.8 million &#32;in the backlog. Contributing to the year-over-year change in backlog were customer delivery improvements, which reduced customer ordering cycles, combined with general market conditions. Additionally, the 2015 backlog contains $7.4 million related to the Arlon businesses. The backlog of firm orders is expected to be filled within the next 12 months.
