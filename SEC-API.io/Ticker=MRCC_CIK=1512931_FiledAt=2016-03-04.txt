 ITEM 1. BUSINESS FORMATION OF OUR COMPANY We are a Maryland corporation, formed February 9, 2011, for the purpose of purchasing an initial portfolio of loans from two funds managed by Monroe Capital, raising capital in our initial public offering, which was completed in October 2012 (the &#147;Initial Public Offering&#148;) and thereafter operating as an externally managed business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;), as amended. We are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. 

Prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we purchased our initial portfolio of loans for $67.5 million from two funds managed by Monroe Capital, which was comprised of 16 loans that were either senior secured debt, junior secured debt or unitranche secured debt (a combination of senior secured debt and junior secured debt under the same facility) obligations of companies that we believe provided us with a sound foundation for our business. Our board of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) determined the purchase price for our initial portfolio based on the aggregate fair value of the assets in the initial portfolio and the disinterested members of our Board approved the transaction as being fair to us. 

The Initial Public Offering consisted of the sale of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $84.6 million. On July 22, 2013, we completed a public offering of an additional 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $14.05 per share. On August 20, 2013, we also sold an additional 225,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $14.05 per share pursuant to the underwriters&#146; partial exercise of the over-allotment option. These issuances during the year ended December 31, 2013 provided us with proceeds, net of offering and underwriting costs, of $56.0 million. 

On February 6, 2015, we entered into an at-the-market (&#147;ATM&#148;) securities offering program with MLV &#38; Co. LLC and JMP Securities LLC through which we may sell, by means of ATM offerings from time to time, up to $50.0 million of our common stock. We have sold 672,597 shares under the ATM program through December 31, 2015, raising approximately $10.0 million in gross proceeds ($9.8 million, net of transaction and offering costs). On April 20, 2015, we closed a public offering of 2,450,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $36.4 million in gross proceeds. On May 18, 2015, we completed the sale of an additional 367,500 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $5.5 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters&#146; exercise of the over-allotment option. These non-ATM program issuances during the year ended December 31, 2015 provided us with proceeds, net of offering and underwriting costs, of $39.9 million. 

On February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Capital Corporation SBIC, LP (&#147;MRCC SBIC&#148;), a Delaware limited partnership, received a license from the Small Business Administration (&#147;SBA&#148;) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (&#147;SBIC&#148;) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had $20.0 million in regulatory and leveragable capital and $40.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. 

&#160;

&#160;

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS We are a specialty finance company focused on providing financing primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior secured, junior secured and unitranche (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility) debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock and warrants. 

Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through investment in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity investments. We seek to use our extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to middle-market companies. We believe that our primary focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, more comprehensive and restrictive covenants, more expansive events of default, relatively small debt facilities that provide us with enhanced influence over our borrowers, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow. 

Since the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we have grown the fair value of our portfolio of investments to approximately $341.1 million at December 31, 2015. Our portfolio at December 31, 2015 consists of 55 different portfolio companies and holdings include senior secured, junior secured and unitranche debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, we have borrowed $123.7 million under our revolving credit facility and drawn $40.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures to finance the purchase of our assets. 

Our investments in senior, unitranche, junior secured debt and other investments generally will range between $2.0 million and $18.0 million each, although this investment size may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio included approximately 55.9% senior secured debt, 20.0% unitranche secured debt, 18.6% junior secured debt and 5.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s system) from the national rating agencies. 

While our primary focus is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through debt investments in thinly traded or private U.S. companies, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. 

OUR INVESTMENT ADVISOR Our investment activities are managed by our investment advisor, MC Advisors. MC Advisors is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments and their private equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and managing our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. MC Advisors was organized in February 2011 and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;). 

Under our Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, we pay MC Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. While not expected to review or approve each investment, our independent directors periodically review MC Advisors&#146; services and fees as well as its portfolio management decisions and portfolio performance. In connection with these reviews, our independent directors consider whether our fees and expenses (including those related to leverage) remain appropriate. 

MC Advisors seeks to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Monroe Capital&#146;s investment professionals. The senior management team of Monroe Capital, including Theodore L. Koenig and Aaron D. Peck, provides investment services to MC Advisors pursuant to a staffing agreement, or the Staffing 

&#160;

&#160;

Agreement, between MC Management, an affiliate of Monroe Capital, and MC Advisors. Messrs. Koenig and Peck have developed a broad network of contacts within the investment community and average more than 20 years of experience investing in debt and equity securities of lower middle-market companies. In addition, Messrs. Koenig and Peck have extensive experience investing in assets that constitute our primary focus and have expertise in investing throughout all periods of the economic cycle. MC Advisors is an affiliate of Monroe Capital and is supported by experienced investment professionals of Monroe Capital under the terms of the Staffing Agreement. Monroe Capital&#146;s core team of investment professionals has an established track record in sourcing, underwriting, executing and monitoring transactions. From Monroe Capital&#146;s formation in 2004 through December 31, 2015, Monroe Capital&#146;s investment professionals invested in over 900 loan and related investments with an aggregate principal value of over $5.0 billion. 

In addition to their roles with Monroe Capital and MC Advisors, Messrs. Koenig and Peck serve as interested directors. Mr. Koenig has more than 25 years of experience in structuring, negotiating and closing transactions on behalf of asset-backed lenders, commercial finance companies, financial institutions and private equity investors at organizations including Monroe Capital, which Mr. Koenig founded in 2004, and Hilco Capital LP, where he led investments in over 30 companies in the lower middle-market. Mr. Peck has more than 20 years of public company management, leveraged finance and commercial lending experience at organizations including Deerfield Capital Management LLC, Black Diamond Capital Management LLC and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Messrs. Koenig and Peck are joined on the investment committee of MC Advisors by Michael J. Egan and Jeremy T. VanDerMeid, each of whom is a senior investment professional at Monroe Capital. Mr. Egan has more than 20 years of experience in commercial finance, credit administration and banking at organizations including Hilco Capital, The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc., The National Community Bank of New Jersey (The Bank of New York) and KeyCorp. Mr. VanDerMeid has more than 15 years of lending and corporate finance experience at organizations including Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Dymas Capital Management Company, LLC and Heller Financial. 

ABOUT MONROE CAPITAL Monroe Capital, a Delaware limited liability company that was founded in 2004, is a leading lender to middle-market companies. As of December 31, 2015, Monroe Capital had approximately $3.1 billion in assets under management. Monroe Capital has maintained a continued lending presence in the lower middle-market throughout the most recent economic downturn. The result is an established lending platform that we believe generates consistent primary and secondary deal flow from a network of proprietary relationships and additional deal flow from a diverse portfolio of over 400 current investments. From Monroe Capital&#146;s formation in 2004 through December 31, 2015, Monroe Capital&#146;s investment professionals invested in over 900 loans and related investments with an aggregate principal value of over $5.0 billion. The senior investment team of Monroe Capital averages more than 20 years of experience and has developed a proven investment and portfolio management process that has performed through multiple market cycles. In addition, Monroe Capital&#146;s investment professionals are supported by administrative and back-office personnel focused on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. 

INVESTMENT STRATEGY Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation primarily through investments in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity. We also seek to invest opportunistically in attractively priced, broadly syndicated loans, which should enhance our geographic and industry portfolio diversification and increase our portfolio&#146;s liquidity. To achieve our investment objective, we utilize the following investment strategy: 

Attractive Current Yield. We believe our sourcing network allows us to enter into transactions with attractive yields and investment structures. Based on current market conditions and our pipeline of new investments, we expect our target directly originated senior and unitranche secured debt will have an average maturity of three to five years and interest rates of 8% to 13%, and we expect our target directly originated junior secured debt and unsecured subordinated debt will have an average maturity of four to seven years and interest rates of 10% to 15%. In addition, based on current market conditions and our pipeline of new 

&#160;

&#160;

investments, we expect that our target debt investments will typically have a variable coupon (with a LIBOR floor), will typically include upfront closing fees of 1% to 4% and may include payment-in-kind (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest (interest that is not received in cash, but added to the principal balance of the loan). We may also receive warrants or other forms of upside equity participation. Our transactions are generally secured and supported by a lien on all assets and/or a pledge of company stock in order to provide priority of return and to influence any corporate actions. Although we will target investments with the characteristics described in this paragraph, we cannot assure you that our new investments will have these characteristics and we may enter into investments with different characteristics as the market dictates. For a description of the characteristics of our current investment portfolio, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Portfolio and Investment Activity.&#148; Until investment opportunities can be found, we may invest our undeployed capital in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. These temporary investments may have lower yields than our other investments and, accordingly, may result in lower distributions, if any, during such period. 

Sound Portfolio Construction. We strive to exercise discipline in portfolio creation and management and to implement effective governance throughout our business. Monroe Capital has been, and MC Advisors, which is comprised by substantially the same investment professionals who have operated Monroe Capital, is, and we believe will continue to be, conservative in the underwriting and structuring of covenant packages in order to enable early intervention in the event of weak financial performance by a portfolio company. We seek to pursue lending opportunities selectively and to maintain a diversified portfolio. We believe that exercising disciplined portfolio management through continued intensive account monitoring and timely and relevant management reporting allows us to mitigate risks in our debt investments. In addition, we have implemented rigorous governance processes through segregation of duties, documented policies and procedures and independent oversight and review of transactions, which we believe helps us to maintain a low level of non-performing loans. We believe that Monroe Capital&#146;s proven process of thorough origination, conservative underwriting, due diligence and structuring, combined with careful account management and diversification, enabled it to protect investor capital, and we believe MC Advisors follows and will follow the same philosophy and processes in originating, structuring and managing our portfolio investments. 

Predictability of Returns. Beyond conservative structuring and protection of capital, we seek a predictable exit from our investments. We seek to invest in situations where there are a number of potential exit options, including rapid amortization and excess cash-flow recapture resulting in full repayment or a modest refinance. We seek to structure the majority of our transactions as secured loans with a covenant package that provides for full or partial repayment upon the completion of asset sales and restructurings. Because we seek to structure these transactions to provide for contractually determined, periodic payments of principal and interest, we are less likely to depend on merger and acquisition activity or public equity markets to exit our debt investments. As a result, we believe that we can achieve our target returns even in a period when public markets are depressed. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY We believe that we represent an attractive investment opportunity for the following reasons: 

Deep, Experienced Management Team. We are managed by MC Advisors, which has access through the Staffing Agreement to Monroe Capital&#146;s experienced team comprised of approximately 60 professionals, including six senior partners that average more than 20 years of direct lending experience. We are led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Theodore L. Koenig, and Aaron D. Peck, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer. This extensive experience includes the management of investments with borrowers of varying credit profiles and transactions completed in all phases of the credit cycle. Monroe Capital&#146;s senior investment professionals provide us with a difficult-to-replicate sourcing network and a broad range of transactional, financial, managerial and investment skills. This expertise and experience is supported by administrative and back office personnel focused on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. From Monroe Capital&#146;s formation in 2004 through December 31, 2015, Monroe Capital&#146;s investment professionals invested in more than 900 loan and related investments with an aggregate principal value of over $5.0 billion. 

&#160;

&#160;

Differentiated Relationship-Based Sourcing Network. We believe Monroe Capital&#146;s senior investment professionals benefit from extensive relationships with commercial banks, private equity firms, financial intermediaries, management teams and turn-around advisors. We believe that this broad sourcing network differentiates us from our competitors and offers us a diversified origination approach that does not rely on a single channel and offers us consistent deal flow throughout the economic cycle. We also believe that this broad network allows us to originate a substantial number of non-private equity-sponsored investments. 

Extensive Institutional Platform for Originating Middle-Market Deal Flow. Monroe Capital&#146;s broad network of relationships and significant origination resources enable us to review numerous lending opportunities, permitting us to exercise a high degree of selectivity in terms of loans to which we ultimately commit. Monroe Capital estimates that it reviewed approximately 1,700 investment opportunities during 2015. Monroe Capital&#146;s over 900 previously executed transactions, over 400 of which are with current borrowers, offer us another source of deal flow, as these debt investments reach maturity or seek refinancing. As of December 31, 2015, Monroe Capital had a pipeline of more than 250 transactions for an aggregate potential deal volume of greater than $5.0 billion for all funds under management. We are also positioned to benefit from Monroe Capital&#146;s established brand name, strong track record in partnering with industry participants and reputation for closing deals on time and as committed. Monroe Capital&#146;s senior investment professionals are complemented by extensive experience in capital markets transactions, risk management and portfolio monitoring. 

Disciplined, &#147;Credit-First&#148; Underwriting Process. Monroe Capital has developed a systematic underwriting process that applies a consistent approach to credit review and approval, with a focus on evaluating credit first and then appropriately assessing the risk-reward profile of each loan. MC Advisors&#146; assessment of credit outweighs pricing and other considerations, as we seek to minimize potential credit losses through effective due diligence, structuring and covenant design. MC Advisors seeks to customize each transaction structure and financial covenant to reflect risks identified through the underwriting and due diligence process. We also seek to actively manage our origination and credit underwriting activities through personal visits and calls on all parties involved with an investment, including the management team, private equity sponsors, if any, or other lenders. 

Established Credit Risk Management Framework. We seek to manage our credit risk through a well-defined portfolio strategy and credit policy. In terms of credit monitoring, MC Advisors assigns each loan to a particular portfolio management professional and maintains an internal credit rating analysis for all loans. MC Advisors then employs ongoing review and analysis, together with monthly investment committee meetings to review the status of certain complex and challenging loans and a comprehensive quarterly review of all loan transactions. MC Advisors&#146; investment professionals also have significant turnaround and debt work-out experience, which gives them perspective on the risks and possibilities throughout the entire credit cycle. We believe this careful approach to investment and monitoring enables us to identify problems early and gives us an opportunity to assist borrowers before they face difficult liquidity constraints. By anticipating possible negative contingencies and preparing for them, we believe that we diminish the probability of underperforming assets and loan losses. 

INVESTMENTS Investment Structure We structure our investments, which typically have maturities of three to seven years, as follows: 

Senior Secured Loans. We structure senior secured loans to obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company borrowers that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral may take the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company borrower. Our senior secured loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 

&#160;

&#160;

Unitranche Loans. We structure our unitranche loans as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Unitranche loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Unitranche loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In many cases we, together with our affiliates, are the sole or majority lender of our unitranche loans, which can afford us additional influence with a borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediation in the event of underperformance. 

Junior Secured Loans. We structure junior secured loans to obtain a security interest in the assets of these portfolio companies that serves as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral may take the form of second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. These loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 

Preferred Equity . We generally structure preferred equity investments to combine features of equity and debt. We may obtain a security interest in the assets of these portfolio companies that serves as collateral in support of the repayment of such preferred equity, which takes a priority to common shareholders. Preferred equity interests generally have a stated dividend rate and may not have a fixed maturity date. 

Warrants and Equity Co-Investment Securities. In some cases, we may also receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection with a loan. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a &#147;put,&#148; or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In other cases, we may make a minority equity co-investment in the portfolio company in connection with a loan. 

We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 

&#149; selecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss; &#149; requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and &#149; negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board of directors under some circumstances. We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company. 

&#160;

&#160;

Investments We seek to create a diverse portfolio that includes senior secured, unitranche, junior secured loans and warrants and equity co-investment securities by investing approximately $2.0 million to $18.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. This investment size may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. Set forth below is a list of our ten largest portfolio company investments as of December 31, 2015, as well as the top ten industries in which we were invested as of December 31, 2015, in each case calculated as a percentage of our total investments at fair value as of such date (dollars in thousands):

INVESTMENT PROCESS OVERVIEW We view our investment process as consisting of four distinct phases described below: 

Origination. MC Advisors seeks to develop investment opportunities through extensive relationships with regional banks, private equity firms, financial intermediaries, management teams and other turn-around advisors. Monroe Capital has developed this network since its formation in 2004. MC Advisors manages these leads through personal visits and calls by its senior deal professionals. It is these professionals&#146; responsibility to identify specific opportunities, refine opportunities through due diligence regarding the underlying facts and circumstances and utilize innovative thinking and flexible terms to solve the financing issues of prospective clients. Monroe Capital&#146;s origination professionals are broadly dispersed throughout North America, with eight offices in the United States and one office in Canada. Certain of Monroe Capital&#146;s originators are responsible for covering a specified target market based on geography and others focus on specialized industry verticals. We believe MC Advisors&#146; origination professionals&#146; experience is vital to enable us to provide our borrowers with innovative financing solutions. We further believe that their strength and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets will generate numerous financing opportunities and enable us to be highly selective in 

&#160;

&#160;

our lending activities. In sourcing new transactions, MC Advisors seeks opportunities to work with borrowers domiciled in the United States and Canada and typically focuses on industries in which Monroe Capital has previous lending experience. 

Due Diligence. For each of our investments, MC Advisors prepares a comprehensive new business presentation, which summarizes the investment opportunity and its due diligence and risk analysis, all from the perspective of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats presented by the opportunity. This presentation assesses the borrower and its management, including products and services offered, market position, sales and marketing capabilities and distribution channels; key contracts, customers and suppliers, meetings with management and facility tours; background checks on key executives; customer calls; and an evaluation of exit strategies. MC Advisors&#146; presentation typically evaluates historical financial performance of the borrower and includes projections, including operating trends, an assessment of the quality of financial information, capitalization and liquidity measures and debt service capacity. The financial analysis also includes sensitivity analysis against management projections and an analysis of potential downside scenarios, particularly for cyclical businesses. MC Advisors seeks to also review the dynamics of the borrowers&#146; industry and assess the maturity, market size, competition, technology and regulatory issues confronted by the industry. Finally MC Advisors&#146; new business presentation includes all relevant third-party reports and assessments, including, as applicable, analyses of the quality of earnings of the prospective borrower, a review of the business by industry experts and third-party valuations. In general, these analyses and reviews are more likely to be completed in agented or club deals in which MC Advisors will have greater access to the borrower and its management team. MC Advisors also includes in this due diligence, if relevant, field exams, collateral appraisals and environmental reviews, as well as a review of comparable private and public transactions. 

Underwriting. MC Advisors uses the systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation developed in house by Monroe Capital with a particular focus on determining the value of a business in a downside scenario. In this process, the senior investment professionals at MC Advisors bring to bear extensive lending experience with emphasis on lessons learned from the past two credit cycles. We believe that the extensive credit and debt work-out experience of Monroe Capital&#146;s senior management enables us to anticipate problems and minimize risks. Monroe Capital&#146;s underwriting professionals work closely with its origination professionals to identify individual deal strengths, risks and any risk mitigants. MC Advisors preliminarily screens transactions based on cash flow, enterprise value and asset-based characteristics, and each of these measures is developed on a proprietary basis using thorough credit analysis focused on sustainability and predictability of cash flow to support enterprise value, barriers to entry, market position, competition, customer and supplier relationships, management strength, private equity sponsor track record and industry dynamics. For asset-based transactions, MC Advisors seeks to understand current and future collateral value, opening availability and ongoing liquidity. MC Advisors documents this analysis through a new business presentation thoroughly reviewed by at least one member of its investment committee prior to proposing a formal term sheet. We believe this early involvement of the investment committee ensures that our resources and those of third parties are deployed appropriately and efficiently during the investment process and lowers execution risk for our clients. With respect to transactions reviewed by MC Advisors, we expect that only approximately 10% of our sourced deals will reach the formal term sheet stage. 

Credit Approval/Investment Committee Review. MC Advisors employs a standardized, structured process developed by Monroe Capital when evaluating and underwriting new investments for our portfolio. MC Advisors&#146; investment committee considers its comprehensive new business presentation to approve or decline each investment. This committee includes Messrs. Koenig, Peck, Egan and VanDerMeid. The committee is committed to providing a prompt turnaround on investment decisions. Each meeting to approve an investment requires a quorum of at least three members of the investment committee, and each investment must receive unanimous approval by such members of the investment committee. 

&#160;

The following chart illustrates the stages of MC Advisors&#146; evaluation process: 

Evaluation Process 

Execution. We believe Monroe Capital has developed a strong reputation for closing deals as proposed, and we intend to continue this tradition. Through MC Advisors&#146; consistent approach to credit evaluation and underwriting, we seek to close deals as fast or faster than competitive financing providers while maintaining the discipline with respect to credit, pricing and structure necessary to ensure the ultimate success of the financing. Upon completion of final documentation, a loan will typically be funded upon the initialing of the new business presentation and closing memo by our appropriate senior officers and confirmation of the flow of funds and wire transfer mechanics. 

Monitoring. We benefit from the portfolio management system already in place at Monroe Capital. This monitoring includes meetings on at least a monthly basis between the responsible analyst and our portfolio company to discuss market activity and current events. MC Advisors&#146; portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. MC Advisors&#146; monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors&#146; analysts monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. MC Advisors also monitors our investment exposure daily using a proprietary trend analysis tool. When necessary, MC Advisors updates our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports. 

As part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the following categories, which we refer to as MC Advisors&#146; investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each 

&#160;

&#160;

investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our Board reviews and affirms such ratings. A definition of the rating system follows: 

&#160; Investment Performance Risk Rating &#160; Summary Description Grade 1 &#160; Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer&#146;s operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 &#160; Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 &#160; Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment&#146;s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 &#160; Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer&#146;s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). For grade 4 investments, we intend to increase monitoring of the issuer. Grade 5 &#160; Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full, and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we expect to recover. 

Our investment performance ratings do not constitute any ratings of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 

In the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate a loan grade 4 or grade 5, the applicable analyst, in consultation with a member of the investment committee, develops an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower&#146;s management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as required amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors forms a team or engages outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve its value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. Several of Monroe Capital&#146;s professionals are experienced in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.

MANAGEMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS MC Advisors is located at 311 South Wacker Drive, Suite 6400, Chicago, Illinois 60606. MC Advisors is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board and in accordance with the 1940 Act, MC Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, MC Advisors: 

&#149; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#149; assists us in determining what securities we purchase, retain or sell; &#149; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and &#149; executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make. MC Advisors&#146; services under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. 

Management and Incentive Fee Under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors and subject to the overall supervision of our Board, MC Advisors provides investment advisory services to us. For providing these services, MC Advisors receives a fee from us, consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of average invested assets (calculated as total assets excluding cash) and is payable quarterly in arrears. 

The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the preceding quarter subject to a total return requirement. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under our administration agreement between an affiliate of Monroe Capital and MC Advisors (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. MC Advisors is not under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued interest that we never actually receive. 

The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then-current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. Therefore, any 

&#160;

&#160;

ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2% hurdle described below, subject to the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, and (ii) (x) 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the &#147;cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations&#148; is the amount, if positive, of the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the then-current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If any distributions from portfolio companies are characterized as a return of capital, such returns of capital would affect the capital gains incentive fee to the extent a gain or loss is realized. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed &#147;hurdle rate&#148; of 2% per quarter (8% annually). If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for MC Advisors to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. 

We pay MC Advisors an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 

&#149; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2% (8% annually); &#149; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) as the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision. The catch-up is meant to provide MC Advisors with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and &#149; 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

&#160;

&#160;

The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and management agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to MC Advisors, we calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the amortized cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the amortized cost of such investment since our inception. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the amortized cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year equals 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years. 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation Alternative 1 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% Hurdle rate (1) = 2% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.6125% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.0% Hurdle rate (1) = 2% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.3625% 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to &#147;catch-up&#148;) (3) &#160;= 100% &#215; (2.3625% &#150; 2%) = 0.3625% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income-related portion of the incentive fee is 0.3625%. 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 3 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% Hurdle rate (1) = 2% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625% Incentive fee = 100% &#215; Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to &#147;catch-up&#148;) (3) Incentive fee = 100% &#215; &#147;catch-up&#148; + (20% &#215; (Pre-incentive fee net investment income &#150; 2.5%)) &#147;Catch-up&#148; = 2.5% &#150; 2% = 0.5% 

Incentive fee = (100% &#215; 0.5%) + (20% &#215; (2.8625% &#150; 2.5%)) = 0.5% + (20% &#215; 0.3625%) = 0.5% + 0.0725% = 0.5725% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.56%. 

(1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. (3) The &#147;catch-up&#148; provision is intended to provide our investment advisor with an incentive fee of 20% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation: Assumptions Hurdle rate (1) = 2% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9 million 

Alternative 1 Additional Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625% 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $8 million 

Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters. 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 2 Additional Assumptions Investment Income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625%. 20% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $10 million 

Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above. 

(1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 1.75% annualized management fee. Example 3: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee (*): Alternative 1: Assumptions Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#147;FMV&#148;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million 

Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million &#151; ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) 

Year 3: None &#151; $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 

Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 &#151; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2) 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#147;Investment C&#148;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million 

Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million 

Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million 

&#160;

&#160;

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee &#151; 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 

Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) &#160;&#151; $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2 

Year 4: None 

Year 5: None &#151; $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 (2) 

* The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example. (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if we were to be wound up on a date other than our fiscal year end of any year, we may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on the fiscal year end of such year. (2) As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by our investment advisor ($6.4 million) is effectively greater than $5 million (20% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($25 million)). Payment of Our Expenses All investment professionals of MC Advisors and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by MC Advisors and not by us.

The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement without penalty. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; We depend upon MC Advisors&#146; senior management for our future success, and upon its access to the investment professionals of Monroe Capital and its affiliates&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; MC Advisors can resign on 60 days&#146; notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.&#148; 

Indemnification The Investment Advisory and Management Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, MC Advisors and its affiliates&#146; respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders and employees are entitled to indemnification from us from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person&#146;s duties under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement. 

Administration Agreement Pursuant to an Administration Agreement, MC Management furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, MC Management performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. MC Management also assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, prints and disseminates reports to our stockholders and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, MC Management also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 

Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of MC Management&#146;s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our 

&#160;

&#160;

officers, including our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Administration Agreement will continue in effect from year to year with the approval of our Board. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party. 

MC Management may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that MC Management outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to MC Management. We reimburse MC Management for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of MC Management&#146;s overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Under the Administration Agreement, amounts payable quarterly for administrative expenses covered under the Administration Agreement to MC Management were limited to the greater of (i) 0.375% of our average assets for such quarter and (ii) $375,000 through December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $2.9 million, $2.9 million and $2.4 million in administrative expenses (included within professional fees, administrative service fees and general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations) under the Administration Agreement, respectively, of which $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, was related to MC Management overhead and salary allocation and paid directly to MC Management. 

Indemnification The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, MC Management and its and its affiliates&#146; respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders and employees are entitled to indemnification from us from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Administration Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person&#146;s duties under the Administration Agreement. 

License Agreement We have entered into a license agreement with Monroe Capital under which Monroe Capital has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#147;Monroe Capital.&#148; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the &#147;Monroe Capital&#148; name for so long as MC Advisors or one of its affiliates remains our investment advisor. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#147;Monroe Capital&#148; name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors is in effect. 

Staffing Agreement We do not have any internal employees. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior investment professionals of MC Advisors to achieve our investment objective. MC Advisors is an affiliate of Monroe Capital and depends upon access to the investment professionals and other resources of Monroe Capital and Monroe Capital&#146;s affiliates to fulfill its obligations to us under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement. MC Advisors also depends upon Monroe Capital to obtain access to deal flow generated by the professionals of Monroe Capital and its affiliates. Under the Staffing Agreement, MC Management provides MC Advisors with the resources necessary to fulfill these obligations. The Staffing Agreement provides that MC Management will make available to MC Advisors experienced investment professionals and access to the senior investment personnel of Monroe Capital for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of MC Advisors&#146; investment committee serve in such capacity. The Staffing Agreement remains in effect until terminated and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided to MC Advisors on a direct cost reimbursement basis, and such fees are not our obligation. 

&#160;

&#160;

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and Staffing Agreement At a meeting of our Board held on October 22, 2015, our Board unanimously voted to approve and continue the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and the specific individuals provided through the Staffing Agreement between MC Advisors and MC Management that comprise our investment committee. In reaching a decision to approve and continue the investment advisory agreement and investment committee, the Board reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 

&#149; the fee structures of and services provided by comparable externally managed business development companies that engage in similar investing activities; &#149; the Company&#146;s performance as compared to its peers; &#149; information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the investment advisory agreement and staffing agreement, including the specific approval of the members of the investment committee to be provided pursuant to the staffing agreement; &#149; the organizational capability and financial condition of Monroe Capital and its affiliates; and &#149; various other matters. Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, our Board, including all of the directors who are not &#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the investment advisory agreement and its continuation as being in the best interests of our stockholders. MC Advisors bears all expenses related to the services and personnel provided pursuant to the Staffing Agreement. 

VALUATION PROCESS AND DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. We calculate the value of our total assets in accordance with the following procedures. 

Investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date are valued at such market quotations. We may also obtain indicative prices with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We expect that there will not be a readily available market value within a recent date for many of our investments; those debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. 

Our Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which no indicative prices from pricing services or brokers or dealers have been received, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

&#149; the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; &#149; preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; &#149; our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct fair value appraisals of material investments for which market quotations are not readily available. These fair value appraisals for material investments are received at least once in every calendar year for each portfolio company investment, but are generally received quarterly; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; our audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments; and &#149; our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. The valuation technique utilized in the determination of fair value is affected by a wide variety of factors including the type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. Management generally uses the yield approach to determine fair value of debt investments, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in work-out status, management may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. The types of factors that may be taken into account in the determination of the fair value of our investments include, as relevant, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, overall market conditions, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally, comparisons to publicly traded securities, the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the portfolio company&#146;s financial performance and ability to make scheduled payments, the nature and net realizable value of any collateral and other relevant factors. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the determination of fair value. 

We report our investments at fair value with changes in value reported through our consolidated statements of operations under the caption &#147;unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.&#148; In determining fair value, we are required to assume that portfolio investments are to be sold in the principal market to market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. The market in which we can exit portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level activity is considered our principal market. 

Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 

COMPETITION We compete with a number of specialty and commercial finance companies to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies, including business development companies, traditional commercial banks, private investment funds, regional banking institutions, small business investment companies, investment banks and insurance companies. Additionally, with increased competition for investment opportunities, alternative investment vehicles such as hedge funds may invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in or from which they had withdrawn during the recent economic downturn, including investing in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investments in lower middle-market companies has intensified, and we expect that trend to continue. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. 

We use the expertise of the investment professionals of MC Advisors to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing and terms for investments in our loan portfolio. In addition, we expect that the relationships of the senior professionals of MC Advisors will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, investment opportunities with attractive middle-market companies, independently or in conjunction with the private equity clients of MC Advisors. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.&#148; 

&#160;

&#160;

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY We utilize a number of industry standard practices and software packages to secure, protect, manage and back up all corporate data. We outsource our information technology function to efficiently monitor and maintain our systems. Also, we conduct a daily backup of our systems to ensure the security and stability of the network. Our system provider performs this backup off site. 

ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A RIC As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). Generally we would expect these distributions to be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income and not to be eligible for the reduced maximum tax rates associated with qualified dividends. 

TAXATION AS A RIC If we continue to: 

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses we distribute to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (c) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding years (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recorded $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero within general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations for U.S. federal excise tax. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#149; meet the Annual Distribution Requirement; &#149; qualify to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income) (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#149; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148;); and &#149; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes (other than a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148;), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148;) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148;) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests. 

In order to prevent our receipt of income that would not satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may establish one or more special purpose corporations to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any investments held through a special purpose corporation would generally be subject to federal income taxes and other taxes, and therefore would be expected to achieve a reduced after-tax yield. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in our income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash. 

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we do not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level federal income tax. 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Our investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. Stockholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us. 

&#160;

&#160;

If we purchase shares in a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; (a &#147;PFIC&#148;), we may be subject to federal income tax on a portion of any &#147;excess distribution&#148; or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a &#147;qualified electing fund&#148; (a &#147;QEF&#148;), under the Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in that case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will be taken into account for purposes of the Annual Distribution Requirement and the 4% federal excise tax. 

Under Section 988 of the Code, gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses, or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities is generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss. 

If we use leverage, we may be subject to certain financial covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. If we are unable to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify as a RIC. 

Although we do not expect to do so, we will be authorized (subject to our financial covenants and 1940 Act asset coverage tests) to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to eliminate or minimize our liability for federal income tax and the 4% federal excise tax. However, our ability to dispose of assets to make distributions may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4% federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, and certain relief provisions are not available, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. See &#147;Failure To Qualify as a RIC&#148; below for more information. 

As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. We generally are permitted to carry forward for an indefinite period any capital losses not used to offset capital gains. However, future transactions that we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions. 

&#160;

&#160;

As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148; (as defined in the Code). If the partnership is a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#148; the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be &#147;securities&#148; for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the partnership, however, is not treated as a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#148; then the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income and assets of the partnership allocable to us. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and, therefore, could adversely affect our qualification as a RIC. We intend to monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC If we fail the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year or quarter of such taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions of the Code apply (which, among other things may require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets). If we are unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. In the event of such a failure to qualify, distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income (currently generally eligible for the 20% maximum rate in the case of U.S. individual stockholders) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for two or more taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next ten years. 

REGULATION We are a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisors), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a business development company be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#147;underwriter&#148; as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest, in the aggregate, 

&#160;

&#160;

more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies are fundamental and may be changed to the extent permitted by law without stockholder approval. 

The SBIC license allows our subsidiary, MRCC SBIC, to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis (pooling date) at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, has a superior claim to MRCC SBIC&#146;s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate MRCC SBIC or the SBA exercises its remedies upon an event of default. As of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had $20.0 million in regulatory and leveragable capital and $40.0 million in SBA guaranteed debentures outstanding. 

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25% of its investment activity to &#147;smaller&#148; concerns as defined by the SBA. A smaller concern is one that has a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $2.0 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depends on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. 

SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an individual SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a leverage commitment from the SBA and has been through an audit examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. The SBA also historically limited a related group of SBICs (commonly referred to as a &#147;family of funds&#148;) to a maximum of $225.0 million in total borrowings. On December 18, 2015, this family of funds limitation was raised to $350.0 million in total borrowings. As we have other affiliated SBICs already in operation, MRCC SBIC was historically limited to a maximum of $40.0 million in borrowings. Pursuant to the increase in the family of funds limitation, during February 2016 we submitted a commitment application to the SBA for $80.0 million in additional SBA-guaranteed debentures for MRCC SBIC. While there is no guarantee that the SBA will grant this request, we believe that MRCC SBIC is a good candidate to receive these additional debentures. If MRCC SBIC&#146;s commitment application is accepted by the SBA, in order for MRCC SBIC to gain access to the entirety of the $80.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures, we would be required to contribute to MRCC SBIC an additional $40.0 million in leveragable and regulatory capital. 

On October 2, 2014, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of MRCC SBIC guaranteed by the SBA from our 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow, through MRCC SBIC, more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a &#147;change of control&#148; or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, our current and any future SBIC subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to us if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations. 

MRCC SBIC is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of a SBIC license does not assure that MRCC SBIC will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon MRCC SBIC&#146;s 

&#160;

&#160;

continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to MRCC SBIC&#146;s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate MRCC SBIC or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued to MRCC SBIC upon an event of default. 

QUALIFYING ASSETS Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

(a) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: &#149; is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; &#149; is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and &#149; satisfies either of the following: &#149; does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250 million market capitalization maximum; or &#149; is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, and such business development company actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. (b) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. (c) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization, or, if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. (d) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity securities of the eligible portfolio company. (e) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. (f) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. To the extent we invest in the securities of companies domiciled in or with their principal places of business outside of the United States, these investments will not be qualifying assets. In accordance with Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, we cannot invest more than 30% of our assets in non-qualifying assets. 

&#160;

&#160;

MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES A business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (a), (b) or (c) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a business development company must either control the issuer of securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when a business development company purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers, employees or agents offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. MC Advisors or its affiliates provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. MC Advisors monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

SENIOR SECURITIES We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. 

CODES OF ETHICS We and MC Advisors have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#146;s requirements. You may access our code of ethics on our website at www.monroebdc.com. The date and substance of amendments to the code, if any, are noted on the cover page of the code of ethics. You may also read and copy the code of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to MC Advisors. The proxy voting policies and procedures of MC Advisors are set out below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by MC Advisors and our directors who are not &#147;interested persons,&#148; and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these proxy voting policies and procedures described below, &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; refer to MC Advisors. 

Introduction As an investment advisor registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients&#146; stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by our clients. In most cases we will vote in favor of proposals that we believe are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our clients&#146; portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions are made by those senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients&#146; investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, we will disclose such conflicts to our client, including those directors who are not interested persons and we may request guidance from such persons on how to vote such proxies for their account. 

Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information about how we voted proxies for Monroe Capital Corporation by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Monroe Capital Corporation, 311 South Wacker Drive, Suite 6400, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention: Investor Relations, or by calling Monroe Capital Corporation at (312) 258-8300. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains such information. 

COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We and our investment advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 

PRIVACY PRINCIPLES We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

&#160;

&#160;

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of MC Advisors and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 

OTHER We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to Monroe Capital Corporation or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

We and MC Advisors are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, obtain approval of the Board of these policies and procedures, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the business development company prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all &#147;joint transactions&#148; between entities that share a common investment advisor. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the advisor negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. As a result, we only expect to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other funds advised by MC Advisors when each of us will own the same securities of the issuer and when no term is negotiated other than price. Any such investment would be made in compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and for another fund advised by MC Advisors to invest in different securities of the same issuer, MC Advisors will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we are unable to invest in any issuer in which another fund advised by MC Advisors has previously invested. 

On October 15, 2014, we were granted an exemptive relief order that permits Monroe Capital Corporation, MC Advisors, MC Management, MRCC SBIC and other affiliates of Monroe Capital to engage in co-investment transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. Subject to certain conditions, we are now allowed to participate in negotiated investments with certain affiliated investment funds, providing our stockholders with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. 

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING CONFLICTS Affiliates of MC Advisors manage other assets in three closed-end funds, two small business investment companies and seven private funds that also have an investment strategy focused primarily on senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt to lower middle-market companies. In addition, MC Advisors manages our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiary, MRCC SBIC, as the manager of MRCC SBIC&#146;s general partner, and it may manage other entities in the future with an investment focus similar to ours. To the extent that we compete with entities managed by MC Advisors or any of its affiliates for a particular investment opportunity, MC Advisors will allocate investment opportunities across the entities for which such opportunities are appropriate, consistent with (a) its internal conflict of interest and allocation policies, (b) the requirements of the Advisers Act and (c) certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and rules thereunder regarding co-investments with affiliates. MC Advisors&#146; allocation policies are intended to ensure that we may generally share equitably with other investment funds or other investment vehicles managed by MC Advisors or its affiliates in investment opportunities, particularly those involving a security with limited supply or involving differing classes of securities of the same issuer which may be suitable for us and such other investment funds or other investment vehicles. 

&#160;

&#160;

MC Advisors and/or its affiliates may in the future sponsor or manage investment funds, accounts, or other investment vehicles with similar or overlapping investment strategies and have put in place a conflict-resolution policy that addresses the co-investment restrictions set forth under the 1940 Act. MC Advisors will seek to ensure an equitable allocation of investment opportunities when we are able to invest alongside other accounts managed by MC Advisors and its affiliates. We received exemptive relief from the SEC on October 15, 2014 that permits greater flexibility relating to co-investments, subject to certain conditions. When we invest alongside such other accounts as permitted under the 1940 Act, pursuant to SEC staff interpretation, and by our exemptive relief from the SEC that would permit greater flexibility relating to co-investments, such investments will be made consistent with such relief and MC Advisors&#146; allocation policy. Under this allocation policy, a fixed percentage of each opportunity, which may vary based on asset class and from time to time, will be offered to us and similar eligible accounts, as periodically determined by MC Advisors and approved by our Board, including a majority of our independent directors. The allocation policy provides that allocations among us and other accounts will generally be made pro rata based on each account&#146;s capital available for investment, as determined, in our case, by our Board, including a majority of our independent directors. It is our policy to base our determinations as to the amount of capital available for investment on such factors as the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, the targeted asset mix and diversification requirements and other investment policies and restrictions set by our Board, or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. We expect that these determinations will be made similarly for other accounts. In situations where co-investment with other entities sponsored or managed by MC Advisors or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, MC Advisors will need to decide whether we or such other entity or entities will proceed with the investment. MC Advisors will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures which will generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on a basis that is fair and equitable over time, including, for example, through random or rotational methods.
