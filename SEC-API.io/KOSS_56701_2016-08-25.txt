 ITEM 1. &#160; &#32; BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

As used herein unless the context otherwise requires, the term &#8220;Company&#8221; means Koss Corporation and its subsidiary, Koss U.K. Limited. The Company formed Koss U.K. Limited to comply with certain European Union ("EU") requirements. The entity is non-operating and holds no assets. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1971. 

&#160; 

The Company operates in the audio/video industry segment of the home entertainment industry through its design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessory products. The Company reports its results as a single reporting segment, as the Company&#8217;s principal business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold through national retailers, U.S. distributors, international distributors, audio specialty stores, the internet, direct mail catalogs, regional department store chains, discount department stores, grocery stores, electronics retailers, military exchanges and prisons under the &#8220;Koss&#8221; name. The Company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems, and directly to other manufacturers for inclusion with their own products. The Company has more than 200 &#32;domestic dealers and its products are carried in approximately 16,000 &#32;domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide. International markets are served by domestic sales representatives and sales offices in the Netherlands and Russia. The Company utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries. 

&#160; 

Approximately 83% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2016 &#32;sales were from stereo headphones used for listening to music. The remaining 17% &#32;of the Company's sales were from headphones used in communications, education settings, and in conjunction with metal detectors. The products are not significantly differentiated by their retail sales channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems and prisons. There are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself, which is highly subjective. 

The Company sources complete stereo headphones manufactured to its specifications from various manufacturers in Asia as well as raw materials used to produce stereo headphones at its plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Management believes that it has sources of complete stereo headphones and raw materials that are adequate for its needs. 

&#160; 

There are no employment or compensation commitments between the Company and its dealers. The Company has several independent manufacturers&#8217; representatives as part of its distribution efforts. The Company typically signs one year contracts with these manufacturers&#8217; representatives. The arrangements with foreign distributors do not contemplate that the Company pays any compensation other than any profit the distributors make upon their sale of the Company&#8217;s products. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

John C. Koss is recognized for creating the stereo headphone industry with the first SP/3 stereo headphone in 1958. The Company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world, and over the years the Company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia. The Company currently has 508 &#32;trademarks registered in 100 &#32;countries around the world and 171 &#32;patents in 26 &#32;countries. The Company has trademarks to protect the brand name, Koss, and its logo on its products. The Company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products. These trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the Company from its competitors. Certain of the Company&#8217;s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business. The Company considers protection of its proprietary developments important; however, the Company&#8217;s business is not, in the opinion of management, materially dependent upon any single trademark or patent. During the year ended June 30, 2016 , the Company took steps to update and monitor its patents and trademarks to protect its intellectual property around the world. 

&#160; 

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

Although retail sales of consumer electronics have typically been higher during the holiday season, stereo headphones have also seen increased purchases throughout the year. Management believes that the Company's business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that net sales for the last couple of years, including the year ended June 30, 2016 , were almost equally split between the first and second halves of the year. Management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers and distributors is related to the fact that consumers are increasingly purchasing stereo headphones throughout the year as replacements for older or lower quality headphones to improve the quality of their listening experience as it relates to portable electronic products. Therefore, upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereo headphones during the holiday season. 

&#160; 

WORKING CAPITAL AND BACKLOG 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers. From time to time, although rarely, the Company may extend payment terms to its customers for a special promotion. For instance, the Company has in the past offered a 90-120 day payment period for certain customers, such as computer retailers and office supply stores. Based on historical trends, management does not expect these practices to have a material effect on net sales or net income. The Company&#8217;s backlog of orders as of June 30, 2016 , is not significant in relation to net sales during fiscal year 2016 &#32;or projected fiscal year 2017 &#32;net sales. 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

The Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music, DVDs in vehicles, sound bytes on computer systems, and other audio related media. The Company distributes these products through retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world. The Company markets its products through approximately 16,000 &#32;domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide. During fiscal year 2016 , the Company&#8217;s sales to its largest single customer, Tura Scandinavia AB, were approximately 17% &#32;of net sales and sales to Wal-Mart accounted for 11% &#32;of net sales. In fiscal year 2015 , net sales to Tura Scandinavia AB and Wal-Mart accounted for 15% &#32;and 8% &#32;of net sales, respectively. The Company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the Company&#8217;s line of products. Loss of retailers and distributors means loss of product placement. The Company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores, mass merchants, and electronics stores. Management believes that any loss of revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease, on a percentage basis, in expenses, thereby partially reducing the impact on the Company&#8217;s income from operations. The five largest customers of the Company (including Tura Scandinavia AB and Wal-Mart) accounted for approximately 47% &#32;and 45% &#32;of net sales in fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The Company focuses on the stereo headphone industry. In the stereo headphone market, the Company competes directly with approximately six major competitors, several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the Company. The extent to which retailers and consumers view the Company as an innovative vendor of high quality stereo headphone products, and a provider of excellent after sales customer service, is the extent to which the Company maintains a competitive advantage. The Company relies upon its unique sound, quality workmanship, brand identification, engineering skills, and customer service to maintain its competitive position. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

The amount expensed on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was $91,259 &#32;during fiscal year 2016 . These activities were conducted by both Company personnel and outside consultants. There were no expenses for research and development activities during fiscal year 2015 . The Company expects to incur research and development costs related to its Bluetooth&#174; and traditional wired headphones during fiscal year 2017 &#32;as it is planning to introduce several new product offerings. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject. During the fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 , the amounts incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or financial condition. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016 , the Company employed 54 &#32;non-union employees, 6 &#32;of which were part-time employees. The Company also engaged temporary personnel at times during the year ended June 30, 2016 . 

&#160; 

FOREIGN SALES 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s competitive position and risks relating to its business in foreign markets are comparable to those in the domestic market. In addition, the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers on imports. The creation of additional barriers would reduce the Company&#8217;s net sales and net income. In addition, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the Company&#8217;s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lower-priced, less profitable products, and could affect overall demand for the Company&#8217;s products. For further information, see Part II, Item 7 and Note 16 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The Company has small sales offices in the Netherlands and Russia to service the international export marketplace. The Company is not aware of any material risks in maintaining these offices. Loss of these offices would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility. The Company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the United States including Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico. During the last two fiscal years, net sales of all Koss products were distributed as follows:

&#160; 

The Company has a manufacturing facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. Since these independent suppliers are not located in the United States, the Company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters, war, disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically. The Company maintains finished goods inventory in its U.S. facility to mitigate this risk. The Company&#8217;s goal is to stock finished goods inventory at an average of approximately 90 days demand per item. Recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take 120 days. The Company believes that it could restore production of its top ten selling models (which represent approximately 61% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s 2016 &#32;net sales) within one year. The Company is also at risk if trade restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the Company&#8217;s customers, which would directly affect profits.
