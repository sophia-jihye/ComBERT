&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

We are a national solutions provider of a wide range of information technology, or IT, solutions. We help our customers design, enable, manage, and service their IT environments. We provide IT products, including computer systems, software and peripheral equipment, networking communications, and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers. We also offer services involving design, configuration, and implementation of IT solutions. These services are performed by our personnel and by third-party providers. We have three &#160; operating segments, which serve primarily: (a) small- to medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, in our SMB segment, through our PC Connection Sales subsidiary, (b) large enterprise customers, in our Large Account segment , through our MoreDirect subsidiar y , and (c) federal, state, and local government and educational institutions, in our Public Sector segment , through our GovConnection subsidiary. We generate sales through (i) outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by sales representatives focused on the business, education al , healthcare, and government markets, (ii) our w ebsites , and (iii) inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media. &#160; &#160; We offer a broad selection of over 3 0 0 ,000 products at competitive prices, including products from Apple, Cisco Systems, Dell, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, &#160; Symantec , and VMWare, and we partner with more than &#160; 1,600 supplier s . Our most frequently ordered products are carried in inventory &#160; and are typically shipped to customers the same day the order is received . 

&#160; 

Since our founding in 1982, we have consistently served our customers&#8217; needs by providing innovative, reliable, and timely service and technical support, and by offering an extensive assortment of branded products through knowledgeable, well-trained sales and support teams. &#160; Our strategy&#8217;s effectiveness is reflected in the recognition we have received, including being named to the Fortune 1000 and &#160; the CRN Solution Provider 500 &#160; for f ifteen straight years . Over the past few years , we have received numerous awards, including the Microsoft Operational Excellence Award for delivering market-leading operational excellence , as well as being recently named Symantec National Reseller Growth Partner of the Year. We believe that our ability to understand our customers&#8217; needs and provide comprehensive and effective IT solutions has resulted in strong brand name recognition and a broad and loyal customer base. We also believe that through our strong vendor relationships we can provide an efficient supply chain and be an effective IT solution provider for our multiple customer segments. 

&#160; 

W e strive to identif y the unique needs of our corporate , government , &#160; healthcare, educational , and small business cu s tomer s, and have designed our business processes to enable our customers to effectively manage &#160; their IT systems. We provide value by offering &#160; our customers efficient design, deployment, and infrastructure management of IT environments . As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 7 3 0 &#160; s ales representatives , whose average tenure exceeded six &#160; years . &#160; Sales representatives are responsible for managing corporate and public sector accounts and focus on sales to current and prospective customers. &#160; &#160; These sales representatives are supported by a n increasing number of support, engineering , and technical staff . We believe that i ncreasing our sales force productivity is important to our future success , and we have increased our headcount and investments in this area accordingly. 

&#160; 

We market our products and services through our websites: www.pcconnection.com, www.moredirect.com , www.govconnection.com , &#160; and www.macconnection.com . Our websites provide extensive product information , customized pricing, and the convenience of &#160; online orders. 

&#160; 

We also publish several catalogs, including PC Connection &#174; , focusing on PCs and compatible products , &#160; and MacConnection &#174; , focusing on Apple personal computers and compatible products. We also issue, from time to time, specialty catalogs, including GovConnection catalogs directed to government and educational institutions and Connection Magazine, directed to mid-market, enterprise , and healthcare customers . &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Additional financial information regarding our business segments and geographic data about our customers and assets is contained in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

MARKET AND COMPETITION 

&#160; 

In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, w e generate d approximately 4 1 % of our sales from the SMB segment , 3 7 % from medium-to-large corporate accounts (Fortune 1000) , and 2 2 % from government and education al &#160; institutions . &#160; &#160; T he overall IT market that we serve is estimated &#160; to be approximately &#160; $ 200 &#160; billion . 

&#160; 

The largest segment of this market is served by local and regional &#8220;value added resellers,&#8221; or VARs, many of whom we believe are transitioning from the hardware and software products business to higher margin IT services . We have transitioned from an end-user or desktop-centric computing supplier to a network or enterprise-wide IT solutions &#160; supplier. &#160; &#160; We have also partnered with third-party technology and telecommunications service providers. We now offer our customers access to the same services and technical expertise as local and regional VARs, but with a more extensive product selection at generally lower prices. 

&#160; 

Intense competition for customers has led manufacturers of our IT products to use all available channels, including direct marketers, to distribute their products. &#160; &#160; C ertain of these manufacturers who have traditionally used resellers to distribute their products have , from time to time, established their own direct marketing operations, including sales through the I nternet . &#160; Nonetheless , we believe that these manufacturers &#160; will continue to provide us and other third-party direct marketers favorable product allocations and marketing support. 

&#160; 

We believe new entrants to the direct marketing channel must overcome a number of obstacles, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the substantial time and resources required to build a customer base of meaningful size and profitability for cost-effective &#160; operation ; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the high costs of developing the information systems and operating infrastructure required to successfully compete as a direct marketer; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the advantages enjoyed by larger and more established competitors in terms of purchasing and operating efficiencies; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the difficulty of building relationships with vendors to achieve favorable product allocations and attractive pricing terms; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the difficulty of identifying and recruiting management personnel with significant direct marketing experience in the industry. 

&#160; 

&#160;

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

&#160; 

We believe we become our customers&#8217; IT provider of choice by providing innovative IT solutions which meet their needs of increased productivity, mobility, virtualization, and security in a continually evolving IT environment. We provide enhanced value by assisting them in cost-effectively maximizing business opportunities provided by new technologies and advanced service solutions. The key elements of our business strategies include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Providing consistent customer service before, during, and after the sale . We believe that we have earned a reputation for providing superior customer service by consistently focusing on our customers&#8217; needs . We have dedicated our resources to developing strong, long-term relationships with our customers by accurately assessing their IT needs, and providing scalable, high-quality solutions and services through our knowledgeable, well-trained personnel. Through operational excellence, we have efficient delivery programs that provide a quality buying experience for our customers with reasonable return policies. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Offering a broad product selection at competitive prices . We offer a broad range of IT products and solutions, including personal computers and related peripheral products, servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, at costs that allow our customers to be more productive while maximizing their IT budgets. Our advanced solution offerings include network, server, storage, and mission-critical onsite installation and support using proprietary cloud-based service management software. We offer products and enhanced service capabilities with aggressive price and performance standards, all with the convenience of one-stop shopping for technology solutions. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Simplifying technology product procurement for corporate customers. We offer Internet-based procurement &#160; options to eliminate complexity and enhance customer value , as well as lower the cost of procurement for our customers. Our Large Account segment specializes in Internet-based solutions and provides electronic integration between its customers and suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Offering targeted IT solutions . Our customers seek solutions to increasingly complex IT infrastructure demands. To better address their business needs, we have focused our solution service capabilities on s ix &#160; practice areas&#8212; Converged Data Center, Networking, Mobility, S ecurity , Cloud Solutions , and Software. These IT practice groups are responsible for understanding the infrastructure needs of our customers, and for designing cost-effective technology solutions to address them. We have also partnered with third-party providers to make available a range of IT support services, including asset assessment, implementation, maintenance, and disposal services. We believe we can leverage these s ix &#160; practice groups to transform our company into a recognized IT solution provider, which will enable us to capture a greater share of the IT expenditures of our customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maintaining a strong brand name and customer awareness. Since our founding in 1982, we have built a strong brand name and customer awareness. We have been named to the Fortune 1000 and the CRN Solution Provider 500 for each of the last f ifteen &#160; years . We actively work with our existing customers to become their IT provider of choice for products and enhanced solution services, while seeking to ensur e our reputation of high-quality customer service, tailored marketing programs, and competitive pricing lead the way to expanding our share of the overall IT market. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maintaining long-standing vendor relationships . We have a history of strong relationships with vendors, and were among the first national solutions provider s qualified by manufacturers to market computer systems to end users . By working closely with our vendors to provide an efficient channel for the advertising and distribution of their products, we expect to expand market share and generate opportunities for optimizing partner incentive programs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

GROWTH STRATEGIES 

&#160; 

Our growth strategies are designed to increase revenues by &#160; maximiz ing operational efficiencies &#160; while offering innovative &#160; product s and value added service offerings, increas ing penetration of our existing customers, and expand ing our customer base. Our six key elements of growth &#160; are : 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expanding hardware and software offerings. We offer our customers an extensive range of IT hardware and software products , and in response to customer demand , we continually evaluate and add new products as they become available. We work closely with vendors to identify and source first-to-market product offerings at aggressive prices. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expanding IT solution services offerings. We strive to accelerate solution and service growth by providing creative solutions to the increasingly complex hardware and software needs of our customers. Our Lifecycle, Data Center, Networking, Mobility, Storage, Cloud Solutions , and Software services practice groups &#160; consist of industry-certified and product-certified engineers, as well as highly specialized third-party providers. Our investment in these s ix &#160; practice areas is expected to increase our share of our customer s &#8217; annual IT expenditures by broadening the range of products and services they purchase from us. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Targeting customer segments. Through increased targeted marketing, we seek to expand the number of our active customers and generate additional sales to existing customers by providing more value-added services and solutions. We have developed specialty catalogs featuring product offerings designed to address the needs of specific customer populations, including new product inserts targeted to purchasers of graphics, server, and networking products. We also utilize I nternet marketing campaigns that focus on select markets , such as healthcare . 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Increasing productivity of our sales representatives . We believe that higher sales productivity is the key to leveraging our expense structure and driving future profitability improvements. We invest significant resources in training new sales representatives and provid ing ongoing training to experienced personnel. Our training and evaluation programs are focused towards assisting our sales personnel in understanding and anticipating clients&#8217; IT needs, with the goal of fostering loyal customer relationships. We also provide our sales representatives with technical support on more complex sales opportunities through our expanding group of technical solution specialist s. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Migrating to cloud-based solutions for our customers. Cloud computing will be a key driver of new IT spending as our customers seek scalable, cost-effective solutions. We plan to expand our cloud-based solution sales and assist our customers in navigating the complex and growing field of cloud-solution offerings. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances. We seek acquisitions and alliances that add new customers, strengthen our product offerings, add management talent, and produce operating results which are accretive to our core business earnings. 

&#160; 

SERVICE AND SUPPORT 

&#160; 

Since our founding in 1982, our primary objective has been to provide products and services that meet the demands and needs of customers and to supplement those products with up-to-date product information and excellent customer service and support. We believe that offering our customers superior value, through a combination of product knowledge, consistent and reliable service and support , and leading products at competitive prices, differentiates us from other direct marketers and provides the foundation for developing a broad and loyal customer base. 

&#160; 

We invest in training programs for our service and support personnel, with an emphasis on putting customer needs and service first. Product support technicians assist callers with questions concerning compatibility, installation, and more difficult questions relating to product use. The product support technicians authorize customers to return defective or incompatible products to either the manufacturer or to us for warranty service. In-house technicians perform both warranty and non-warranty repair on most major systems and hardware products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Using our customized information system, we transmit our customer orders either to our distribution center or to our drop &#8209;ship suppliers, depending on product availability, for processing immediately after a customer receives credit approval. At our distribution center, we also perform custom configuration of computer systems as requested by our customers, which typically consists of the installation of memory, accessories, and/or software purchased. Our customers may select the method of delivery that best meets their needs and is most cost &#160; effective , ranging from expedited overnight delivery for urgently needed items to ground freight, generally used for heavier, more bulky items. Through our Everything Overnight &#61650; service, orders accepted up to 7 : 00 p .m. Eastern Time can be shipped for overnight delivery &#160; from our distribution center . 

&#160; 

&#160; Our inventory stocking levels are based on three primary criteria. First, we stock and maintain a large quantity of products that sell through quickly (such as notebook and desktop systems, printers , and monitors). Second, we stock products obtained through opportunistic purchases (including first &#8209;to &#8209;market and end &#8209;of &#8209;life special promotions, and popular products with limited availability). Third, we stock products in common demand, such as components we use to configure systems prior to shipping, for which we want to avoid shortages. Inventory stocking decisions are made generally independent of the level of shipping service, as expedited shipping, including overnight delivery, is available through the majority of our drop &#8209;ship suppliers as well as through our warehouse. 

&#160; 

MARKETING AND SALES 

&#160; 

We sell our products through our direct marketing channels to (i) SMB s including &#160; small office/home office customers, (ii) &#160; government and educational institutions , and (iii) medium-to-large corporate accounts. &#160; We strive to be the primary supplier of IT products and solutions to our existing and prospective customers by providing exemplary customer service. &#160; &#160; We use multiple marketing approaches to reach existing and prospective customers, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

outbound telemarketing and field sales; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

digital, web , &#160; and print media advertising; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

marketing programs targeted t o specific customer populations . 

&#160; 

All of our marketing approaches emphasize our broad product offerings, fast delivery, customer support, competitive pricing, and our &#160; wide range of service solutions . 

&#160; 

Sales Channels . We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships and to encourage repeat purchases is largely dependent on the strength of our sales personnel and programs. Because our customers&#8217; primary contact with us is through our sales representatives, we are committed to maintaining a qualified, knowledgeable, and motivated sales staff with its principal focus on customer service. 

&#160; 

Outbound Telemarketing and Field Sales . We seek to build loyal relationships with potential high-volume customers by assigning them to individual account managers. We believe that customers respond favorably to one-on-one relationship s with personalized, well-trained account managers. Once established, these one-on-one relationships are maintained and enhanced through frequent telecommunications and targeted catalogs and e-mails, as well as other marketing materials designed to meet each customer&#8217;s specific IT needs. We pay most of our account managers a base annual salary plus incentive compensation. Incentive compensation is tied to gross profit dollars produced by the individual account manager. Account managers historically have significantly increased productivity after approximately twelve months of training and experience. 

&#160; 

Internet Sales . ( www.pcconnection.com, www.moredirect.com , www.govconnection.com, &#160; and &#160; www.macconnection.com ) We provide product descriptions and prices for generally all products online. Our PC Connection website also provides updated information for more than 3 0 0,000 items . We offer, and continuously update, selected product offerings and other special buys. We believe our websites &#160; are &#160; important sales source s and communication tool s for improving customer service. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our MoreDirect subsidiary&#8217;s business process and operations are primarily Web - based. Most of its corporate customers utilize a customized Web page to quickly search, source, and track IT products. MoreDirect&#8217;s w ebsite aggregates the current available inventories of its largest IT suppliers into a single online source for its corporate customers. Its custom designed Internet-based system, TRAXX &#8482; , provides corporate buyers with comparative pricing from several suppliers as well as special pricing arranged through the manufacturer. 

&#160; 

The Internet supports three key business initiatives for us: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Customer choice &#8212; We have built our business on the premise that our customers should be able to choose how they interact with us -- be it by telephone, or by means of their desktop or mobile device via email or the Internet. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Lowering transactions costs &#8212; Our website tools include robust product search features and Internet Business Accounts (customized Web pages), which allow customers to quickly and easily find information about products of interest to them. If customers still have questions, they may call our t elesales r epresentatives or a ccount m anagers. Such phone calls are typically shorter and have higher close rates than calls from customers who have not first visited our websites. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leveraging the time of experienced sales representatives &#8212; Our investments in technology-based sales and service programs allow our sales representatives more time to build and maintain relationships with our customers and help them to solve their business problems. 

&#160; 

Inbound Telesales . Our inbound sales representatives answer customer telephone calls generated by our catalogs and other advertising programs. They assist customers in making purchasing decisions, process product orders, and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing, and availability. Using our proprietary information systems, sales representatives can quickly access existing customer records which detail purchase history and billing and shipping information which helps expedite the ordering process. 

&#160; 

Business Segments . &#160; &#160; We conduct our business operations through three busi ness segments: SMB , &#160; Large Account , &#160; and Public Sector . 

&#160; 

SMB Segment . Our principal target market s in this segment are small-to-medium-sized business customers. We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers . 

&#160; 

Large Account Segment . Through our MoreDirect subsidiary&#8217;s custom designed Web-based system, we are able to offer our larger corporate customers an efficient and effective method of sourcing, evaluating, purchasing, and tracking a wide variety of IT products and services. MoreDirect&#8217;s strategy is to be the primary single source procurement portal for its large corporate customers. MoreDirect&#8217;s sales representatives typically have ten to twenty years of experience and are located strategically across the United States. This allows them to work directly with customers, often on site. MoreDirect generally places its product orders with manufacturers and/or distribution companies for drop shipment directly to its customers. &#160; 

&#160; 

Public Sector Segment . We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers. Through our GovConnection subsidiary, we target each of the four distinct market sectors within this segment&#8212;federal government, higher educational institutions, school grades K-12, and state and local governments. 

&#160;

Catalog Distribution. We publish a variety of catalogs including PC Connection &#174; for the PC market and MacConnection &#174; for the Apple market and distribute these catalogs to purchasers on our in-house mailing list as well as to prospective customers. In addition, we distribute specialty catalogs to educational and government customers and prospects on a periodic basis. We also publish monthly catalogs customized with special covers and inserts, offering a wide assortment of special offers on products in specific areas such as graphics, server/netcom, and mobile computing, or for specific customers, such as healthcare providers . 

&#160; 

Specialty Marketing. &#160; Our specialty marketing activities include direct mail and print campaigns, email programs, website promotions, and video/multimedia presentations. &#160; 

&#160; 

Customers. We maintain an extensive database of customers and prospects currently aggregating approximately &#160; 1 2 million names. However, n o single customer accounted for more than 2 % of our consolidated revenue in 2015 . While no single agency of the federal government comprised more than 2% of total sales, aggregate sales to the federal government were 6. 7 % , 6. 5 % , and 6 .4% in 2015 , &#160; 2014 , and &#160; 2013 , respectively . The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any of our business segments. In addition, we do not have individual orders in our backlog that are material to our business , as w e typically ship products within hours of receipt of orders . 

&#160; 

PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISING 

&#160; 

We continuously focus on expanding the breadth of our product offerings. We currently offer our customers over 3 00 ,000 information technology products designed for business applications from more than 1,600 vendors , including hardware and peripherals, accessories, networking products, and software. We select the products we sell based upon their technology and effectiveness, market demand, product features, quality, price, margins, and warranties. The following table sets forth our percentage of net sales (in dollars) for major product categories:

We offer a 30-day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise. Returns of non-defective products are subject to restocking fees. Substantially all of the products marketed by us are warranted by the manufacturer. We generally accept returns directly from the customer and then either credit the customer&#8217;s account or ship the customer a replacement or similar product from our inventory. 

&#160; 

&#160;

PURCHASING AND VENDOR RELATIONS 

&#160; 

P roduct purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., or Ingram, our largest supplier , accounted for approximately 2 1 %, 2 5 %, and 2 4 % of our total product purchases in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively . Purchases from Synnex Corporation , or Synnex, comprised 1 5 % , 1 3 % , and 1 2 % of our total product purchases in 2015 , 2014 , and &#160; 2013 , respectively. Purchases from Tech Data Corporation , or Tech Data, &#160; comprised 8 % of our total product purchases in 2015 and &#160; 2014 , respectively, and 10% in &#160; 2013 . No other vendor supplied more than 10% of our total product purchases in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 . We believe that, while we may experience some short-term disruption, alternative sources for products obtained directly from Ingram, Synnex, and Tech Data &#160; are available to us. 

&#160; 

Products manufactured by HP represented 2 2 % of our net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 2 5 % in 201 3 . We believe that in the event we experience either a short-term or permanent disruption of supply of HP products, such disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Many product suppliers reimburse us for advertisements or other cooperative marketing programs in our catalogs and other marketing vehicles . Reimbursements may be in the form of discounts, advertising allowances, and/or rebates. We also receive allowances from certain vendors based upon the volume of our purchases or sales of the vendors&#8217; products by us. &#160; Some of our vendors offer limited price protection in the form of rebates or credits against future purchases. We may also participate in end-of-life product and other special purchases which may not be eligible for price protection. 

&#160; 

We believe that we have excellent relationships with our vendors. We generally pay vendors within stated terms , or earlier when favorable cash discounts are offered . We believe our &#160; high volume of purchases enables &#160; us to obtain product pricing and terms that are competitive with those available to other major national solutions provider s. Although brand names and individual product offerings are important to our business, we believe that competitive products are available in substantially all of the merchandise categories offered by us. 

&#160; 

DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

We fulfill orders from customers both from products we hold in inventory and through drop shipping arrangements with manufacturers and distributors. At our 2 83 ,000 square foot distribution and fulfillment complex in Wilmington, Ohio , we receive and ship inventory, configure computer systems, and process returned products. Orders are transmitted electronically from our various sales facilities to our Wilmington distribution center after credit approval, where pack ag ing documentation is printed automatically and order fulfillment takes place . Our customers are given several shipping options, ranging from expedited overnight delivery through our Everything Overnight &#61650; service to normal ground freight service. T hrough our Everything Overnight &#174; service, orders accepted up until 7:00 p .m. Eastern T ime, can be shipped from our distribution center for overnight delivery via United Parcel Service , &#160; or UP S, &#160; or FedEx Corporation . &#160; &#160; Upon request, orders may also be shipped by other common carriers. 

&#160; 

We also place product orders directly with manufacturers and/or distribution companies for drop shipment directly to our customers. Our MoreDirect subsidiary generally utilizes drop shipping for substantially all product orders. Order status with distributors is tracked online, and in all circumstances, a confirmation of shipment from manufacturers and/or distribution companies is received prior to initial recording of the transaction. At the end of each financial reporting period, revenue is adjusted to reflect the anticipated receipt of products by the customers in the period. Products drop shipped by suppliers were 7 4 %, &#160; 7 3 %, and 71 % of net sales in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. In future years, we expect that products drop shipped from suppliers may increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as we seek to lower our overall inventory and distribution costs while maintaining excellent customer service. 

&#160; 

Certain of our larger customers occasionally request special staged delivery arrangements under which either we or our distribution partners set aside and temporarily hold inventory on our customer&#8217;s behalf. Such orders are firm delivery orders, and customers generally pay under normal credit terms, regardless of delivery. Revenue on such transactions is not recorded until shipment to their final destination as requested by the customer. Inventory held for such staged delivery requests aggregated $ 2 7.7 million and $ 1 9.8 million at December 31, 2015 &#160; and 2014 , respectively . 

&#160; 

&#160;

We maintain inventories of fast moving products that account for a high percentage of our ongoing product sales transactions and sales dollars. We may also, from time to time, make large inventory purchases of certain first &#8209;to &#8209;market products or end &#8209;of &#8209;life products to obtain favorable purchasing discounts. We also maintain sufficient inventory levels of high volume components and accessories used for configuration services . 

&#160; 

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

&#160; 

O ur subsidiaries &#160; utilize management information systems which have been significantly customized for our use . These systems permit centralized management of key functions, including order taking and processing, inventory and accounts receivable management, purchasing, sales, and distribution, and the preparation of daily operating control reports on key aspects of the business. We also operate advanced telecommunications equipment to support our sales and customer service operations. Key elements of the telecommunications systems are integrated with our computer systems to provide timely customer information to sales and service representatives, and to facilitate the preparation of operating and performance data. 

&#160; 

MoreDirect has developed a custom designed Internet-based system, TRAXX&#8482;. This system is an integrated application of sales order processing, integrated supply chain visibility, and has full E lectronic D ata I nterchange (EDI) links with major manufacturers &#8217; distribution partners for product information, availability, pricing, ordering, delivery, and tracking, including related accounting functions. 

&#160; 

Our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems, including our telephone systems, to manage our inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell, and ship our products efficiently and on a timely basis, and to maintain cost-efficient operations. We expect to continue upgrading our information systems in the future to more effectively manage our operations and customer database. 

&#160; 

Our investments in IT infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently. While we have not yet finalized our decisions regarding the areas of future investment in our IT infrastructure , we expect to increase our capital investments in our IT infrastructure , which if fully implemented, would likely exceed $20 million over the next two to f our years .

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The direct marketing and sale of IT related products, is highly competitive. We compete with other national solutions provider s of IT products, including CDW Co rporation and Insight Enterprises, Inc ., who are much larger than we are . We also compete with: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

certain product manufacturers that sell directly to customers &#160; as well as some of our own suppliers, such as &#160; Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo ; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

distributors that sell directly to certain customers; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

local and regional VARs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

various franchisers, office supply superstores, and national computer retailers; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

companies with more extensive w ebsites and commercial online networks. 

&#160; 

Additional competition may arise if other new met hods of distribution emerge in the future. &#160; &#160; We compete not only for customers, but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from product manufacturers. Several of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources. These and other factors &#160; related to our competitive position are discussed more fully in the &#8220;Overview&#8221; of Item 7 , &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe that price, product selection and availability, and service and support are the most important competitive factors in our industry.
