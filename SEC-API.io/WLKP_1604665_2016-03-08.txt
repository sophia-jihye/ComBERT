Description of Business 

Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Chemical Partners LP" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed in March 2014 to operate, acquire and develop facilities and related assets for the processing of natural gas liquids. On August 4, 2014, the Partnership completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of 12,937,500 &#32;common units representing limited partner interests. In connection with the IPO, the Partnership acquired a 10.6% &#32;interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo") and a 100% &#32;interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo GP LLC ("OpCo GP"), which is the general partner of OpCo. On April 29, 2015, the Partnership purchased an additional 2.7% &#32;newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo for approximately $135,341 , resulting in an aggregate 13.3% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo effective April 1, 2015. OpCo owns three &#32;natural gas liquids processing facilities and a common carrier ethylene pipeline (collectively, the "Contributed Assets"). 

References in these financial statements to the Partnership, OpCo and OpCo GP used in the present tense or prospectively refer to the period subsequent to the IPO. References in these financial statements to the "Predecessor" refer to Westlake Chemical Partners LP Predecessor, the Partnership's predecessor for accounting purposes and refer to the time periods prior to the IPO. References to "Westlake" refer collectively to Westlake Chemical Corporation and its subsidiaries, other than the Partnership, OpCo and OpCo GP. 

In connection with the IPO, OpCo and Westlake entered into an ethylene sales agreement (the "Ethylene Sales Agreement") pursuant to which the Partnership generates a substantial majority of its revenue. For more information, see Note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 

The Partnership sells ethylene production in excess of volumes sold to Westlake, as well as all of the co-products resulting from the ethylene production, including propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen, directly to third parties on either a spot or contract basis. Co-products sold to third parties continue to be transported by rail or truck. Net proceeds (after transportation and other costs) from the sales of ethylene co-products that result from the production of ethylene purchased by Westlake are netted against the ethylene price charged to Westlake under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, thereby reducing the Partnership's exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of these co-products. 

The Partnership's operations consist of activities relating solely to the Contributed Assets. The Predecessor's operations consisted of the entire ethylene business of Westlake, including the activities of the Contributed Assets, as well as activities which were retained by Westlake. Ethylene business activities retained by Westlake include, but are not limited to, procuring feedstock, managing inventory and commodity risk and transporting ethylene from manufacturing facilities. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The Partnership holds a 13.3% &#32;limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest in OpCo. The remaining 86.7% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo is owned directly by Westlake, which has no rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of OpCo. As a result of the fact that substantially all of OpCo's activities are conducted on behalf of Westlake, and the fact that OpCo exhibits disproportionality of voting rights to economic interest, OpCo was deemed to be a variable interest entity. The Partnership, through its ownership of OpCo's general partner, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of OpCo, and it also has the obligation or right to absorb losses or receive benefits from OpCo that could potentially be significant to OpCo. As such, the Partnership was determined to be OpCo's primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates OpCo's results of operations and financial position. Westlake's retained interest of 86.7% &#32;is recorded as noncontrolling interest in the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 

All financial information presented for the periods after the IPO represents the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Partnership. Financial information for the periods prior to the IPO represents the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Predecessor. The consolidated and combined financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were prepared as follows:

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

&#8226; 

The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 consists of the consolidated results of the Partnership for the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and the combined results of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2014 through August 3, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

&#8226; 

The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 consists of the consolidated results of the Partnership for the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and the combined results of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2014 through August 3, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

&#8226; 

The consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2014 consists of the combined activity for the Predecessor prior to August 4, 2014, and the consolidated activity for the Partnership at and subsequent to the IPO on August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014. The combined statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2013 consists entirely of the combined activity of the Predecessor. 

The combined statements of operations for the periods before August 4, 2014 include expense allocations for certain functions historically performed by Westlake and allocated to the ethylene business, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to finance, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, ethics and compliance, shared services, employee benefits and incentives and stock-based compensation. These allocations were based primarily on direct usage, when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of fixed assets, headcount or other measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements, including the assumptions regarding the allocation of expenses from Westlake, are reasonable and reflect all costs related to the operations of the Predecessor, including those incurred by Westlake on behalf of the Predecessor. Nevertheless, the combined financial statements may not include all of the expenses that would have been incurred had the Predecessor been a stand-alone company during the periods presented and may not reflect its results of operations, financial position and cash flows had the Predecessor been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimation of the amount of accounts receivable that the Partnership believes are unlikely to be collected. Estimating this amount requires analysis of the financial strength of the Partnership's customers, the use of historical experience, the Partnership's accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly. Past due balances over 90 &#32;days and high risk accounts, as determined by the analysis of financial strength of customers, are reviewed individually for collectibility. 

Inventories 

Inventories primarily include product, material and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") or average method. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures for improvements and betterments that extend the useful lives of the assets and interest capitalized on significant capital projects. 

Interest expense is capitalized for qualifying assets under construction. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Capitalized interest was $5,116 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and $2,638 &#32;for the period from August 4, 2014 &#32;to December 31, 2014 . Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Gains and losses on the disposal or retirement of property, plant and equipment are reflected in the statement of operations when the assets are sold or retired. 

The accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations requires the recording of liabilities equal to the fair value of asset retirement obligations and corresponding additional asset costs, when there is a legal asset retirement obligation as a result of existing or enacted law, statute or contract. The Partnership has conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of the Partnership's manufacturing facilities. However, no asset retirement obligations have been recognized because the fair value of the conditional legal obligation cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligation. Settlement of these conditional asset retirement obligations is not expected to

have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. 

Depreciation is provided by utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets requires that the Partnership assess long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Other factors considered by the Partnership when determining if an impairment assessment is necessary include, but are not limited to, significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the United States and world economies and uncertainties associated with governmental actions. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

The accounting guidance for goodwill and intangible assets requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2015 , the Partnership's recorded goodwill was $5,814 . See Note 8 for more information on the Partnership's annual goodwill impairment test. 

Turnaround Costs 

The Partnership accounts for turnaround costs under the deferral method. Turnarounds are the scheduled and required shutdowns of specific operating units in order to perform planned major maintenance activities. The costs related to the significant overhaul and refurbishment activities include maintenance materials, parts and direct labor costs. The costs of the turnaround are deferred when incurred at the time of the turnaround and amortized (within depreciation and amortization) on a straight-line basis until the next planned turnaround, which ranges from three &#32;to six &#32;years. Deferred turnaround costs are presented as a component of other assets, net. The cash outflows related to these costs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Exchanges 

The Partnership enters into inventory exchange transactions with respect to ethylene. These exchanges are settled in like-kind quantities and are valued at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Partnership to concentration of risk consist principally of trade receivables from third-party customers who purchase ethylene and ethylene co-products. The Partnership performs periodic credit evaluations, as applicable, of the customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Partnership maintains allowances for potential losses, as applicable.

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts. Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded. 

Net Income per Unit 

The accounting guidance for earnings per unit requires the Partnership to present basic earnings per unit and diluted earnings per unit. Net income per unit applicable to common limited partner units and to subordinated limited partner units is computed by dividing the respective limited partners' interest in net income by the weighted average number of common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights outstanding. Because the Partnership has more than one class of participating securities, it uses the two-class method when calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners. The classes of participating securities include common units and subordinated units. Diluted net income per limited partner unit is the same as basic net income per limited partner unit, as there were no potentially dilutive common or subordinated units outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . During the period presented prior to the IPO, the Predecessor was wholly owned by Westlake. Accordingly, the Predecessor has not presented net income per unit. 

Derivative Instruments 

The accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that the Partnership and the Predecessor recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in the derivative's fair value must be currently recognized in earnings or comprehensive income, depending on the designation of the derivative. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in comprehensive income and is recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings currently. 

The Predecessor utilized commodity derivative instruments to reduce price risks by purchasing or selling futures on established exchanges. The Predecessor took both fixed and variable positions, depending upon anticipated future physical purchases and sales of these commodities. The fair value of derivative financial instruments was estimated using quoted market prices in active markets and observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that were corroborated by market data when active markets were not available. The Predecessor assessed both counterparty as well as its own nonperformance risk when measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities. The Predecessor did not consider its nonperformance risk to be significant. The Partnership did not enter into any commodity derivative instruments since the date of the IPO on August 4, 2014. During 2015, the Partnership entered into an interest rate contract with Westlake designed to reduce the risks of variability of the interest rates under the MLP Revolver. The interest rate contract fixed the LIBOR component of the interest rate for a portion of the MLP Revolver balance and was designated as a cash flow hedge. During 2014 and 2013, the Predecessor had no cash flow hedges. See Note 15 for more information on the derivative instruments and Note 16 for a summary of the fair value of derivative instruments. 

Environmental Costs 

Environmental costs relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on whether such costs provide future economic benefits. Remediation liabilities are recognized when the costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Environmental liabilities in connection with properties that are sold or closed are realized upon such sale or closure, to the extent they are probable and estimable and not previously reserved. Recognition of any joint and several liabilities is based upon the Partnership's best estimate of its final pro rata share of the liability. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the Partnership's debt differs from the carrying value due to the long-term maturities of the debt. The fair value of the financial instruments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets and observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

corroborated by market data when active markets are not available or unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. See Note 16 for more information on the fair value of financial instruments. 

Income Taxes &#32; 

The Partnership is a limited partnership and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, is not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. The Partnership is, however, subject to state and local income taxes. The Predecessor's operating results were included in Westlake's consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Amounts presented in the combined financial statements prior to the IPO relate to income taxes that have been determined on a separate tax return basis and the Predecessor's contribution to Westlake Chemical Corporation's net operating losses and tax credits have been included in the Predecessor's financial statements. The Predecessor utilized the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances were recorded against deferred tax assets when it was considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized on a separate tax return basis. 

Segment Reporting 

The Partnership accounts for segment reporting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance, which establishes standards for entities to report information about the operating segments and geographic areas in which they operate. The Partnership only operates one segment (natural gas liquids processing) and all of its operations are located in the United States. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Net Investment 

In the consolidated and combined statements of changes in equity, net investment represents Westlake's historical investment in the Predecessor, its accumulated net earnings after taxes and the net effect of transactions with, and allocations from, Westlake. 

Other Assets 

Certain other assets (see Note 8) are amortized over periods ranging from five &#32;to 15 &#32;years using the straight-line method. 

Comprehensive Income 

The Partnership has reported no &#32;comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the absence of items of other comprehensive income. 

2. Initial Public Offering and Purchase of Additional Interests 

Initial Public Offering 

On July 30, 2014, the Partnership's common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "WLKP." On August 4, 2014, the Partnership completed the IPO of 12,937,500 &#32;common units at a price to the public of $24.00 &#32;per unit ( $22.53 &#32;per unit net of underwriting discount), including 1,687,500 &#32;common units that were issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters' over-allotment option. 

In connection with the IPO, in exchange for Westlake's contribution of a 5.8% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo and OpCo's general partner interest to the Partnership, Westlake received: 

&#8226; 

1,436,115 &#32;common units and 12,686,115 &#32;subordinated units; and 

&#8226; 

the Partnership's general partner interest and its incentive distribution rights. 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL PARTNERS LP 

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

The Partnership received net proceeds of $286,088 &#32;from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts, structuring fees and offering expenses of approximately $24,412 . The Partnership used the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase an additional 4.8% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo, resulting in the Partnership owning a 10.6% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo. The Partnership recorded the incremental 4.8% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo at its historical carrying value of $43,516 &#32;and the excess cash paid over historical carrying value of $242,572 &#32;as a decrease to the General partner&#8212;Westlake capital account. 

From the period beginning August 4, 2012 to July 31, 2013, Westlake incurred approximately $151,729 &#32;in capital expenditures (the "Pre-August 2013 Capex") with respect to the assets contributed to OpCo. The portion of these capital expenditures incurred before January 1, 2013 was accounted for as an adjustment to Net investment, as it was funded through equity. The portion of the capital expenditures incurred from January 1, 2013 through July 31, 2013 was accounted for as a liability and is reflected as such on the Predecessor's combined financial statements, and the associated liability was retained by Westlake in connection with the IPO. During the period from August 1, 2013 through August 3, 2014, Westlake funded capital expenditures of $246,056 &#32;related to the Contributed Assets under the terms of the August 2013 Promissory Notes. At the close of the IPO, the outstanding balance of the August 2013 Promissory Notes was $246,056 . 

OpCo used the $286,088 &#32;it received from the Partnership in exchange for a 4.8% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo to (1) establish a $55,419 &#32;turnaround reserve, (2) reimburse Westlake $151,729 &#32;for the Pre-August 2013 Capex, and (3) repay $78,940 &#32;of the August 2013 Promissory Notes assumed by OpCo. Immediately after the repayment, the outstanding indebtedness payable to Westlake under the August 2013 Promissory Notes was $167,116 . 

Agreements with Westlake and Related Parties 

The agreements described below became effective on August 4, 2014, concurrent with the closing of the IPO. 

Ethylene Sales Agreement 

OpCo entered into a 12 -year ethylene sales agreement with Westlake (the "Ethylene Sales Agreement"). The Ethylene Sales Agreement requires Westlake to purchase a minimum volume of ethylene each year equal to 95% &#32;of OpCo's planned ethylene production per year (the "Minimum Commitment"), subject to certain exceptions and a maximum commitment of 3.8 billion &#32;pounds per year. So long as Westlake is not in default under the Ethylene Sales Agreement, if OpCo's actual production exceeds planned production, Westlake has the option to purchase up to 95% &#32;of the excess production (the "Excess Production Option"). 

The fee for each pound of ethylene purchased by Westlake from OpCo up to the Minimum Commitment in any calendar year will equal: 

&#8226; 

the actual price OpCo pays Westlake to purchase ethane (or other feedstock, such as propane, if applicable) to produce each pound of ethylene, subject to a specified cap and a floor on the amount of feedstock that should be needed to produce each pound of ethylene; plus 

&#8226; 

the actual price OpCo pays Westlake to purchase natural gas to produce each pound of ethylene, subject to a specified cap and a floor on the amount of natural gas that should be needed to produce each pound of ethylene; plus 

&#8226; 

OpCo's estimated operating costs (including selling, general and administrative expenses), divided by OpCo's planned ethylene production for the year (in pounds); plus 

&#8226; 

a five -year average of OpCo's expected future maintenance capital expenditures and other turnaround expenditures, divided by OpCo's planned ethylene production capacity for the year (in pounds); less 

&#8226; 

the proceeds (on a per pound of ethylene basis) received by OpCo from the sale of co-products (including, but not limited to, propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen) associated with producing the ethylene purchased by Westlake; plus 

&#8226; 

a $0.10 &#32;per pound margin. 

The fee for the Excess Production Option, if exercised, equals OpCo's estimated variable operating costs of producing the incremental ethylene, net of revenues from co-products sales plus a $0.10 &#32;per pound margin. 

The estimated operating costs and the expected future maintenance capital expenditures and other turnaround expenditures will be adjusted at the end of each year, to be applicable for the fee for the next calendar year, to reflect certain changes in forecasted costs. 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL PARTNERS LP 

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

The result of the fee structure is that OpCo should recover the portion of its total operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures and other turnaround expenditures corresponding to the portion of OpCo's aggregate production that is purchased by Westlake. Any shortfall in recovery of such costs is recognized during the current year and is recoverable from Westlake in the subsequent year. 

The Ethylene Sales Agreement has an initial term extending until December 31, 2026 and automatically renews thereafter for successive 12 -month terms unless terminated. 

Feedstock Supply Agreement 

OpCo entered into a feedstock supply agreement with Westlake, pursuant to which Westlake agreed to sell to OpCo ethane and other feedstock in amounts sufficient for OpCo to produce the ethylene to be sold under the Ethylene Sales Agreement (the "Feedstock Supply Agreement"). The Feedstock Supply Agreement provides that OpCo may obtain feedstock from Westlake based on Westlake's total cost of purchasing and delivering the feedstock, including applicable transportation, storage and other costs. Title and risk of loss for all feedstock purchased by OpCo through the Feedstock Supply Agreement passes to OpCo upon delivery to one of three delivery points described in the Feedstock Supply Agreement. 

The Feedstock Supply Agreement has an initial term extending until December 31, 2026 and automatically renews thereafter for successive 12 -month terms unless terminated by either party; provided, however, that such agreement can only be renewed in the event the Ethylene Sales Agreement is renewed simultaneously. The Feedstock Supply Agreement may, in certain circumstances, terminate concurrently with the termination of the Ethylene Sales Agreement. 

Services and Secondment Agreement 

OpCo entered into a Services and Secondment Agreement with Westlake, pursuant to which OpCo provides Westlake with certain services required for the operation of Westlake's facilities; and Westlake provides OpCo with comprehensive operating services for OpCo's facilities, ranging from services relating to the maintenance and operations of the common facilities necessary for the operation of OpCo's units, to making available certain shared utilities such as electricity and natural gas that are necessary for the operation of OpCo's units. Westlake also seconds employees to OpCo to allow OpCo to operate its facilities. Such seconded employees will be under the control of OpCo while they work on OpCo's facilities. 

The Services and Secondment Agreement has an initial 12 -year term. The Services and Secondment Agreement may be renewed thereafter upon agreement of the parties and shall automatically terminate if the Ethylene Sales Agreement terminates under certain circumstances. Westlake and OpCo each can terminate the Services and Secondment Agreement under certain circumstances, including if the other party materially defaults on the performance of its obligations and such default continues for a 30 -day period. 

Site Lease Agreements 

OpCo entered into two &#32;site lease agreements with Westlake pursuant to which Westlake leases to OpCo the real property underlying Lake Charles Olefins and Calvert City Olefins, respectively, and grants OpCo rights to access and use certain other portions of Westlake's natural gas liquids processing facilities that are necessary to operate OpCo's production facilities. OpCo owes Westlake one &#32;dollar per site per year. The site lease agreements each have a term of 50 &#32;years. Each of the site lease agreements may be renewed if agreed by the parties. 

Omnibus Agreement 

The Partnership entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Westlake that addresses (1) Westlake's indemnification of the Partnership for certain matters, including environmental and tax matters, (2) the provision by Westlake of certain management and other general and administrative services to the Partnership and its general partner and (3) the Partnership's reimbursement to Westlake for such services. The Omnibus Agreement also addresses Westlake's right of first refusal on any proposed transfer of the natural gas liquids processing facilities that serve Westlake's other facilities and Westlake's right of first refusal on any proposed transfer of the Partnership's equity interests in OpCo. 

Purchase of Additional Interests in OpCo 

On April 29, 2015, the Partnership purchased an additional 2.7% &#32;newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo for approximately $135.3 million , resulting in an aggregate 13.3% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo effective April 1, 2015. In order to fund this purchase, the Partnership entered into a revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $300.0 million &#32;with

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

a subsidiary of Westlake. Westlake owns the remaining 86.7% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo, which is recorded as noncontrolling interest in the 2015 consolidated financial statements. 

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update on a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance. The new accounting guidance creates a framework by which an entity will allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Under the new standard, entities will be required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when an entity satisfies its performance obligations. The standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning that the standard is applied to all of the periods presented with a cumulative catch-up as of the earliest period presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative catch-up as of the current period. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for the revenue recognition standard. The accounting standard will now be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Partnership is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items 

In January 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, an unusual and infrequent event or transaction is no longer allowed to be separately disclosed as "extraordinary." The standard retains the existing requirement to separately present items that are of an unusual nature or occur infrequently on a pre-tax basis within income from continuing operations. The new guidance also requires similar separate presentation of items that are both unusual and infrequent on a pre-tax basis within income from continuing operations. The standard allows for either prospective or retrospective application. If adopted prospectively, both the nature and amount of any subsequent adjustments to previously reported extraordinary items must be disclosed. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have an impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 

In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making certain changes to the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new standard changes the consideration of substantive rights; related party interests and fees paid to the decision maker when applying the variable interest entity consolidation model and eliminate certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have an impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions 

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring that the earnings of transferred net assets from a general partner prior to the dropdown date of the net assets to a master limited partnership be allocated entirely to the general partner when calculating earnings per unit under the two class method. As a result, previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners will not change as a result of a dropdown transaction. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods and interim periods within those reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. 

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Under the new standard, entities will no longer need to calculate other measures of "market." The new accounting guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out and the retail inventory method. The accounting

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 

In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have an impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 

4. Financial Instruments 

Cash Equivalents 

The Partnership had $150,031 &#32;and $40,003 &#32;of held-to-maturity securities with original maturities of three months or less, primarily consisting of corporate debt securities, classified as cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , respectively. The Partnership's investments in held-to-maturity securities are held at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Goodwill 

The impairment test for the recorded goodwill was performed in October 2015 &#32;and did not indicate impairment of the goodwill. The fair value of the goodwill was calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections were based on a nine -year forecast, from 2016 to 2024, to reflect the cyclicality of the Partnership's business. The forecast was based on (1) prices and spreads projected by IHS Chemical, a chemical industry organization offering market and business advisory services for the chemical market, for the same period, and (2) estimates by management, including their strategic and operational plans. Other significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projection included sales volumes based on current capacities. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 8.8% . The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. Under the discounted cash flow methodology, even if the fair value of OpCo decreased by 10% , the carrying value of OpCo would not exceed its fair value.

Long-term debt payable to Westlake 

&#160; 

$

&#160; 

$ 

227,638 

In 2013, the August 2013 Promissory Notes were issued for capital expenditures incurred by Westlake on behalf of the Predecessor's operations. Proceeds drawn under the August 2013 Promissory Notes during 2014 were used to fund capital expenditures at the Predecessor's ethylene plants. In connection with the IPO, OpCo assumed the August 2013 Promissory Notes and used proceeds from the IPO to repay a portion of the balance it assumed. See Note 2 for a description of the August 2013 Promissory Notes and proceeds used to repay balances of such promissory notes assumed in connection with the IPO. 

In connection with the IPO on August 4, 2014, OpCo entered into a $600,000 &#32;senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with Westlake (the "OpCo Revolver"). The OpCo Revolver accrues interest quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.0% , which may be paid-in-kind as an addition to the principal at OpCo's option. Proceeds drawn under the OpCo Revolver during 2015 were used to fund capital expenditures at OpCo's ethylene plants. 

On April 29, 2015, the Partnership entered into a $300,000 &#32;revolving credit facility agreement with Westlake (the "MLP Revolver") to fund the Partnership's purchase of an additional 2.7% &#32;newly-issued, limited partner interest in OpCo for $135,341 . Borrowings under the MLP Revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% &#32;to 3.0% &#32;(depending on the Partnership's consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. The MLP Revolver provides that the Partnership may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. The MLP Revolver requires that the Partnership maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of either (1) during any one-year period following certain types of acquisitions (including acquisitions of additional interests in OpCo), 5.50 :1.00 or less, or (2) during any other period, 4.50 :1.00 or less. The MLP Revolver also contains certain other customary covenants. The repayment of borrowings under the MLP Revolver is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default. During August 2015, the Partnership entered into an interest rate contract with Westlake to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate for a portion of the MLP Revolver balance. The interest rate contract terminates on the earlier of the MLP Revolver maturity date or in August 2018. See note 15 for additional information on the interest rate contract. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Partnership was in compliance with all of the covenants under the August 2013 Promissory Notes, the OpCo Revolver and the MLP Revolver. 

The weighted average interest rate on all long-term debt was 3.30% &#32;and 4.35% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Partnership had no maturities of long-term debt until 2018. The MLP Revolver matures on April 29, 2018, the OpCo Revolver matures on August 4, 2019, and the August 2013 Promissory Notes mature on August 1, 2023. 

10. Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit 

On February 1, 2016 , the board of directors of Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC ("Westlake GP") announced a quarterly cash distribution for the period from October 1, 2015 &#32;to December 31, 2015 &#32;of $0.3080 &#32;per unit, or $8,335 &#32;in total. This distribution was paid on February 26, 2016 &#32;to unitholders of record on February 11, 2016 . 

Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the table below represents total cash distributions and the related periods pertaining to such distributions.

______________________________ 

(1) 

2014 per unit amount represents cash distributions for the period since the IPO through December 31, 2014. 

Net income per unit applicable to common limited partner units and to subordinated limited partner units is computed by dividing the respective limited partners' interest in net income by the weighted-average number of common units and subordinated units outstanding for the period. Because the Partnership has more than one class of participating securities, Partnership uses the two-class method when calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners. The classes of participating securities include common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights. Basic and diluted net income per unit is the same because the Partnership does not have any potentially dilutive units outstanding for the periods presented. Net income per unit is only calculated for the periods subsequent to the IPO as no units were outstanding prior to August 4, 2014.

General 

OpCo, together with other subsidiaries of Westlake not included in these consolidated and combined financial statements, are guarantors under Westlake's revolving credit facility and the indentures governing its senior notes. As of December 31, 2015 , Westlake had outstanding letters of credit totaling $30,098 &#32;under its revolving credit facility and $754,000 &#32;principal amount outstanding under its senior notes (less the unamortized discount of $774 ). 

The indentures governing Westlake's senior notes prevent OpCo from making distributions to the Partnership if any default or event of default (as defined in the indentures) exists. However, Westlake's credit facility does not prevent OpCo from making distributions to the Partnership. 

During August 2015, the Partnership entered into an interest rate contract with Westlake to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate for a portion of the MLP Revolver balance. See note 15 for additional information on the interest rate contract. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership reimbursed $1,033 &#32;to Westlake for certain state tax payments.

OpCo has entered into two &#32;site lease agreements with Westlake in connection with the IPO, and each has a term of 50 &#32;years. Pursuant to the site lease agreements, OpCo pays Westlake one &#32;dollar per site per year. 

12. Partners' Equity 

Common Unit 

As described below, the common unitholders have preference over subordinated unitholders on receipt of distributions, including, in certain circumstances, cash distributions upon liquidation, as set out in the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership Agreement"). The common unitholders have limited rights on matters affecting Partnership's business, limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect the general partner or its directors. 

Subordinated Unit 

The subordinated unitholders have similar rights as the common unitholders. However, during the subordination period, the subordinated unitholders are not entitled to receive quarterly distributions from operating surplus until the common unitholders have received the minimum quarterly distribution from operating surplus and, among other things, in certain circumstances, are subordinated in the receipt of cash distributions upon liquidation. The subordination period will end on the first business day after the Partnership has earned and paid an aggregate amount of at least the minimum quarterly distribution multiplied by the total number of outstanding common and subordinated units for each of three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods ending on or after June 30, 2017 and there are no outstanding arrearages on the Partnership's common units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the subordination period will end on the first business day after the Partnership has paid an aggregate amount of at least 150.0% &#32;of the minimum quarterly distribution on an annualized basis multiplied by the total number of outstanding common and subordinated units and have earned that amount plus the related distribution on the incentive distribution rights, for any four-quarter period ending on or after June 30, 2015 and there are no outstanding arrearages on Partnership's common units. 

Incentive Distribution Rights 

The Partnership Agreement generally provides that the Partnership will distribute cash each quarter during the subordination period in the following manner: first, to the holders of common units, until each common unit has received the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2750 , plus any arrearages from prior quarters; second, to the holders of subordinated units, until each subordinated unit has received the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2750 ; and third, to the holders of common and subordinated units, pro rata, until each unit has received a distribution of $0.3163 . If cash distributions to the Partnership's unitholders exceed $0.3163 &#32;per common unit and subordinated unit in any quarter, the Partnership's unitholders and Westlake, as the holder of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights, will receive distributions according to the following percentage allocations:

13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss primarily reflects the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative instrument designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge. Gain or loss amounts related to a cash flow hedge recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss are reclassified to income in the same period in which the underlying hedged forecasted transaction affects income. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the related net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss is immediately reclassified into income. 

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income was as follows: &#160;

14. Unit-based Compensation 

The Westlake Chemical Partners LP Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") was adopted on July 15, 2014 and provides for grants of unit options, restricted units, phantom units, unit awards, distribution equivalent rights ("DERs") and other unit-based awards. The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential for the growth and profitability of the Partnership and to encourage such individuals to devote their best efforts to advancing the business of the Partnership and its affiliates. Awards under the Plan are determined by the board of directors of the Partnership's general partner or a committee thereof (the "Committee"). Under the Plan, DERs may be granted, which represent a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, units, restricted units and/or phantom units, as determined by the Committee at its sole discretion, equal in value to the cash distributions made by the Partnership with respect to a common unit during the period such award is outstanding. The terms and conditions of each award are determined by the Committee. The maximum number of common units of the Partnership that may be delivered with respect to awards under the Plan is 1,270,000 . During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014, 16,963 &#32;phantom units along with a corresponding number of DERs were granted to certain non-employee directors of the general partner of the Partnership, which will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. There were no forfeitures under the Plan during 2014 and 2015. 

Non-vested phantom unit awards as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and awards granted during the respective periods were as follows: &#160;

Each phantom unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one Partnership common unit. Each DER has distribution rights only so long as the phantom units to which it relates to has not vested or been settled. 

The awards, which are classified as liability awards for financial accounting purposes, are re-measured at each reporting date until they vest. The total units available for grant at December 31, 2015 &#32;were 1,253,037 . The total compensation cost recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was $75 &#32;and for the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014 &#32;was $15 , and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and classified as a liability in the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. The unrecognized compensation cost associated with all grants under the Plan at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $286 &#32;and the weighted average remaining term of the units at December 31, 2015 &#32;was 2.29 years .

15. Derivative Instruments 

Commodity Risk Management 

The Predecessor used derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on raw materials and products, as a substantial portion of its raw materials and products were commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. The Predecessor employed strategies to protect against such instability, including ethylene product feedstock flexibility. The Predecessor did not use derivative instruments to engage in speculative activities. The Contributed Assets did not include the entity engaged in commodity risk management activities or any of its open derivative positions. The Partnership has not engaged in any hedging activity and did not use any derivative instruments related to the commodities in the period subsequent to the IPO through December 31, 2014 or during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gains or losses on the derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are included in cost of sales in the consolidated and combined statements of operations. There were no &#32;derivative instruments that were designated as fair value hedges for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The following tables reflect the impact of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item on the combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.

There was no &#32;open derivative position related to commodities at December 31, 2014 &#32;or 2015 . 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

During August 2015, the Partnership entered into an interest rate contract with Westlake designed to reduce the risks of variability of the interest rate under the MLP Revolver. The interest rate contract fixed the LIBOR component of the interest rate for a portion of the MLP Revolver balance. This contract was designated as a cash flow hedge. With the exception of this interest rate contract, the Partnership did not have any other derivative financial instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015 . For the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013, neither the Partnership nor the Predecessor had any interest rate contracts. 

The fair value of the derivative instrument on the Partnership's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was as follows:

See Note 16 for the fair value of derivative instruments. 

16. Fair Value Measurements 

The Partnership reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, inputs used to measure fair value are classified in one of three levels: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 

There were no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 . The following table summarizes, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Partnership's asset under the interest rate contract that was accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015 .

&#160; 

&#160; 

Asset&#8212;Interest rate contract 

&#160; 

$ 

&#160; 

$ 

The fair value of the Level 2 interest rate contract is determined using standard valuation methodologies which incorporate relevant contract terms along with readily available market data (i.e. the 3 month LIBOR forward curve). There were no transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during 2015 . 

In addition to the above, the Partnership has other financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable and long-term debt payable to Westlake, all of which are recorded at carrying value. The amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying and fair values of the Partnership's long-term debt at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are summarized in the table below. The Partnership's long-term debt includes the August 2013 Promissory Notes, the OpCo Revolver and the MLP Revolver. The fair value of debt is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using a discounted cash flow methodology. Because the Partnership's valuation methodology used for long-term debt requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the Partnership's long-term debt are classified as Level 3

17. Income Taxes 

The Partnership is a limited partnership and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, is not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. The Partnership is, however, subject to state and local income taxes. The Predecessor's operating results were included in Westlake's consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Amounts presented in the combined financial statements prior to the IPO relate to income taxes that have been determined on a separate tax return basis and the Predecessor's contribution to Westlake Chemical Corporation's net operating losses and tax credits have been included in the Predecessor's financial statements.

18. Supplemental Information 

Accrued Liabilities 

Accrued liabilities were $23,407 &#32;and $11,900 &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Accruals related to capital expenditures and maintenance expenses, which are components of accrued liabilities, were $14,745 &#32;and $2,949 &#32;at December 31, 2015 , respectively, and were $5,026 &#32;and $1,535 &#32;at December 31, 2014 , respectively. No other component of accrued liabilities was more than five percent of total current liabilities. 

Cash Flow Information 

Non-cash Operating Activity 

The Predecessor settled $9,315 &#32;of its total interest expense incurred on long-term debt payable to Westlake as an addition to principal on debt outstanding in 2014 . 

Non-cash Investing Activity 

The change in capital expenditure accrual reducing &#32;additions to property, plant and equipment was $14,552 , $418 &#32;and $7,937 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Non-cash Financing Activity 

Related party notes payable to Westlake of $238,600 &#32;were deemed settled through net investment in 2014 . The non-cash settlement was recorded as an increase in Westlake's net investment in the Predecessor. No &#32;cash was transferred in connection with the deemed settlement of these notes. 

Interest and Income Taxes 

Interest paid by the Partnership, net of interest capitalized was $9,538 &#32;and $1,366 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Income tax paid by the Partnership was $1,264 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , of which $231 &#32;was paid directly to the tax authorities and $1,033 &#32;was paid to Westlake as reimbursement. No &#32;income tax payments were made in 2014 &#32;by the Partnership. Westlake uses a centralized cash management system to finance its operations. As such, interest, net of interest capitalized, and income taxes were paid directly by Westlake and charged to the Predecessor through related party accounts receivable, net prior to the IPO. Related party accounts receivable, net were settled immediately through net investment and, therefore, the Predecessor did not pay cash for interest expense or income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 . 

19. Commitments and Contingencies 

The Partnership is subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose civil and criminal sanctions and that may require the Partnership to mitigate the effects of contamination caused by the release or disposal of hazardous substances into the environment. These laws include the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Under CERCLA, an owner or operator of property may be held strictly liable for remediating contamination without regard to whether

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

that person caused the contamination, and without regard to whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. Because the Partnership's production sites have a history of industrial use, it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these legal requirements will have on the Partnership. Westlake will indemnify the Partnership for liabilities that occurred or existed prior to August 4, 2014. 

Contract Disputes with Goodrich and PolyOne . In connection with the 1990 and 1997 acquisitions of the Goodrich Corporation ("Goodrich") chemical manufacturing facility in Calvert City, Kentucky, which is a portion of the B.F. Goodrich superfund site, Goodrich agreed to indemnify Westlake for any liabilities related to preexisting contamination at the site. Westlake agreed to indemnify Goodrich for post-closing contamination caused by Westlake's operations. The soil and groundwater at the site had been extensively contaminated under Goodrich's operations. In 1993, Goodrich spun off the predecessor of PolyOne Corporation ("PolyOne"), and that predecessor assumed Goodrich's indemnification obligations relating to preexisting contamination. 

In 2003, litigation arose among Westlake, Goodrich and PolyOne with respect to the allocation of the cost of remediating contamination at the site. The parties settled this litigation in December 2007, and the case was dismissed. In the settlement the parties agreed that, among other things: (1) PolyOne would pay 100% &#32;of the costs (with specified exceptions), net of recoveries or credits from third parties, incurred with respect to environmental issues at the Calvert City site from August 1, 2007 forward; (2) either Westlake or PolyOne might, from time to time in the future (but not more than once every five years), institute an arbitration proceeding to adjust that percentage; and (3) Westlake and PolyOne would negotiate a new environmental remediation utilities and Services and Secondment Agreement to cover Westlake's provision to or on behalf of PolyOne of certain environmental remediation services at the site. The current environmental remediation activities at the Calvert City site do not have a specified termination date but are expected to last for the foreseeable future. The costs incurred by Westlake that have been invoiced to PolyOne to provide the environmental remediation services were $2,210 , $2,805 &#32;and $3,284 &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013, respectively. By letter dated March 16, 2010, PolyOne notified Westlake that it was initiating an arbitration proceeding under the settlement agreement. In this proceeding, PolyOne sought to readjust the percentage allocation of costs and to recover approximately $1,400 &#32;from Westlake in reimbursement of previously paid remediation costs. In December 2015, the arbitration panel dismissed the proceeding with prejudice. In a separate proceeding in Ohio state court, Westlake is seeking certain insurance documents from PolyOne. 

Westlake will indemnify the Partnership for liabilities that occurred or existed prior to August 4, 2014. 

State Administrative Proceedings . There are several administrative proceedings in Kentucky involving Westlake, Goodrich and PolyOne related to the same manufacturing site in Calvert City, which includes OpCo's natural gas liquids processing facility in Calvert City. In 2003, the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet (the "Cabinet") re-issued Goodrich's RCRA permit which requires Goodrich to remediate contamination at the Calvert City manufacturing site. Both Goodrich and PolyOne challenged various terms of the permit in an attempt to shift Goodrich's clean-up obligations under the permit to Westlake. Westlake intervened in the proceedings. The Cabinet has suspended all corrective action under the RCRA permit in deference to a remedial investigation and feasibility study ("RIFS") being conducted, under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement ("AOC"), which became effective on December 9, 2009. See "Federal Administrative Proceedings" below. Periodic status conferences will be held to evaluate whether additional proceedings will be required. 

Federal Administrative Proceedings . In May 2009, the Cabinet sent a letter to the EPA requesting the EPA's assistance in addressing contamination at the Calvert City site under CERCLA. In its response to the Cabinet, the EPA stated that it concurred with the Cabinet's request and would incorporate work previously conducted under the Cabinet's RCRA authority into the EPA's cleanup efforts under CERCLA. Since 1983, the EPA has been addressing contamination at an abandoned landfill adjacent to the Partnership's plant which had been operated by Goodrich and which was being remediated pursuant to CERCLA. The EPA has directed Goodrich and PolyOne to conduct additional investigation activities at the landfill and at the Calvert City site. In June 2009, the EPA notified Westlake that Westlake may have potential liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA at its plant site. Liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA is strict and joint and several. The EPA also identified Goodrich and PolyOne, among others, as potentially responsible parties at the plant site. Westlake negotiated, in conjunction with the other potentially responsible parties, an AOC and an order to conduct an RIFS. Due to the Partnership's ownership and current operation of the property, the Partnership may be subject to additional requirements and liabilities under CERCLA. 

Potential Flare Modifications . For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. A number of companies have entered into consent agreements with the EPA requiring both modifications to reduce flare emissions and the installation of additional

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except unit amounts and per unit data) 

equipment to better track flare operations and emissions. On April 21, 2014, Westlake received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City and Lake Charles facilities. Westlake submitted information pursuant to such request, including information regarding three flares that the Partnership owns. The EPA has informed Westlake that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has demanded that Westlake conduct additional flare sampling and provide supplemental information. Westlake is currently in negotiations with the EPA regarding these demands, some of which are applicable to the Partnership's flares. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree with that would obligate Westlake to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. Westlake has not agreed that any flares are out of compliance or that any corrective actions are warranted. Depending on the outcome of Westlake's negotiations with the EPA, additional controls on emissions from the Partnership's flares may be required and these could result in increased capital and operating costs. 

Louisiana Notice of Violations . The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ("LDEQ") has issued notices of violations ("NOVs") regarding the Partnership's assets, and those of Westlake, for various air compliance issues. The Partnership and Westlake are working with LDEQ to settle these claims, and a global settlement of all claims is being discussed. While settlement may result in a total civil penalty in excess of $100 , such a settlement will likely cover assets owned by the Partnership and Westlake, and to the extent it covers the Partnership's assets, Westlake has reached a verbal agreement with the LDEQ to settle various NOVs in two separate settlements for a combined $192 &#32;in civil penalties. 

Westlake will indemnify the Partnership for liabilities that occurred or existed prior to August 4, 2014. 

In addition to the matters described above, the Partnership is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The Partnership does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Other Commitments 

The Partnership is obligated under various long-term and short-term noncancelable operating leases, primarily related to rail car leases and land. Several of the leases provide for renewal terms. At December 31, 2015 , future minimum lease commitments were as follows:

The Partnership has various purchase commitments for its capital projects and for materials, supplies and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Such commitments are at prices not in excess of market prices. 

20. Major Customer and Concentration of Credit Risk 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Westlake accounted for approximately 82.9% , 73.8% &#32;and 75.3% , respectively, of the Partnership's and the Predecessor's net sales. 

21. Subsequent Events 

Distribution 

On February 1, 2016 , the Board of Directors of the Partnership's general partner announced a quarterly distribution of $0.3080 &#32;per unit, or $8,335 &#32;in total, which was paid on February 26, 2016 &#32;to unitholders of record as of February 11, 2016 . 

General 

The financial statements of the Partnership are substantially comprised of the financial statements of OpCo, which issued its annual financial statements on February 24, 2016 . Accordingly, the Partnership has evaluated transactions for consideration as recognized subsequent events in the annual financial statements through the date of February 24, 2016 . Additionally, the Partnership has evaluated transactions that occurred as of the issuance of these financial statements, on March 8, 2016 , for purposes of disclosure of unrecognized subsequent events.

______________________________ 

(1) 

Basic and diluted earnings per common and subordinated unit ("EPU") for each quarter is computed using the weighted average units outstanding during that quarter, while EPU for the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014 is computed using the weighted average units outstanding for the period. As a result, the sum of the EPU for each of the quarters subsequent to the IPO may not equal the EPU for the period from August 4, 2014 through December 31, 2014. 

(2) 

Represents quarterly net income per common and subordinated unit since the completion of the Partnership's IPO on August 4, 2014. See Note 10 to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
