 Item 1: Business General 

Waters Corporation (&#147;Waters &#174; &#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters Division, high performance liquid chromatography (&#147;HPLC&#148;), ultra performance liquid chromatography (&#147;UPLC &#174; &#148; and together with HPLC, referred to as &#147;LC&#148;) and mass spectrometry (&#147;MS&#148;) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (&#147;LC-MS&#148;) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform. Through its TA Division (&#147;TA &#174; &#148;), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company&#146;s instruments, as well as other suppliers&#146; instruments, and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system. 

The Company&#146;s products are used by life science (including pharmaceutical), biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. The Company&#146;s LC and LC-MS instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as &#147;proteomics&#148;), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. The Company&#146;s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. 

Waters, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters became a publicly-traded company with its initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited (&#147;Micromass &#174; &#148;) in September 1997. 

Business Segments 

The Company&#146;s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. The Company operates in the analytical instruments industry by designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing instrument systems, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The Company&#146;s two operating segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. 

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company&#146;s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Waters Division 

High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography 

HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC&#146;s performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications. 

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by life science industries (including pharmaceuticals). In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and their foreign counterparts that mandate testing requiring HPLC instrumentation. 

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC &#174; , to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Company&#146;s software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the Company&#146;s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument. In 2012, the Company introduced UltraPerformance Convergence Chromatography TM (&#147;UPC2 &#174; &#148;) with the release of the ACQUITY &#174; UPC2 &#174; system. This new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography (&#147;SFC&#148;) with the proven UPLC technology, using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase. By varying mobile phase strength, pressure, temperature and stationary phase with UPC 2 , a user can separate, detect and quantify structural analogs, isomers, enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures &#150; all compounds or samples that challenge today&#146;s laboratories. In 2013, the Company introduced the ACQUITY &#174; Advanced Polymer Chromatography &#174; (&#147;APC TM &#148;) system. This system delivers improved polymer peak resolution, particularly for low molecular weight polymers and oligomers, up to 20 times faster than traditional gel permeation chromatography. In 2013, the Company introduced the ACQUITY &#174; QDa &#174; Detector, a compact and easy to operate single quadrupole mass spectrometric module that further supports the broader usage of mass detectors in a form similar to that of the broadly used optical detectors that are routinely used for LC applications. The control and data output of the QDa is compatible with Waters&#146; most commonly used instrument configurations and the QDa is uniquely positioned to offer mass detection to the large and well established markets for HPLC and UPLC systems. In 2014, the Company introduced the ACQUITY UPLC &#174; M-Class instrument system. This system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules, particularly when used with mass spectrometric detection. The innovations incorporated into the ACQUITY UPLC M-Class system are led by its internal low-volume design and newly redesigned fluidics that minimize dispersive and adsorptive losses during a chromatographic separation. In 2015, the Company introduced the ACQUITY &#174; Arc System and its enabling Arc Multi-flow path TM technology, which bridges the gap between HPLC and UPLC by emulating a variety of HPLC systems without altering the method&#146;s gradient table and enabling improved chromatographic performance of methods by leveraging 2.5-2.7 micron particle column technologies. 

&#160; 

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from ultra-violet (&#147;UV&#148;) absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection. 

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica. As the sample permeates through the column, it is separated into its constituent components. 

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors&#146; LC systems. The Company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used primarily on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instruments primarily use ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2013, the Company introduced the CORTECS &#174; family of 1.6 micron solid-core silica-based UPLC columns to further extend the application range and performance of its UPLC offerings. In 2014, the Company expanded its CORTECS family with a new line of 2.7 micron silica-based, solid-core particle columns for usage on UPLC, as well as HPLC systems. In addition, the Company introduced size exclusion chromatography columns for the characterization of proteins and ACQUITY UPC 2 columns for chiral and achiral separations. In 2015, the Company introduced the Oasis &#174; PRiME HLB cartridges, which process samples up to 40% faster and deliver samples that are up to 70% cleaner with fewer LC-MS matrix effects than samples prepared using other extraction techniques. In addition, the ACQUITY UPLC &#174; Glycoprotein BEH Amide columns were introduced in 2015 to help biopharmaceutical companies to better understand where glycan groups (bonded sugars) are located within the therapeutic proteins they are developing and manufacturing. 

The Company&#146;s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products. Environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis. For example, the Company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins (fungal biological contaminants) in various agricultural commodities. These test kits provide reliable, quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of fluorimetry, HPLC or LC-MS. In 2014, the Company introduced the Afla-V &#174; AQUA test strips for detecting aflatoxins in grain and received USDA-GIPSA certification for its Afla-V &#174; lateral flow strip tests for the quantitative analysis of total aflatoxins in corn. 

Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 

MS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions. 

The Company believes it is a technology and market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (&#147;Tof&#148;), magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the speed and/or efficacy of certain experiments. 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof and ion mobility designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC system and a liquid compatible interface (such as an electrospray ionization source) as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide. 

MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The Company&#146;s smaller-sized mass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector (&#147;SQD&#148;) and the tandem quadrupole detector (&#147;TQD&#148;), are often referred to as LC &#147;detectors&#148; and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo &#174; TQ and Xevo &#174; TQ-S instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole time-of-flight (&#147;Q-Tof TM &#148;) instruments, such as the Company&#146;s SYNAPT &#174; G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as &#147;proteomics&#148;. In 2013, the Company introduced the SYNAPT &#174; G2-S i , which combines the unique power of travelling wave (&#147;T-Wave TM &#148;) ion mobility separations with new data acquisition and informatics technologies, and collision cross-section measurements. In 2014, the Company introduced the ionKey/MS TM system, Xevo &#174; G2-XS and Xevo &#174; TQ-S micro. The ionKey/MS system physically integrates a UPLC separation into the mass spectrometer, producing a significant improvement in sensitivity with reduced solvent and sample sizes. The Xevo G2-XS mass spectrometer combines the new XS Collision Cell with the signature technologies of Tof-MRM, StepWave TM and QuanTof TM . The Xevo TQ-S micro is a more compact, research-grade instrument designed to acquire sensitive, robust and dependable data at accelerated rates of acquisition. In 2015, the Company introduced the GlycoWorks TM Rapi Fluor-MS TM N-Glycan Kit, which enables fast de-glycosylation and labeling, reduces sample preparation time and allows mass detection for characterization and development with enhanced sensitivity. In addition, the Company introduced the Vion TM IMS Q-Tof Mass Spectrometer, which is a bench-top tandem mass spectrometer featuring ion mobility and Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (&#147;REIMS TM &#148;) Research System with iKnife TM sampling to combine direct-from-sample ionization with high performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 

In July 2014, the Company acquired the net assets of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. (&#147;Medimass&#148;), a developer of mass spectrometry-related technologies with the potential to be used for a variety of applications, for $23 million in cash. In addition, the Company potentially has to pay additional contingent consideration, which had an estimated fair value of $3 million as of the closing date. The net assets acquired consist primarily of the REIMS technology, including patent applications, software, databases and REIMS expertise. REIMS is an ambient pressure surface ionization technique that, when used with mass spectrometry, can characterize the molecular topography of complex surfaces, such as cellular membranes. 

In November 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of MPE Orbur Group Limited and its sole operating subsidiary, Midland Precision Equipment Company, Ltd. (&#147;MPE&#148;), a manufacturer of MS instrumentation components, for $12 million, net of cash acquired. MPE is a highly skilled manufacturer and former Waters supplier that produces critical components that support the Company&#146;s MS instrument systems. 

LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company&#146;s customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today&#146;s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems. 

&#160; 

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly-disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company believes that it is one of the world&#146;s largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and LC-MS instrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services. The Company also believes that it has the leading combined LC and LC-MS market share in the United States, Europe and Asia (excluding Japan), and believes it may have a market share position in Japan that ranks second to an established domestic supplier. 

The Company has been a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company&#146;s instruments, as well as other suppliers&#146; instruments. The Company&#146;s newest software platform, UNIFI &#174; , is a scientific information system that is the culmination of a multi-year effort to substantially bring all of Waters&#146; preexisting, distinct software systems under one operating system. UNIFI joins Waters&#146; suite of informatics products &#150; Empower &#174; Chromatography Data Software, MassLynx &#174; Mass Spectrometry Software and NuGenesis &#174; Scientific Data Management System, each of which is used to support innovations within world-leading institutions. UNIFI is the industry&#146;s first comprehensive software that seamlessly integrates UPLC chromatography, mass spectrometry and informatics data workflows. In 2014, the Company introduced three new UNIFI-based instrument systems and now offers a total of eight UNIFI-based solutions. In 2015, the Company&#146;s introduction of the Vion IMS Q-Tof Mass Spectrometer marks the first Waters mass spectrometer to be fully supported on UNIFI. 

In August 2013, the Company acquired Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd. (&#147;Nonlinear Dynamics&#148;), a developer of proteomics and metabolomics software, for $23 million in cash. Waters and Nonlinear Dynamics collaborated on the development of the Company&#146;s TransOmics&#153; Informatics, a scalable solution for proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analysis, which was introduced in 2012. In 2014, the Company introduced Progenesis &#174; QI and Progenesis &#174; QI for Proteomics.

TA Division 

Thermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry 

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and characterization of materials in various industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics. 

&#160; 

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under different types of &#147;loading&#148; or other conditions. The information obtained under such conditions provides insight into a material&#146;s behavior during processing, packaging, transport, usage and storage. 

Thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide information useful in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. As with systems offered through the Waters Division, a range of instrument configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For example, the Q-Series TM family of differential scanning calorimeters has included a range of instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a variety of sample cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2011, TA introduced the Discovery DSC, Discovery TGA and Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, which provide leading measurement performance in the fields of differential scanning calorimetry and rheometry. In 2015, TA introduced the TAM IV and TAM IV-48, which extend the operating temperature range (4&#176;C to 150&#176;C) with long-term temperature stability for measuring processes. In 2015, TA also introduced the Affinity ITC and ITC Auto, which are designed for the most challenging life science laboratory environments that require high sensitivity, high productivity and the most advanced isothermal titration calorimetry. 

In July 2013, the Company acquired Scarabaeus Mess-und Prodktionstechnik GmbH (&#147;Scarabaeus&#148;), a manufacturer of rheometers for the rubber and elastomer markets, for $4 million in cash. Key products developed by Scarabaeus include a Mooney Viscometer, Moving Die Rheometer (MDR), Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA) and automated density and hardness testers. The RPA includes many test features and analysis functions that are being used in the latest research and development efforts for rubber and related materials technology. 

In December 2013, the Company acquired Expert Systems Solutions S.r.l. (&#147;ESS&#148;), a manufacturer of advanced thermal analysis instruments, for $3 million in cash.

ULSP&#146;s core business is the manufacturing and servicing of high quality low temperature coolers for thermal analysis and rheology applications, and these products are important accessories for many TA core instrument offerings. In 2014, TA introduced the new Air Chiller System, ACS-3, which is equipped with a three-stage cascading compressor design, enabling testing to temperatures as low as -100&#176;C, a capability that the Company believes competing systems do not possess. 

In May 2015, the Company acquired the net assets of the ElectroForce &#174; business of the Bose Corporation (&#147;ElectroForce&#148;), a manufacturer of testing systems, for $9 million in cash. ElectroForce&#146;s core business is the manufacturing of dynamic mechanical testing systems used to characterize medical devices, biologic and engineered materials. The ElectroForce test instruments are based on unique motor designs that are quiet, energy-efficient, scalable and deliver precise performance over a wide range of force and frequency. 

TA Division Service 

Similar to the Waters Division, the servicing and support of TA&#146;s instruments is an important source of revenue and represents more than 25% of sales for the TA Division. TA sells, supports and services TA&#146;s product 

&#160; 

offerings through its headquarters in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates independently from the Waters Division, though many of its overseas offices are situated in Waters Division&#146;s facilities to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems. 

Customers 

The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Company&#146;s instrument systems is often dependent on its customers&#146; capital spending, or funding as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions, which often fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company&#146;s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs) and biotechnology companies. The Company&#146;s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to universities and governmental agencies worldwide. The Company&#146;s technical sales and support staff members work closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2015, 54% of the Company&#146;s sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 32% to other industrial accounts and 14% to governmental agencies and academic institutions. 

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of many customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. The Company does not rely on any single customer for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of the Company&#146;s net sales. 

Sales and Service 

The Company has one of the largest direct sales and service organizations focused exclusively on the technologies offered by the Company. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service workforces, the Company serves its customer base with 94 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 3,400, 3,100 and 3,000 field representatives in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This investment in sales and service personnel serves to maintain and expand the Company&#146;s installed base of instruments. The Company&#146;s sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service representatives work in the field to install instruments, train customers and minimize instrument downtime. In-house and field-based technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on Company products. The Company provides customers with comprehensive information through various corporate and regional internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.

The Company&#146;s New Castle facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards. 

Raw Materials 

The Company purchases a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings, pre-plated metals and electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by the Company&#146;s operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times. The Company is subject to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company&#146;s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2014, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2015 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2015 Form SD with the SEC in May 2016. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company&#146;s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

The Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that extend, complement and update its existing product offering. The Company&#146;s research and development expenditures for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $119 million, $108 million and $101 million, respectively. In addition, in 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred charges of $4 million and $15 million, respectively, for acquired in-process research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. These licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the Company to make additional future payments of up to $12 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales. 

Nearly all of the Company&#146;s LC products have been developed at the Company&#146;s main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company&#146;s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Company&#146;s MS products are developed at facilities in England and most of the Company&#146;s current materials characterization products are developed at the Company&#146;s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were 955, 875 and 824 employees, respectively, involved in the Company&#146;s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of acquisitions. Despite the Company&#146;s active research and development programs, there can be no assurance that the Company&#146;s product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace. 

Employees 

The Company employed approximately 6,600, 6,200 and 6,000 employees at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with approximately 42% of the Company&#146;s employees located in the United States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The Company&#146;s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations. The Company firmly believes that its future success largely depends upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. 

Competition 

The analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company&#146;s business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Company&#146;s. 

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company&#146;s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by the TA Division, the Company&#146;s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd. and Anton-Paar GmbH. 

The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute 

&#160; 

columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Company&#146;s principal competitors for consumable products have included: Phenomenex, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Agilent Technologies, Inc., General Electric Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instruments. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Company&#146;s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would materially affect the Company&#146;s business as a whole. 

Environmental Matters and Climate Change 

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws. In late 2015, the Company received notification from the EPA informing the Company of an assessment of a $0.4 million fine for EPA violations at its Taunton, Massachusetts facility. The Company has appealed the fine and is currently working with the EPA to implement a remediation plan to correct the underlying issues. The Company believes that the fine and future capital expenditures needed to remediate the issues, which are currently estimated to be less than $2 million, are not material to the Company. 

The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company&#146;s utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company&#146;s carbon footprint. In 2012, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. See Item 1A, Risk Factors &#150; The effects of climate change could harm the Company&#146;s business , for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation.

These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Foreign exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company&#146;s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the Chinese government&#146;s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company&#146;s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions of customers; changes in timing and demand by the Company&#146;s customers and various market sectors, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand; and the Company&#146;s ability to sustain and enhance service. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company&#146;s competitors; introduction of competing 

&#160; 

&#160; products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company&#146;s expectations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased regulatory burdens as the Company&#146;s business evolves, especially with respect to the FDA and EPA, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company&#146;s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. 

&#160;
