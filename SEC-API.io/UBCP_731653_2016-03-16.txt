At December 31, 2015 the Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary bank, The Citizens Savings Bank, Martins Ferry, Ohio (Citizens, or the Bank). The Bank operates two divisions for marketing purposes, The Community Bank, a division of The Citizens Savings Bank and The Citizens Bank, a division of The Citizens Savings Bank. 

&#160;

Citizens offers full brokerage service through LPL Financial&#174; member NASD/SIPC. 

&#160; 

Citizens has no single customer or related group of customers whose banking activities, whether through deposits or lending, would have a material impact on the continued earnings capabilities if those activities were removed. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets in which Citizens operates continue to be highly competitive. Citizens competes for loans and deposits with other retail commercial banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and other types of financial institutions within the Mid-Ohio valley geographic area along the eastern border of Ohio including Belmont, Harrison and Jefferson counties and extending into the northern panhandle of West Virginia and the Tuscarawas and Carroll County geographic areas of northeastern Ohio. Citizens also encounters similar competition for loans and deposits throughout the Athens, and Fairfield County geographic areas of central and southeastern Ohio.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. The business in which the Company and its subsidiary are engaged is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by various bank regulatory authorities. The supervision, regulation and examination to which the Company and its subsidiary are subject are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds that insure the deposits of banks, rather than for the protection of shareholders.

&#160;

Several of the more significant regulatory provisions applicable to banks and bank holding companies to which the Company and Citizens are subject are discussed below. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory provisions. Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and Citizens.

&#160;

Regulatory Reform 

&#160; 

Overview . Congress, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), and the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, have taken broad action since early September 2008 to address volatility in the U.S. banking system and financial markets. Beginning in late 2008, the U.S. and global financial markets experienced deterioration of the worldwide credit markets, which created significant challenges for financial institutions both in the United States and around the world. These actions included the adoption by Congress of both the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#8220;EESA&#8221;), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;). The most recent significant piece of legislation adopted in response to this crisis was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010, and which is discussed more thoroughly below.

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act . The Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including insured depository institutions. Currently, federal regulators are still in the process of drafting the implementing regulations for many portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal regulators continue to implement many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent regulatory body, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#8220;Bureau&#8221;), with authority and responsibility to set rules and regulations for most consumer protection laws applicable to all banks - both large and small. Oversight of Federal consumer financial protection functions have been transferred to the Bureau. The Bureau has responsibility for mortgage reform and enforcement, as well as broad new powers over consumer financial activities which could impact what consumer financial services would be available and how they are provided. The following consumer protection laws are the designated laws that fall under the Bureau&#8217;s rulemaking authority: the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act of 1928, the Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act subject to certain exclusions, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Home Owners Protection Act, certain privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), and the Truth in Lending Act. Review and revision of current financial regulations in conjunction with added new financial service regulations will heighten the regulatory compliance burden and increase litigation risk for the banking industry.

&#160;

The following discussion summarizes other significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that may affect the Company and the Bank:

&#160;

&#183; The deposit insurance assessment base for federal deposit insurance has been shifted from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity; &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act instructs appropriate federal banking agencies to make the capital requirements for banks and savings and loan holding companies and insured depository institutions countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness; &#160;

&#183; The prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand deposits has been repealed, effective July 21, 2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; The standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer has been permanently increased to $250,000 and unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts expired December 31, 2012; &#160;

&#183; Financial holding companies are required to be well-capitalized and well-managed and must continue to be both well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state; &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act extended the application to most bank holding companies of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions, which, among other things, will disallow treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital under certain circumstances; &#160;

&#183; New corporate governance requirements, which are generally applicable to most larger public companies, now require new compensation practices, including, but not limited to, providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation, to consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements; &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, give the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer; and &#160;

&#183; The authority of the FRB to examine financial holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries was expanded. &#160;

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its subsidiaries, their respective customers or the financial services industry more generally. The Company is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with these regulatory requirements.

&#160;

The Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

As a holding company incorporated and doing business within the State of Ohio, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision under the Bank Holding Act of 1956, as amended (the &#34;Act&#34;). The Company is required to file with the Federal ReserveFederal Reserve on quarterly basis information pursuant to the Act. The Federal ReserveFederal Reserve may conduct examinations or inspections of the Company and Citizens.

&#160;

The Company is required to obtain prior approval from the Federal ReserveFederal Reserve for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. In addition, the Company is generally prohibited by the Act from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries. The Company may, however, subject to certain prior approval requirements of the Federal ReserveFederal Reserve, engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in activities which are deemed by the Federal Reserve by order or by regulation to be financial in nature or closely related to banking.

&#160;

On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#34;GLB Act&#34;) was enacted into law. The GLB Act made sweeping changes with respect to the permissible financial services which various types of financial institutions may now provide. The Glass-Steagall Act, which had generally prevented banks from affiliation with securities and insurance firms, was repealed. Pursuant to the GLB Act, bank holding companies may elect to become a &#34;financial holding company,&#34; provided that all of the depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding company are &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulatory standards.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under the GLB Act, a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are &#34;financial in nature&#34; include securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No Federal Reserve approval is required for the Company to acquire a company, other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. Prior Federal Reserve approval is required before the Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company, bank or savings association. If any subsidiary bank of the Company ceases to be &#34;well capitalized&#34; or &#34;well managed&#34; under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve may, among other actions, order the Company to divest the subsidiary bank. Alternatively, the Company may elect to conform its activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company. If any subsidiary bank of the Company receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 of less than satisfactory, the Company will be prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations. The Company is not a financial holding company and has no current intention of making such an election.

&#160; 

Control Acquisitions . The Federal Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring &#34;control&#34; of the Company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. The acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Company, is rebuttably presumed to constitute the acquisition of control of the bank holding company. In addition, a company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of any class of outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, or otherwise obtaining control or a &#34;controlling influence&#34; over that bank holding company.

&#160; 

Liability for Banking Subsidiaries . Under the current Federal Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide it. In the event of the Company's bankruptcy, any commitment to a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

Regulation of the Bank 

&#160;

General . Citizens is an Ohio-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Citizens is therefore regulated by the ODFI as well as the FDIC. The regulatory agencies have the authority to regularly examine Citizens, which is subject to all applicable rules and regulations promulgated by its supervisory agencies. In addition, the deposits of Citizens are insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by law.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance . As an FDIC-insured institution, Citizens is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluations. Institutions classified as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.

&#160;

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. Management of the Company is not aware of any activity or condition that could result in termination of the deposit insurance of Citizens.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act revised the statutory authorities governing the FDIC&#8217;s management of the DIF. Key requirements from the Dodd-Frank Act resulted in the FDIC&#8217;s adoption of new rules in February 2011 regarding Assessments, Dividends, Assessment Base, and Large Bank Pricing. The new rules implemented the following changes: (1) redefined the definition of an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets now defined as &#8220;average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity&#8221;; (2) changed the assessment rate adjustments to better account for risk based on an institution&#8217;s funding sources; (3) revised the deposit insurance assessment rate schedule in light of the new assessment base and assessment rate adjustments; (4) implemented Dodd-Frank Act dividend provisions; (5) revised the large insured depository institution assessment system to better differentiate for risk and to take into account losses the FDIC may incur from large institution failures; and (6) provided technical and other changes to the FDIC&#8217;s assessment rules. Though deposit insurance assessments maintain a risk-based approach, the FDIC imposed a more extensive risk-based assessment system on large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets since they are more complex in nature and could pose greater risk. The rules became effective April 1, 2011 implementing the revised assessment rate schedule for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011.

&#160;

Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company is required by the various regulatory authorities to maintain certain capital levels. Bank holding companies are required to maintain minimum levels of capital in accordance with Federal Reserve Board capital adequacy guidelines. If capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses. The required capital levels and the Company's capital position at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized in the table included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Beginning in 2015, the Company and Bank were required to measure capital adequacy using Basel III accounting. Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. Implementation of the rules will be overseen by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC. Reporting under the new rules began with the March 2015 quarterly regulatory filings.

&#160;

FDICIA 

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#34;FDICIA&#34;), and the regulations promulgated under FDICIA, among other things, established five capital categories for insured depository institutions-well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized-and requires U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for &#34;prompt corrective action&#34; for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements based on these categories. Unless a bank is well capitalized, it is subject to restrictions on its ability to offer brokered deposits and on certain other aspects of its operations. An undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent bank holding company must guarantee the bank's compliance with the plan up to the lesser of 5% of the bank&#8217;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount needed to comply with the plan. As of December 31, 2015 the Bank was well capitalized pursuant to these prompt corrective action guidelines.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Dividends . Ohio law prohibits Citizens, without the prior approval of the ODFI, from paying dividends in an amount greater than the lesser of its undivided profits or the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income from the preceding two years. The payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is also affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations. To this effect, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has issued Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions, and Stock Repurchases by Bank Holding Companies (the &#8220;Policy Statement&#8221;). In the Policy Statement, the Federal Reserve stated that it is important for a banking organization&#8217;s board of directors to ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization&#8217;s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. As a general matter, the Policy Statement provides that the board of directors of a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if:

&#160;

(1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;

(2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or

(3) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

&#160;

Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the organization is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. Moreover, the Policy Statement requires a bank holding company to inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization&#8217;s capital structure. Declaring or paying a dividend in either circumstance could raise supervisory concerns. As described above, Citizens exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

Branching Authority . Ohio chartered banks have the authority under Ohio law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Ohio, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Additionally, in May 1997 Ohio adopted legislation &#8220;opting in&#8221; to the provisions of Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Interstate Act&#8221;) which allows banks to establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks, subject to certain conditions, including certain limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the surviving bank and all of its insured depository institution affiliates. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is also allowed by the Riegle-Neal Act and authorized by Ohio law.

&#160;

Affiliate Transactions . Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, limit borrowings by holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries from affiliated insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their affiliated insured depository institutions on the other. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution's loan to its non-bank affiliates be secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution's transactions with its non-bank affiliates be on arms-length terms.

&#160;

Depositor Preference . The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non deposit creditors and shareholders of the institution.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Privacy Provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act . Under GLB, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of GLB affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

&#160;

Anti-Money Laundering Provisions of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 . On October 26, 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement&#8217;s and the intelligence community&#8217;s ability to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The potential impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide-ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations, including: (a) due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons; (b) standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; and (c) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

&#160;

Fiscal and Monetary Policie s. Citizens&#8217;s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Citizens is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions&#8217; deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason alone, the policies of the Federal Reserve have a material effect on the earnings of Citizens.

&#160;

Additional and Pending Regulation . Citizens is also subject to federal regulation as to such matters as the maintenance of required reserves against deposits, limitations in connection with affiliate transactions, limitations as to the nature and amount of its loans and investments, regulatory approval of any merger or consolidation, issuance or retirement by Citizens of its own securities and other aspects of banking operations. In addition, the activities and operations of Citizens are subject to a number of additional detailed, complex and sometimes overlapping laws and regulations. These include state usury and consumer credit laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-redlining legislation and antitrust laws.

&#160;

Congress regularly considers legislation that may have an impact upon the operation of the Company and Citizens. At this time, the Company is unable to predict whether any proposed legislation will be enacted and, therefore, is unable to predict the impact such legislation may have on the operations of the Company.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

The Company itself, as a holding company, has no compensated employees. Citizens has 111 full time employees, with 35 of these serving in a management capacity, and 29 part time employees.

C Risk Elements &#160;

1. Nonaccrual, Past Due, Restructured and Impaired Loans &#160;

The following schedule summarizes nonaccrual loans, accruing loans which are contractually 90 days or more past due, and impaired loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; &#160; (In thousands) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Nonaccrual basis &#160; $ 1,044 &#160; &#160; $ 958 &#160; &#160; $ 2,880 &#160; &#160; $ 3,260 &#160; &#160; $ 4,855 &#160; Accruing loans 90 days or greater past due &#160; &#160; 132 &#160; &#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; &#160; 189 &#160; &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; Impaired loans &#160; &#160; 1,410 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,868 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,330 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,958 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8,891 &#160; Impaired loan with related allowance for unconfirmed losses &#160; &#160; 822 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,067 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,306 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,051 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,554 &#160; Impaired loan without related allowance for unconfirmed losses &#160; &#160; 588 &#160; &#160; &#160; 801 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,024 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,907 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,337 &#160; Troubled debt restructings &#160; &#160; 102 &#160; &#160; &#160; 155 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,243 &#160; &#160; &#160; 854 &#160; &#160; &#160; 466 &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The additional amount of interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, had they been current, totaled approximately $221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to generally not allow loans greater than 90 days past due to accrue interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Interest income is not reported when full loan repayment is doubtful, typically when the loan is impaired. Payments received on such loans are reported as principal reductions.

&#160; 

2. Potential Problem Loans &#160; 

The Company had no potential problem loans as of December 31, 2015 which have not been disclosed in Table C 1., but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans into one of the problem loan categories. 

&#160;

IV Summary of Loan Loss Experience

&#160;

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs less recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required based on past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management&#8217;s judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. The Company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with ASC 310-10-35-16, &#8220;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.&#8221; ASC 310-10-35-16 requires that impaired loans be measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate or, as an alternative, at the loan&#8217;s observable market price or fair value of the collateral. A loan is defined under ASC 310-10-35-16 as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. In applying the provisions of ASC 310-10-35-16, the Company considers its investment in one-to-four family residential loans and consumer installment loans to be homogenous and therefore excluded from separate identification for evaluation of impairment. With respect to the Company&#8217;s investment in nonresidential and multi-family residential real estate loans, and its evaluation of impairment thereof, such loans are generally collateral dependent and, as a result, are carried as a practical expedient at the fair value of the collateral.

&#160;

Collateral dependent loans which are more than ninety days delinquent are considered to constitute more than a minimum delay in repayment and are evaluated for impairment under ASC 310-10-35-16 at that time. 

For additional explanation of factors which influence management&#8217;s judgment in determining amounts charged to expense, refer to pages 13,14,15 and 16 of the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8221; and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in our 2015 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
