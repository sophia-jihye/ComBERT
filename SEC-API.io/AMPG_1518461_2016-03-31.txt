 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; Business Overview &#160;

We design, engineer and assemble micro-wave component based amplifiers that meet individual customer specifications. Our products consists of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on a time plus material basis. 

&#160;

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. From inception until August 2012, we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and acquire a target company or business that seeks to be a publicly held corporation. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization and development of our business plan.

Our Products 

&#160;

Our products consist of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. 

&#160;

New to our list of products is the 18 to 40 GHz wide band low noise amplifier. It is designed mainly for wideband telecommunications such as military and space applications, point to point radios as well as test equipment. 

&#160;

Low Noise Amplifiers 

&#160;

Low Noise Amplifiers, or LNAs, are amplifiers used in receivers of almost every type of communication system (Wi-Fi, Radar, Satellite, Base station, Cell phone, Radio, etc.) to improve signal strength and increase sensitivity and range of receivers. 

&#160; Medium Power Amplifiers 

&#160;

Medium Power Amplifers, or MPAs, provide increased output power and gain in transceiver chains to increase signal power and maintain dynamic range and linearity in Radars, Base-stations, Wireless networks, and almost every communication system. 

&#160;

Oscillators 

&#160;

Phase Locked Oscillators, or PLOs, and Dielectric Resonator Oscillators, or DROs, are ultra-stable frequency sources and references in transceiver applications that complement the amplifier chain in the transceivers. &#160;

Filters 

&#160;

Filters discriminate or block out certain frequencies in communication systems to improve dynamic range and NF response. Our filters are low loss and used on the front-end of the receiver chain that provide low degradation in the NF of the system, thereby maintaining and enhancing the signal clarity.

Our Technology 

&#160;

Our products are supported byhybrid design topologies that create highly linear Radio Frequency (RF) products that amplify and transform signals with minimal addition of noise, achieving high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and increased receiver sensitivity and range, at a low cost and low power consumption. Our hybrid design topologies include: 

&#160;

&#160;
