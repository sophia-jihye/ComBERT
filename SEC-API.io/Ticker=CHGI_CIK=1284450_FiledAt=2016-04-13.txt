 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the manufacturing of graphene, graphene oxide and graphite bipolar plates products in the PRC. We also operate a business-to-business and business-to-consumers Internet portal (www.roycarbon.com) for graphite related products. Vendors can sell raw materials, industrial commodities and consumer (household) commodities to both business and consumers through the website by paying a fee for each transaction conducted through the website. 

&#160; 

Our business scope includes manufacturing and selling primarily the following types of graphite products: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; graphene; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; graphene oxide; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; graphite bipolar plates &#160; 

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Some of our future business plans, including promoting our online portal and potential acquisition and merger, would likely require us to obtain additional funds from equity or debt markets, or to borrow additional funds from local banks. We currently have no commitments from any financing sources. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any funds on terms favorable to us, or at all. In the event that we issue shares of equity or convertible securities, holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage and integrate the production and sale of new products. 

&#160; 

Organizational Structure 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Nevada on February 13, 2003 as Achievers Magazine Inc. On December 17, 2007, we completed a reverse merger with Talent International Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on February 1, 2007 (&#8220;Talent&#8221;). Following the reverse merger, our name was changed to &#8220;China Carbon Graphite Group, Inc.&#8221;

&#160; 

As a result of the reverse merger, Talent became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Talent wholly owns Yongle, which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC. On December 14, 2007, Yongle executed a series of exclusive contractual agreements with Xingyong, an operating company organized under the laws of the PRC. Xingyong was founded in 1986 as a state-owned company and converted into a private enterprise in 2001. 

&#160; 

PRC law currently has limits on foreign ownership of certain companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operated our businesses in the PRC through Xingyong. Xingyong has the licenses and approvals necessary to operate in the PRC. We had contractual agreements with Xingyong and its stockholders pursuant to which we had the ability to substantially influence Xingyong&#8217;s daily operations and financial affairs, appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring stockholder approval. As a result of our contractual agreements with Xingyong, we were able to control Xingyong. Consequently, we consolidated Xingyong&#8217;s financial statements with our financial statements. 

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Xingyong&#8217;s principal stockholder and chief executive officer is Mr. Denyong Jin, our former chief executive officer and General Manager of our China operations. Mr. Dengyong Jin owns 1,000,000 shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015. Members of Mr. Jin&#8217;s family have control of Sincere Investment (PTC), Ltd. (&#8220;Sincere&#8221;), which owns approximately 27.88% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the contractual agreements between Yongle and Xingyong, Xingyong agreed to the following: 

&#160; 

Exclusive Technical Consulting and Services Agreement. Pursuant to the technical consulting and services agreement entered into on December 7, 2007 between Yongle and Xingyong, Yongle has agreed to provide technical and consulting services related to the business operations of Xingyong. As consideration for such services, Xingyong has agreed to pay to Yongle a service fee equal to 80% to 100% of the profits of Xingyong. The exact fee is calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, and is determined based on a number of factors, including but not limited to the complexity of the services provided and the commercial value of the services provided. The term of the exclusive technical consulting and services agreement is 10 years from the date thereof. Yongle may extend the term of such agreement. The parties may terminate the agreement, prior to its expiration, upon the mutual consent of Yongle and Xingyong. 

&#160; 

Business Operations Agreement. Pursuant to the business operations agreement entered into on December 7, 2007 between Yongle, Xingyong, and the shareholders of Xingyong, Xingyong has agreed not to conduct any material transaction or corporate action without obtaining the prior written consent of Yongle. Furthermore, Xingyong and its shareholders have agreed to implement proposals made by Yongle with respect to the operations of Xingyong&#8217;s business and the appointment of directors and officers of Xingyong. Yongle may terminate the business operations agreement at any time. The term of the business operations agreement is indefinite. 

&#160; 

Option Agreement. Yongle entered into an option agreement on December 7, 2007 with each of the shareholders of Xingyong, as well as Xingyong itself, pursuant to which Yongle has an exclusive option to purchase, or to designate another qualified person to purchase, to the extent permitted by PRC law and foreign investment policies, part or all of the equity interests in Xingyong owned by the shareholders of Xingyong. To the extent permitted by the PRC laws, the purchase price for the entire equity interest shall equal the actual price designated by Yongle to the extent permitted by relevant laws and regulations. The option agreement has a ten (10) year term. Upon the request of Yongle, the parties shall extend the term of the option agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Equity Pledge Agreement. Pursuant to an equity pledge agreement, dated December 7, 2007, each of the shareholders of Xingyong pledged his equity interest in Xingyong to Yongle to secure Xingyong&#8217;s obligations under the VIE agreements described above. In addition, the shareholders of Xingyong agreed not to transfer, sell, pledge, dispose of or create any encumbrance on any equity interests in Xingyong that would affect Yongle&#8217;s interests. The equity pledge agreement will expire when Xingyong fully performs its obligations under the various VIE agreements described above. 

&#160; 

Sale of Yongle. On June 10, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Yongle (together with the Company, the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;), and Dengyong Jin and Benhua Du (collectively &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchasers purchased all of the rights and obligations of Yongle under the Contractual Arrangements. The Purchasers collectively hold 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Xingyong. The purchase price under the Agreement is $1,543,734 (RMB 10 million), including $575,813 (RMB 3.73 million) in cash and the cancellation of the registrant&#8217;s repayment obligations of $967,921 (RMB 6.27 million) previously advanced by Dengyong Jin to the Company. The disposal of Xingyong became effective on June 30, 2014 after approved by majority of shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders held on such date. In connection with this transaction and as of December 31, 2015, Company has not received the $1,543,734 of the total purchase price and adjusted the note receivable as a bad debt expense. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s results of operations related to Xingyong have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. 

&#160; 

Acquisition in December 2013 

&#160; 

On December 23, 2013, we acquired Golden Ivy Limited, a British Virgin Island company (&#8220;BVI Co.,&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, we will issue an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to the former shareholders of BVI Co. in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of BVI Co. BVI Co. then became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The shares were issued on January 16, 2014.

&#160; 

BVI Co. currently has two business operations as follows (collectively the &#8220;Business&#8221;): 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Manufacturing of Graphene Oxide and graphite bipolar plates. Graphene Oxide has wide applications as a conductive agent, such as in lithium ion batteries, super capacitors, rubber and plastic additives, conductive ink, special coating, transparent conductive thin films and chips. Graphite bipolar plates are primarily used in solar power storage. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; A business-to-business and business-to-consumers Internet portal (www.roycarbon.com) for graphite related products. Vendors can sell raw materials, industrial commodities and consumer (household) commodities to both business and consumers through the website by paying a fee for each transaction conducted through the website. &#160; 

The Business and the facilities related thereto are all located in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;China&#8221;). The Business is conducted by Royal Elite New Energy Science and Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Royal Shanghai&#8221;), a wholly foreign owned enterprise under laws of China. Royal Shanghai is wholly owned by Royal Elite International Limited, a Hong Kong company, (&#8220;Royal HK&#8221;), which is wholly owned by BVI Co. The Business currently generates minimal sales. 

&#160; 

Royal Shanghai was set up in Shanghai on June 9, 2010. Royal HK was set up in Hong Kong on January 8, 2010.

Organizational Structure Chart 

&#160; 

The following chart sets forth our organizational structure: 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

Through our newly acquired subsidiary we now manufacture and sell the following products: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; grapheme; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; graphene oxide; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; graphite bipolar plates. &#160; 

Graphene Oxide has wide applications as a conductive agent, such as in lithium ion batteries, super capacitors, rubber and plastic additives, conductive ink, special coating, transparent conductive thin films and chips. 

&#160; 

Graphite bipolar plates are primarily used in solar power storage. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers include mainly international customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers. Our customers generally purchase our products pursuant to purchase orders. 

&#160; 

Our Sales and Marketing Efforts 

&#160; 

We have not spent a significant amount of capital on advertising. 

&#160; 

Competition and Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We compete with a large number of domestic and international companies that manufacture graphene and grapheme related products. Because of the nature of the products that we sell, we believe that the reputation of the manufacturer and the quality of the product may be as important as price. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Statutory Reserve 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2013, the Company acquired new operations carried through BVI Co., and its subsidiaries Royal HK and Royal Shanghai. All of the cash generated by our operations has been held by our China entities. In order to transfer such cash to our parent entity, China Carbon Graphite Group, Inc., which is a Nevada Corporation, we would need to rely on dividends, loans or advances made by our PRC subsidiaries or VIE entity. Such transfers may be subject to certain regulations or risks. To date, our parent entity has paid its expenses by raising capital through private placement transactions. In the future, in the event that our parent entity is unable to raise needed funds from private investors, Royal Shanghai would have to transfer funds to our parent entity through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Royal HK and BVI Co. 

&#160; 

PRC regulations relating to statutory reserves and currency conversion would impact our ability to transfer cash within our corporate structure. The Company Law of the PRC applicable to Chinese companies provides that net after tax income should be allocated by the following rules: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. 10% of after tax income to be allocated to a statutory surplus reserve until the reserve amounts to 50% of the company&#8217;s registered capital. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. If the accumulate balance of statutory surplus reserve is not enough to make up the Company&#8217;s cumulative prior years&#8217; losses, the current year&#8217;s after tax income should be first used to make up the losses before the statutory surplus reverse is drawn. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Allocation can be made to the discretionary surplus reserve, if such a reserve is approved at the meeting of the equity owners. &#160; 

Therefore, the Company is required to maintain a statutory reserve in China that limits any equity distributions to its shareholders. The maximum amount of the shareholders has not been reached. The company has never distributed earnings to shareholders and has consistently stated in the Company&#8217;s filings it has no intentions to do so. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The RMB cannot be freely exchanged into Dollars. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (&#8220;SAFE&#8221;) administers foreign exchange dealings and requires that they be conducted though designated financial institutions. Foreign Investment Enterprises, such as Royal Shanghai, may purchase foreign currency from designated financial institutions in connection with current account transactions, including profit repatriation. 

&#160; 

These factors will limit the amount of funds that we can transfer from Royal Shanghai to our parent entity and may delay any such transfer. In addition, upon repatriation of earnings of Royal Shanghai to the United States, those earnings may become subject to United States federal and state income taxes. We have not accrued any U.S. federal or state tax liability on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary because those funds are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. Accordingly, taxes imposed upon repatriation of those earnings to the U.S. would reduce the net worth of the Company. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Circular 106 Compliance and Approval 

&#160; 

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (&#8220;SAFE&#8221;) issued an official notice known as &#8220;Circular 106,&#8221; which requires the owners of any Chinese company to obtain SAFE&#8217;s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure to facilitate foreign financing or subsequent acquisitions in China. We believe that our wholly-owned subsidiaries Talent and BVI. Co. were not required to obtain SAFE&#8217;s approval to establish its offshore companies Yongle and Royal HK as &#8220;special purpose vehicle&#8221; for capital raising activities on behalf of Royal Shanghai because of offshore structure. 

&#160; 

Restrictions on Exports of Natural Resources 

&#160; 

In 2010, the Chinese government decided to implement a number of new restrictions on natural resource industry sectors. As a result, domestic Chinese companies in certain natural resource industries face export restrictions. Such restrictions may limit our ability to export our products in the future, or may increase the expense of our exports, which may impact our business. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 7 full-time employees.
