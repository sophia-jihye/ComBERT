Our foreign banking activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant. 

Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. For each of our five business segments, we expect the combination of our business model and exceptional service to provide a competitive advantage that supports revenue and earnings growth. Our business model emphasizes the delivery of a complete set of banking products and services offered by larger banks, but distinguished by local delivery and customer service. 

A key strategic emphasis has been for our business segments to operate in cooperation to provide products and services to our customers and to build stronger and more profitable relationships using our OCR sales and service process. The objectives of OCR are to: 

1. Provide a consultative sales approach to provide solutions that are specific to each customer. 

2. Leverage each business segment in terms of its products and expertise to benefit customers. 

3. Target prospects who may want to have multiple products and services as part of their relationship with us. 

Following is a description of our five business segments and a Treasury / Other function: 

&#8226; 

Retail and Business Banking &#32;&#8211; The Retail and Business Banking segment provides a wide array of financial products and services to consumer and small business customers including but not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, consumer loans, and small business loans. Other financial services available to consumer and small business customers include investments, insurance, interest rate risk protection, foreign exchange, and treasury management. Huntington serves customers primarily through our network of branches in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky. In addition to our extensive branch network, customers can access Huntington through online banking, mobile banking, telephone banking, and ATMs. 

Huntington has established a "Fair Play" banking philosophy; providing differentiated products and services, built on a strong foundation of customer advocacy. Our brand resonates with consumers and is earning us more new customers and deeper relationships with our current customers. 

Business Banking is a dynamic part of our business and we are committed to being the bank of choice for small businesses in our markets. Business Banking is defined as serving companies with revenues up to $20 million and consists of approximately 165,000 businesses. Huntington continues to develop products and services that are designed specifically to meet the needs of small business and look for ways to help companies find solutions to their financing needs. 

&#8226; 

Commercial Banking : Through a relationship banking model, this segment provides a wide array of products and services to the middle market, large corporate, and government public sector customers located primarily within our geographic footprint. The segment is divided into seven business units: middle market, large corporate, specialty banking, asset finance, capital markets, treasury management, and insurance. 

Middle Market Banking primarily focuses on providing banking solutions to companies with annual revenues of $20 million to $500 million. Through a relationship management approach, various products, capabilities and solutions are seamlessly delivered in a client centric way. 

Corporate Banking works with larger, often more complex companies with revenues greater than $500 million. These entities, many of which are publicly traded, require a different and customized approach to their banking needs. 

Specialty Banking offers tailored products and services to select industries that have a foothold in the Midwest. Each banking team is comprised of industry experts with a dynamic understanding of the market and industry. Many of these industries are experiencing tremendous change, which creates opportunities for Huntington to leverage our expertise and help clients navigate, adapt, and succeed. 

Asset Finance business is a combination of our Equipment Finance, Public Capital, Asset Based Lending, Technology and Healthcare Equipment Leasing, and Lender Finance divisions that focus on providing financing solutions against these respective asset classes. 

Capital Markets has two distinct product capabilities: corporate risk management services and institutional sales, trading, and underwriting. The Capital Markets Group offers a full suite of risk management tools including commodities, foreign exchange, and interest rate hedging services. The Institutional Sales, Trading &#38; Underwriting team provides access to capital and investment solutions for both municipal and corporate institutions. 

Treasury Management teams help businesses manage their working capital programs and reduce expenses. Our liquidity solutions help customers save and invest wisely, while our payables and receivables capabilities help them manage purchases and the receipt of payments for goods and services. All of this is provided while helping customers take a sophisticated approach to managing their overhead, inventory, equipment, and labor. 

Insurance brokerage business specializes in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, personal lines, life and disability and specialty lines of insurance. The group also provides brokerage and agency services for residential and commercial title insurance and excess and surplus product lines of insurance. As an agent and broker, this business does not assume underwriting risks but alternatively provides our customers with quality, noninvestment insurance contracts. 

&#8226; 

Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate: &#32;This segment provides lending and other banking products and services to customers outside of our traditional retail and commercial banking segments. Our products and services include providing financing for the purchase of vehicles by customers at franchised automotive dealerships, financing the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventory of franchised automotive dealerships, and financing for land, buildings, and other commercial real estate owned or constructed by real estate developers, automobile dealerships, or other customers with real estate project financing needs. Products and services are delivered through highly specialized relationship-focused bankers and product partners. Huntington creates well-defined relationship plans which identify needs where solutions are developed and customer commitments are obtained. 

The Automotive Finance team services automobile dealerships, its owners, and consumers buying automobiles through these franchised dealerships. Huntington has provided new and used automobile financing and dealer services throughout the Midwest since the early 1950s. This consistency in the market and our focus on working with strong dealerships has allowed us to expand into selected markets outside of the Midwest and to actively deepen relationships while building a strong reputation. 

The Commercial Real Estate team serves real estate developers, REITs, and other customers with lending needs that are secured by commercial properties. Most of these customers are located within our footprint. 

Within Commercial Real Estate, Huntington Community Development focuses on improving the quality of life for our communities and the residents of low-to moderate-income neighborhoods by developing and delivering innovative products and services to support affordable housing and neighborhood stabilization. 

&#8226; 

Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group: Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group is well positioned competitively as we have closely aligned with our eleven regional banking markets. A fundamental point of differentiation is our commitment to be actively engaged within our local markets - building 

connections with community and business leaders and offering a uniquely personal experience delivered by colleagues working within those markets. 

The Huntington Private Client Group is organized into units consisting of The Huntington Private Bank, The Huntington Trust, and The Huntington Investment Company. Our private banking, trust, and investment functions focus their efforts in our Midwest footprint and Florida. 

The Huntington Private Bank provides high net-worth customers with deposit, lending (including specialized lending options), and banking services. 

The Huntington Trust also serves high net-worth customers and delivers wealth management and legacy planning through investment and portfolio management, fiduciary administration, trust services, and trust operations. This group also provides retirement plan services and corporate trust to businesses and municipalities. 

The Huntington Investment Company, a dually registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser, employs representatives who work with our Retail and Private Bank to provide investment solutions for our customers. This team offers a wide range of products and services, including brokerage, annuities, advisory, and other investment products. 

Huntington sold HAA, HASI, and Unified in the 2015 fourth quarter. 

&#8226; 

Home Lending: &#32;Home Lending originates and services consumer loans and mortgages for customers who are generally located in our primary banking markets. Consumer and mortgage lending products are primarily distributed through the Retail and Business Banking segment, as well as through commissioned loan originators. Home Lending earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, earns fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage loans, and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. Home Lending supports the origination and servicing of mortgage loans across all segments. 

The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. 

The financial results for each of these business segments are included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are discussed in the Business Segment Discussion of our MD&#38;A. 

Pending Acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation 

On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction expected to be valued at approximately $3.4 billion based on the closing stock price on the day preceding the announcement. FirstMerit Corporation is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, which reported assets of approximately $25.5 billion based on their December 31, 2015 unaudited balance sheet, and 366 banking offices and 400 ATM locations in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. First Merit Corporation provides a complete range of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its core operations. Principal affiliates include: FirstMerit Bank, N.A. and First Merit Mortgage Corporation. 

Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit Corporation will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of FirstMerit Corporation common stock. The transaction is expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation. 

Competition 

We compete with other banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, and finance and trust companies, as well as mortgage banking companies, automobile and equipment financing companies (including captive automobile finance companies), insurance companies, mutual funds, investment advisors, and brokerage firms, both within and outside of our primary market areas. Internet companies are also providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong, competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers. 

We compete for loans primarily on the basis of a combination of value and service by building customer relationships as a result of addressing our customers&#8217; entire suite of banking needs, demonstrating expertise, and providing convenience to our customers. We also consider the competitive pricing pressures in each of our markets. 

We compete for deposits similarly on a basis of a combination of value and service and by providing convenience through a banking network of branches and ATMs within our markets and our website at www.huntington.com. We have also instituted 

customer friendly practices, such as our 24-Hour Grace &#174; &#32;account feature, which gives customers an additional business day to cover overdrafts to their consumer account without being charged overdraft fees.

Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery systems, consolidation among financial service providers, bank failures, and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies. 

Financial Technology, or FinTech, startups are emerging in key areas of banking. In response, we are monitoring activity in marketplace lending along with businesses engaged in money transfer, investment advice, and money management tools. Our strategy involves assessing the marketplace, determining our near term plan, while developing a longer term approach to effectively service our existing customers and attract new customers. This includes evaluating which products we develop in-house, as well as evaluating partnership options where applicable. 

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB, and other federal and state regulators. 

Because we are a public company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC. The SEC has established five categories of issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a large accelerated filer and, as such, must comply with SEC accelerated reporting requirements. 

The banking industry is highly regulated. We and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations that govern many aspects of our operations and limit the businesses in which we may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund, the stability of the financial system in the United States, and the health of the national economy, and are not designed primarily to benefit or protect our shareholders or creditors. 

The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of the activities regulated by the banking laws and regulations applicable to us or our Bank or the impact of such laws and regulations on us or the Bank. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their interpretation and application by the bank regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results. 

We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve and qualify for and have elected to become a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLBA"). We are subject to examination, regulation, and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve. 

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of 

non-depository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institution(s). The ratings assigned to us, like those assigned to other financial institutions, are confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the extent required by law. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion, we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards. As a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable to smaller institutions, including with respect to capital requirements, leverage limits, and stress testing. The Federal Reserve has issued supervisory guidance which sets forth an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large financial institutions, including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The objectives of the framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm, lower the probability of its failure, and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institution&#8217;s failure. With regard to resiliency, each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated organization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses. This requires financial resilience by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity, and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance, risk management, and recovery planning. With respect to lowering the probability of failure, each firm is expected to ensure the sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses. This requires, among other things, that we have robust, forward-looking capital-planning processes that account for our unique risks. 

The Bank, which is chartered by the OCC, is a national bank and our only bank subsidiary. It is subject to comprehensive examination, regulation and supervision primarily by the OCC and, with respect to Federal consumer protection laws, by the CFPB, which was established by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to certain rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. As a FDIC member, the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments payable to the Deposit Insurance Fund and various FDIC requirements. The National Bank Act and the OCC regulations primarily govern the Bank&#8217;s permissible activities, capital requirements, branching, dividend limitations, investments, loans, and other matters. Our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve or, in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. All subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the CFPB to the extent they offer any consumer financial products or services. Our subsidiaries may be subject to examination by other federal and state regulators, including, in the case of certain securities and investment management activities, regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 

In September 2014, the OCC published final guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including national banks with $50 billion or more in average total consolidated assets, such as the Bank. The guidelines became effective November 10, 2014, and require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. Given its size and the phased implementation schedule, the Bank is subject to these heightened standards effective May 2016. As discussed in Item 1A: Risk Factors, the Bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls. 

Legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry. 

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions, and restricted certain proprietary trading, and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations, many of which have not yet been issued. The regulations will continue to take effect over several more years, continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us, our customers, or the financial industry in general. 

On October 3, 2015, the CFPB&#8217;s final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act became effective. On January 1, 2016, most requirements of the OCC&#8217;s Final Rule in Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards (the Flood Final Rule) became effective, including the requirement that flood insurance premiums and fees for most mortgage loans be escrowed subject to certain exceptions. The Flood Final Rule also incorporated other existing flood insurance requirements and exceptions (e.g. the exemption from flood insurance requirements for non-residential detached structures - a discretionary item) with those portions of the Flood Final Rule becoming effective on October 1, 2015. We continue to monitor, evaluate, and implement these new regulations. 

Throughout 2015, the CFPB continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders. This focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the CFPB and Department of Justice. Indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the CFPB to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers. Finally, the CFPB has implemented its 

larger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger non-bank indirect automobile lenders under CFPB supervision. 

Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP) by banks under standards developed many years ago by the Federal Trade Commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave to the CFPB similar authority to take action in connection with unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) by entities subject to CFPB supervisory or enforcement authority. Banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of &#8220;abusive&#8221; practices. 

Financial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new Military Lending Act (MLA) final rules issued by the Department of Defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after October 3, 2016. The new rules dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the MLA and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial services companies than under the previous rules. 

On July 10, 2015, the Federal Communication Commission, interpreting the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, issued an Omnibus Declaratory Ruling and Order that, among other things, restricted the use of automated telephone dialing machines. The ruling effectively increases the cost of collecting debts as well as increases the litigation risk associated with the use of auto-dialers. 

Large bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve and OCC, respectively, and conduct stress tests. 

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis and requires such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve under certain circumstances before making a capital distribution. This rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets. 

A large bank holding company&#8217;s capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at least the next nine quarters, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a detailed description of the entity&#8217;s process for assessing capital adequacy, the entity&#8217;s capital policy, and a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding company&#8217;s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s capital adequacy or liquidity. The planning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in January 2015. Rules to implement the Basel III capital reforms in the United States were finalized in July 2013 and are being phased-in by us beginning with 1Q 2015 results under the standardized approach. Capital adequacy at large banking organizations, including us, is assessed against a minimum 4.5% CET1 ratio and a 4% tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the Federal Reserve. 

Capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2016, and the Federal Reserve will either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice of non-objection, no later than June 30, 2016. We intend to submit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2016. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stress test and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. 

In addition to the CCAR submission, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that national banks, like The Huntington National Bank, conduct annual stress tests for submission beginning in January 2015. The results of the stress tests will provide the OCC with forward-looking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a company&#8217;s risk profile and capital adequacy. We submitted our stress test results to the OCC in January 2015. We intend to submit our 2016 capital plan to the OCC on or before April 5, 2016. 

The regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders&#8217; equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the ratio of common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital in accordance with their requirements. 

Conforming Covered Activities to implement the Volcker Rule. 

On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and established July 21, 2015, as the end of the conformance period. Section 619 generally prohibits an insured depository institution, any company that controls an insured depository institution (such 

as a bank holding company), and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "banking entities") from engaging in short-term proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund ("covered funds"). These prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, restrictions, and definitions. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced it acted under Section 619 to give banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (&#8220;legacy covered funds&#8221;). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to act this year to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds. The Bank continues its &#8220;good faith&#8221; efforts to conform with proprietary trading prohibitions and associated compliance requirements. The Company does not expect Volcker compliance to have a material impact on its business model. 

The Volcker Rule's prohibitions impact the ability of U.S. banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with non-U.S. banking organizations in overseas markets. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading. 

The final Volcker Rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting, market-making, and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations, as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of &#8220;covered funds&#8221;. The level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading. CEOs of larger banking entities, including Huntington, have to attest annually in writing that their organization has in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test, and modify compliance with the Volcker Rule regulations. Banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information, beginning between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2016, depending on the size of the banking entity&#8217;s trading assets and liabilities. 

On January 14, 2014, the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the Volcker Rule. Under the interim final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met. In addition, the agencies released a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule. At December 31, 2015, we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities. Seven of our pools are included in the list of non-exclusive issuers. We have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final Volcker Rule regulations. 

There are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. 

Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the holding company. Regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or common stock. The Bank is currently able to pay dividends to the holding company subject to these limitations. 

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Depending on the financial condition of the Bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay dividends to the holding company. 

The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may prohibit or limit bank holding companies from making capital distributions, including payment of preferred and common dividends, as part of the annual capital plan approval process. 

We are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the Federal Reserve and Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks. 

The Federal Reserve sets risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio represents total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements. 

In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted final capital rules implementing Basel III requirements for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. These new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. 

The following are the Basel III regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period, from January 1, 2015, until January 1, 2019:

The final rule emphasizes CET1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital, and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rule also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. Banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets. 

Based on the final Basel III rule, banking organizations with more than $15 billion in total consolidated assets are required to phase-out of additional tier 1 capital any non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares) issued before September 12, 2010. We began the additional tier 1 capital phase-out of our trust preferred securities in 2015, but will be able to include these instruments in tier 2 capital as a non-advanced approaches institution. 

Under Basel III, CET1 predominantly includes common stockholders&#8217; equity, less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets net of related taxes, over-funded net pension fund assets, and DTAs that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards. We elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from CET1 as permitted in the final rule. Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 as well as perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests. Total capital predominantly includes tier 1 capital as well as certain long-term debt and allowance for credit losses qualifying for tier 2 capital. The calculations of CET1, tier 1 capital, and tier 2 capital include phase-out periods for certain instruments from January 2015 through December 2017. The primary items subject to the phase-out from capital for us are other intangible assets, DTAs that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards, and trust preferred securities. 

Risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach are generally based on supervisory risk weightings that vary only by counterparty type and asset class. The revisions to supervisory risk weightings for Basel III enhance risk sensitivity and include alternatives to the use of credit ratings when calculating the risk weight for certain assets. Specifically, Basel III includes a more risk-sensitive treatment for past due and nonaccrual loans, certain commercial loans, MSRs, and certain unfunded commitments. Basel III also prescribes a new formulaic approach for calculating the risk weight of securitization exposures that is also more risk sensitive. 

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under Prompt Corrective Action as applicable to under-capitalized institutions. 

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank&#8217;s capital due to changes in interest rates. These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management. 

FDICIA requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take Prompt Corrective Action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized. 

Throughout 2015, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions. An institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it meets or exceeds the well-capitalized minimums listed below, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would become under-capitalized after such payment. Under-capitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan. 

Depending upon the severity of the under capitalization, the under-capitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately-capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. Critically under-capitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified. 

Under FDICIA, a well-capitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. A depository institution that is not well-capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. Since the Bank is well-capitalized, the FDICIA brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $2.9 billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2015. 

On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the U.S. version of the Basel Committee's minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, and a less stringent modified LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario. We are covered by the modified LCR requirement and therefore subject to the initial phase-in of the rule beginning in January 2016, with the requirement fully phased-in January 2017. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly. The modified LCR is a minimum requirement, and the Federal Reserve can impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matter. 

We are required to submit annual resolution plans 

As a bank holding company with greater than $50 billion of assets, we are required annually to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company in the event of material financial distress or failure. If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that our plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose on us more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. 

The FDIC separately has adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank, to submit periodically to the FDIC a resolution plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure. The FDIC rule requires each covered institution to provide a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC as receiver to resolve the institution in an orderly manner that enables prompt access of insured deposits; maximizes the return from the failed institution&#8217;s assets; and minimizes losses realized by creditors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. 

We filed our resolution plans pursuant to each rule in December 2015. 

As a bank holding company, we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. It may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. 

Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, an appointed bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution&#8217;s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. 

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro-rata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in such national bank&#8217;s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro-rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions. 

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the holders of the institution&#8217;s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of such institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank. 

Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are restricted. 

Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank&#8217;s bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm&#8217;s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank&#8217;s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the bank holding company may be required to provide it. 

Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of (i) the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment advisor, (ii) credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions, and (iii) transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. They also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July 21, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them. 

As a financial holding company, we are subject to additional laws and regulations. 

As a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in, and affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and the Bank must each remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed.&#8221; In addition, the Bank must receive 

a Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") rating of at least &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; at its most recent examination for us to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies. Pursuant to CRA, the OCC examines the Bank to assess the Bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank and assigns a rating based on that assessment. The CRA assessment and rating is reviewed by the Federal Reserve in evaluating a variety of applications including to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of other institutions, or to open or relocate a branch office. 

Financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the Bank Holding Company Act or determined by the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity, provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. In addition, we are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act added a new provision to the Bank Holding Company Act, which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 

We also must comply with anti-money laundering and customer privacy regulations, as well as corporate governance, accounting, and reporting requirements. 

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has proposed a rule for those same entities, and, if adopted, the proposal will prescribe customer due diligence requirements, including a new regulatory mandate to identify the beneficial owners of legal entities which are customers. 

Pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are required to: 

&#8226; 

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices, 

&#8226; 

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties, and 

&#8226; 

give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to nonaffiliated third parties. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and reporting requirements on us. In addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify financial statements in writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters, the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider transactions, code of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 

The Federal Reserve, jointly with the OCC and FDIC, has issued guidance to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. In addition, the federal financial regulators issued a proposed rule in April 2011 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act to adopt standards for determining whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement may encourage inappropriate risk-taking that are consistent with the key principles established for incentive compensation in the guidance. The proposed rule would apply to financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets, with heightened standards for financial institutions with $50 billion or more in assets. The guidance from the regulators on compensation is still evolving.
