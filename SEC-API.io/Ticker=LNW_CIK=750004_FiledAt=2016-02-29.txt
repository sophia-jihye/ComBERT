 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise indicates, all references to the words "Scientific Games," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Scientific Games Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. "U.S. jurisdictions" refer to the 50 states in the U.S. plus the District of Columbia. 

General 

Scientific Games Corporation was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. We are a leading developer of technology&#8209;based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery and interactive gaming industries. Our portfolio includes gaming machines and game content, casino management systems, table game products and services, instant and draw&#8209;based lottery games, server&#8209;based gaming and lottery systems, sports betting technology, lottery content and services, loyalty and rewards programs, interactive gaming and social casino solutions. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments. As a result of our recent acquisitions of Bally and WMS, we have significantly expanded our global Gaming and Interactive gaming businesses. 

Impact of Recent Acquisitions 

On November 21, 2014, we acquired Bally for $5.1 billion (including the refinancing of approximately $1.9 billion of existing Bally indebtedness). On October 18, 2013, we acquired WMS for $1.5 billion. In connection with these acquisitions, we incurred additional indebtedness and completed a series of refinancing transactions, which are described in Note 15 (Long-Term and Other Debt). For additional information regarding the Bally acquisition and the WMS acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisitions and Dispositions). 

Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were significantly impacted by the inclusion of the results of operations of Bally in our Gaming and Interactive segments' results of operations and by higher interest expense associated with the additional indebtedness incurred to finance the Bally acquisition. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 include Bally only from the November 21, 2014 acquisition date and were also significantly impacted by the inclusion of the results of operations of WMS in our Gaming and Interactive segments' results of operations and by higher interest expense associated with the additional indebtedness incurred to finance the WMS acquisition. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include WMS only from the October 18, 2013 acquisition date. 

We remain focused on successfully integrating Bally and WMS and achieving anticipated cost synergies by implementing our plans to streamline our operations and cost structure. We are also focused on positioning the Company for profitable growth by leveraging our core strengths and capabilities to enhance our portfolio of products and services and to expand market penetration worldwide. We anticipate our future results of operations will benefit from these efforts, although we expect these benefits to be offset to some extent by certain one-time incremental operating costs and capital expenditures in 2016 related to our contemplated integration activities. We also expect to incur additional costs during 2016 in order to position ourselves to capitalize on longer-term synergy opportunities. 

Strategy 

Our vision is to empower our customers by creating the world&#8217;s best gaming and lottery experiences. With the broadest product portfolio in the industry, we strive to offer best-in-class products and services across all three of our business segments -- Gaming, Lottery and Interactive. 

To this end, we are focused on the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Focus on innovation &#8212; We place great emphasis on producing innovative and high-performing Gaming, Lottery and Interactive content, products and services that provide measurable value to our customers. Our goal is to create &#8220;must have&#8221; products and complete systems and services with unique features and functionality through our innovation-centric corporate culture. We seek to leverage our expansive content library and portfolio of proprietary and licensed intellectual property, and utilize our extensive player and customer research in order to bring innovation to our products, services and processes. Also, we intend to take advantage of our state-of-the-art operating system development and game development tools to enhance our ideation and development processes and generate greater efficiencies in game production. 

&#8226; 

Deepen customer-centric focus &#8212; We aim to meet the needs of our Gaming, Lottery and Interactive customers and their respective players with our expansive portfolio of Gaming, Lottery and Interactive products and services and use our extensive industry experience to provide the best solutions to our customers as their partner of choice. We place great emphasis on tailoring our extensive research and development activities to address our customers&#8217; needs and 

player preferences in meaningful ways. As we operate a significant portion of our business on a Participation basis, we will continue to focus on helping our customers grow their revenue. 

&#8226; 

Leverage our scale and scope to drive growth through nimble and flexible operations, customer service and cost synergies &#8212; We are one company with three business lines offering our customers around the globe the broadest and most comprehensive products and services in the industry. We plan to leverage our &#8220;Company of One&#8221; strategy in areas such as research and development, global sourcing, manufacturing and logistics in order to lower our cost, accelerate our speed to market and enhance customer satisfaction. We expect to continue achieve cost synergies through disciplined balance sheet management and the continued consolidation of our company policies, business platforms and facilities, as we improve our operations and business processes to be best-in-class. 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on growth opportunities &#8212; We seek to leverage our diversified portfolio of Gaming, Lottery and Interactive solutions, our broad international presence and our extensive business development and government relations capabilities to extend our Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming businesses to new jurisdictions and to expand our presence in existing jurisdictions. We plan to pursue opportunities to cross-sell and cross-utilize the combined company&#8217;s expansive portfolio of game content, intellectual property and licensed brands across multiple distribution channels in order to grow our revenue. With continued focus on growing recurring revenue, our goal is to attain global leadership in each of our business segments while selectively pursuing new verticals, strategic alliances and acquisitions. 

Segments 

We report our operations in three business segments (Gaming, Lottery and Interactive) representing our different products and services. See "Business Segment Results" below and Note 2 (Business Segments) for additional business segment information. 

Gaming Segment 

The gaming industry is a large and dynamic worldwide marketplace characterized by the rapid development of new technologies, products and game content. Gaming products and services are used by a diverse group of gaming operators, including commercial and tribal casinos, riverboat casinos, horse and greyhound racetracks, bars, Jai Alai facilities, truck stops, night clubs, bingo and arcade halls, LBOs and similar venues. In addition, U.S. and international lotteries may offer VLTs and other forms of gaming, such as bingo and sports wagering. 

Our products are installed in all of the major regulated gaming jurisdictions in the U.S., as well as in approximately 146 international gaming jurisdictions. We believe the total installed base of gaming machines in North America is approximately 975,000 units and has been relatively stable in recent years. Growth of gaming in land-based venues is driven by the opening of new casinos in both new and existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos. In addition, the land-based gaming supply business is significantly impacted by the rate at which casinos and other gaming operators replace their gaming machines, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including their capital budgets. Virtually all sectors of the gaming industry are impacted by changes in economic conditions that impact players&#8217; disposable incomes. 

The following table summarizes the primary business activities and investments included in our Gaming business segment. 

&#160; 

Primary Business Activities 

&#160; 

Equity Investments

&#160; 

The types of products and services from which our Gaming segment derives its revenues are further discussed in Note 1 (Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating (loss) income and total assets for the last three fiscal years and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas, is included in Note 2 (Business Segments). Additional information regarding our equity investments in the Gaming segment is included in Note 11 (Equity Investments). 

Product sales 

Our product sales include the sale of gaming machines, casino-management technology solutions and systems and table products to commercial, tribal and government casino operators and wide-area gaming operators as well as sales of conversion kits (including game, hardware or operating system conversions), spare parts and game content. 

&#8226; 

Gaming machines: &#32;The majority of our product sales are derived from sales of gaming machines and VLTs that utilize a combination of advanced graphics, mechanical reels, digital music and sound effects and secondary bonus games. Our Pro Series TM , Blade &#174; and TwinStar TM &#32; branded cabinets are currently available in upright, slant, curve and other models, including the Pro Wave &#174; &#32; cabinet with a unique 40-inch curved touchscreen monitor, the Pro Jumbo V55 TM cabinet measuring over nine feet tall and featuring a 55-inch widescreen vertical monitor and our Dualos TM and Equinox &#174; &#32;branded cabinets. We also sell electronic table systems ("ETS") to either suit the needs of particular locations where live tables are not allowed or as productivity-enhancing solutions for other jurisdictions. Our ETS suite of products provides numerous efficiencies and benefits to casinos including reduced downtime, virtual elimination of errors, miss-pays and cheating and automated reporting such as wagering statistics and player tracking. Some of our ETS products enable us to offer table game content where live table games are not permitted, such as racinos (establishments that offer casino gaming in addition to race betting) and locations that provide VLTs. 

&#8226; 

Casino-management technology solutions and systems: We offer core slot, casino and table-management systems (collectively, "casino-management systems") that help our customers improve communication with players, add excitement to the gaming floor and enhance operating efficiencies through greater automation, reporting and business intelligence. Our comprehensive suite of technology solutions provides gaming operations of every size with a wide range of marketing, data management and analysis, accounting, player tracking, security and other applications and tools to more effectively manage their operations. We also provide technologies for deployment of networked, server-based gaming environments, with centralized management and control. 

&#8226; 

Table products: Our table products sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to enhance table game speed, productivity, profitability and security. Our product offerings include various models of automatic card shufflers to suit specific games, as well as deck checkers and roulette chip sorters. 

Our card-reading shoes gather data and enable casinos to track table-game play and our baccarat viewer displays current game results and trends. Our roulette chip sorters efficiently count and organize chips for roulette table games. Our Shuffler products are intended to cost-effectively provide increased game speed and data on table-game play for security and marketing purposes, which in turn allows our customers to increase their profitability. Less frequently, we will sell a perpetual license to one of our proprietary table games for use on a casino floor. 

&#8226; 

Parts sales, conversion kits, used gaming machines and game content: We sell replacement parts, operating systems and content conversion kits for our gaming machines and, less frequently, used gaming machines and hardware. 

Services 

Our services revenue includes revenue earned from Participation games, other gaming machine services and table product leasing and licensing. We categorize our Participation gaming machines as (1) WAP, premium and daily fee Participation games and (2) other leased and Participation games. 

WAP, premium and daily fee Participation games 

&#8226; 

WAP Participation games: &#32;WAP Participation games are electronically linked gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a single gaming jurisdiction or across Native American gaming jurisdictions. Players across linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for system-wide progressive jackpots that are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non-WAP gaming machine. We are responsible for funding WAP jackpots. We create WAP games using our proprietary brands and also using licensed brands. Our licensed brands include, among others; MONOPOLY&#8482;, THE WIZARD OF OZ&#8482;, SPIDER-MAN&#8482;, THE LORD OF THE RINGS&#8482; , &#32;JAMES CAMERON&#8217;S TITANIC&#8482; , MICHAEL JACKSON KING OF POP&#8482;, MICHAEL JACKSON WANNA BE STARTIN&#8217; SOMETHIN&#8217;&#8482;, FRIENDS&#8482;, DUCK DYNASTY&#8482;, AUSTIN POWERS&#8482;, IRON MAN&#8482;, ELVIS TM , THE FLINTSTONES TM , WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY&#8482;, THE JETSONS TM &#32; and GREMLINS TM . &#32;We operate our WAP systems in six states throughout the United States as well as in certain Native American casinos. 

Premium and daily fee Participation games: &#32;We offer two categories of non-WAP premium and daily fee Participation games: LAP and standalone. LAP games are gaming machines that are located within a single casino and are electronically linked to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino. Our LAP gaming machines feature games including those offered as WAP as well as our proprietary brands such as Jackpot Party Progressive &#174; , Life of Luxury &#174; &#32;Progressive, 88 Fortunes &#174; , 5 Treasures &#174; , and Cash Spin TM . Our LAP products leverage both exclusive brand names and game play intellectual property, and typically offer players the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots, all of which tend to result in higher play volumes. We also provide certain standalone Participation games that are not linked to other gaming machines. Our standalone games feature titles, among others, under the licensed MONOPOLY brand and our proprietary brands, as well as other licensed brands in those jurisdictions where we do not operate a WAP system. Our standalone Participation gaming machines generally feature larger, more elaborate top-boxes and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game or on gaming machines that we sell. 

Other leased and Participation games 

&#8226; 

Server-based gaming : We provide wide-area gaming operators, such as LBOs, bingo halls and arcades, a comprehensive package of server-based products and services under long term contracts that typically include gaming machines, remote management of game content and management information, central computer systems, secure data communication and field support services. We are typically paid a fee based on the Net win generated by these gaming machines (subject to certain adjustments as may be specified in a particular contract, including adjustments for taxes and other fees). Our business in this category is primarily based in the U.K. 

&#8226; 

VLTs : Certain customers lease our multi-game and single-game VLTs, which include video gaming machines, mechanical reel gaming machines and video poker games. Our VLTs may be operated as standalone units or may interface with central monitoring systems operated by government agencies. Our VLTs are typically located in places where casino-style gaming is not the only attraction, such as racetracks, bars and restaurants. 

&#8226; 

Class II and centrally determined systems: &#32;We offer video and mechanical-reel gaming machines and VLTs for Class II and certain VLT jurisdictions where the game outcome is determined by a central server system that we provide. These Class II and centrally determined systems primarily operate in Native American casinos in Washington, Florida, Alabama and Oklahoma. We receive either a fixed daily fee or a percentage of the 

Net win generated by the gaming machines or VLTs connected to the central determination system and a small daily fee for the central determination system. 

Other gaming machine services 

&#8226; 

Customer-owned daily fee games: &#32;This category consists of gaming machines for which the customer purchases the base gaming machine and leases the top-box and/or game theme from us at a lower fixed daily lease payment than if they were to lease the entire gaming machine. Customer-owned daily fee games typically feature a second LCD screen in the top-box that provides additional bonus experiences for the player. 

&#8226; 

Licensing: We derive revenue from licensing our games and intellectual property to third parties. Methods for determining our license or royalty revenue vary, but are generally based on a fixed amount for each licensed game or product using the intellectual property purchased, placed or shipped in a period, a fixed daily royalty amount or a percentage of the revenue generated by the placement of the licensed game or product using the intellectual property. 

Table product leasing and licensing 

&#8226; 

Shuffler leasing: &#32;We offer Shuffler products under month-to-month lease arrangements that contain Participation rates or fixed monthly lease rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the customer&#8217;s request. 

&#8226; 

Proprietary table games ("PTG") licensing: We license our PTG content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators typically under month to month lease arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs which are designed to enhance operators' table-game operations, include our internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. Our proprietary content and features are also added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to electronic platforms . 

Revenues from our Gaming products and services to external customers accounted for 64%, 45% and 25% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Contract Procurement 

Our Gaming business product sales revenue is generated on an order-by-order basis. Certain of our gaming machines are sold with extended financing payment terms that are typically for a one-year period and, in some cases, up to three years. Casino-management systems are sold under contracts that generally include a combination of casino-management systems software licenses, systems-based hardware products, maintenance and product support fees and professional services. Our WAP, premium and daily fee lease contracts, our lease contracts for other leased and Participation products, our VLT central monitoring and control systems contracts, our table product lease contracts and our gaming services lease contracts can generally be terminated at any time upon notification by either the customer or us subject to the applicable notice periods. The revenue from our VLT central monitoring and control systems business is derived from one international customer and three U.S. customers and no individual contract represents a significant portion of our Gaming service revenues. See the risk factor captioned &#8220;We operate in highly competitive industries and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Four large bookmakers operate approximately 86% of the LBOs in the U.K. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our contracts with two of the large U.K. bookmakers represented a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. Our current contract with Ladbrokes plc (&#8220;Ladbrokes&#8221;) commenced on October 22, 2013 and is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. Our current contract with Gala Coral Group Ltd. (&#8220;Gala Coral&#8221;) commenced on January 1, 2010 and is set to expire on December 31, 2017. We expect to participate in the bidding process to continue to serve these customers after the expiration of their current contracts, although we cannot predict the outcome of that process. In July 2015, Ladbrokes and Gala Coral announced that they intend to merge. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA") is currently reviewing the proposed merger and may require that these operators divest a certain number of betting shops prior to consummating the contemplated transaction. As these two operators are the largest customers of our U.K. gaming business, their merger and any asset divestitures relating thereto, could negatively impact our business. 

Competition 

The gaming machine sector is highly competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new games, gaming machines and related technologies. We compete primarily with International Game Technology ("IGT"), a subsidiary of International Game Technology PLC (the successor of Gtech S.p.A), Ainsworth Game Technology, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd 

("Aristocrat"), Aruze Gaming America, Inc., Franco Gaming Ltd., Inspired Gaming Group Limited, Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. ("Konami"), Multimedia Games, Inc. (which is a subsidiary of EVERI Inc.) and the Novomatic Group of Companies. Our principal direct competitor in our U.K. LBO business is Inspired Gaming Group Limited. 

The casino-management systems business is also highly competitive. Product features and functionality, accuracy, reliability, service level and pricing are among the factors that determine how successful systems providers are in selling their systems. Our principal competitors in casino-management systems include Aristocrat, IGT, Konami and several smaller providers in international jurisdictions. Competition for these products is intense due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate. 

With respect to our table products, we compete on the basis of the breadth of our Shuffler products and services and PTGs, product reliability, service, the strength of our intellectual property and our extensive sales, regulatory and distribution channels. Our automated Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world. Finally, since the need for our Shuffler products is dependent upon the casino's use of live table games, our Shufflers also compete against any products that live table games compete against. 

Competition for PTG content is based on player appeal, brand recognition, price and the strength of the underlying intellectual property. We compete on this basis, as well as on the strength of our extensive sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We also compete with non-proprietary table games such as blackjack and baccarat, as well as several companies that primarily develop and license PTGs such as Galaxy Gaming, Inc., Masque Publishing, Inc. and DEQ Systems Corp. It is easier for smaller companies to participate in developing and marketing PTG content as compared to other gaming products due to the lower cost and complexity associated with the development of these products. Finally, some of our product lines may compete against each other for space on the casino floor. 

Lottery Segment 

There are approximately 180 lotteries throughout the world, operated by U.S. and international governmental authorities and their licensees. Governments typically authorize lotteries as a means of generating revenues without imposing additional taxes. Net lottery proceeds are generally set aside for public purposes, such as education, aid to the elderly, conservation, transportation and economic development. Many jurisdictions have come to rely on the proceeds from lottery game sales as a significant source of funding for these programs. Although there are many types of lottery games worldwide, the two principal categories of products offered are draw lottery games and instant lottery games. Currently, 44 U.S. jurisdictions (including Puerto Rico) offer instant game lotteries and 46 U.S. jurisdictions (including Puerto Rico) offer draw lotteries. Lottery operations in international jurisdictions can vary widely depending on the number of new lotteries entering the market, the number of lottery licenses issued within each market and the discontinuance of lotteries and operating licenses. 

An instant lottery game is typically played by removing a scratch-off protective coating from a preprinted ticket to reveal if it is a winner. Draw lottery games, such as POWERBALL &#174; &#32;and MEGA MILLIONS &#174; , are based on a random selection of a series of numbers, and prizes are generally based on the number of winners who share the prize pool, although set prizes are also offered. Draw lottery games are generally provided through a lottery system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery games and related functions. A lottery system may also be used to activate, sell and validate instant lottery games to confirm that a ticket is a winner and prevent duplicate payments. In some jurisdictions, separate instant game validation systems may be installed. 

Lotteries may offer a range of other games. In the U.S., some lotteries offer high frequency games such as keno, which is typically played every four to five minutes in restricted social settings, such as bars, and is usually offered as an extension of the lottery system. 

Based on third party data, U.S. instant lottery game retail sales and draw lottery retail sales totaled approximately $43 billion and approximately $25 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. We define U.S. lottery retail sales of draw games to primarily include retail sales of draw games, keno and instant games validated by the relevant system. Based on industry information published in the Lafleurs 2015 World Lottery Almanac, we estimate that worldwide instant lottery game retail sales and worldwide draw lottery retail sales totaled approximately $79 billion and $205 billion, respectively, during fiscal year 2014.

The types of products and services from which our Lottery segment derives its revenues are further discussed in Note 1 (Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for the last three fiscal years and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas is included in Note 2 (Business Segments). 

Instant Lottery Games &#160; 

We generate revenue from the manufacturing and sale of instant lottery games. Some of our contracts bundle the design and manufacturing of instant lottery games, instant game management systems and marketing and other services, such as the design and installation of game management software, inventory and distribution, sales, accounting, training and advisory services, market research and retailer training and recruitment. We are typically paid on a Participation basis under these contracts. We believe these services help lotteries effectively manage and support their operations, achieve higher retail sales and lower operating costs. We also provide licensed games and promotional and interactive marketing services to the lottery industry. 

We believe we are the leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of instant lottery games in the world. We market instant lottery games and related services to U.S. and international lotteries and commercial customers. We supply instant lottery games to 39 of the 44 U.S. jurisdictions (including Puerto Rico) that sell instant lottery games and have sold instant lottery games to customers in approximately 50 countries. Our U.S. instant lottery game contracts typically have an initial term of three to five years and frequently include multiple renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to five years, which our customers have generally exercised in the past. We typically sell our instant lottery games on a price-per-unit or Participation basis. Certain of our international customers purchase instant lottery games as needed rather than under multi-game supply contracts. 

We operate five instant lottery game printing facilities across four continents (including a facility owned by CSG) with an aggregate capacity to print in excess of 46 billion 2" by 4" equivalent standard instant lottery tickets annually. Our instant lottery tickets are typically printed on recyclable ticket stock by a series of computer-controlled presses and ink-jet imagers, which we believe incorporate the most advanced technology and security in the industry. Instant lottery tickets generally range in size from 2" by 3" to as large as 8" by 12". 

The technology and security capabilities necessary to manufacture and service instant lottery games continue to separate our business from conventional forms of printing. We believe we are generally recognized within the lottery industry as the leader in applying computer-based technologies to the manufacturing and sale of instant lottery games. In order to 

maintain our position as a leading innovator within the lottery industry, we intend to continue to invest in the development of new technologies for instant lottery games and systems. 

We provide lotteries with access to some of the world's most popular entertainment brands on lottery products, which we believe helps increase our customers' instant game sales. Our licensed entertainment brands include AMC &#174; -THE WALKING DEAD &#174; , HARLEY-DAVIDSON &#174; , LOTERIA &#174; , MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL &#174; , MARGARITAVILLE &#174; , MONOPOLY , NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION &#174; , THE PRICE IS RIGHT &#174; and SLINGO &#174; . We also provide branded merchandise, advertising, promotional support, drawing management services and prize fulfillment programs. In addition, we offer lotteries interactive marketing services through our Properties Plus &#174; &#32;program which features players clubs, reward programs, second chance promotional websites, interactive games and subscription systems that enable players to purchase lottery games securely over the internet. 

Lottery Systems 

We believe we are a leading provider of lottery systems including customized computer software, software support, equipment, and data communication services, to lotteries in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we typically provide the necessary equipment (including point-of-sale terminals), software and maintenance services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years under which we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of the lottery's total retail sales. Our U.S. contracts typically contain multiple renewal options that generally have been exercised by our customers in the past. Internationally, we typically sell point-of-sale terminals and/or computer software to lottery authorities and may provide ongoing fee-based systems and software support services. 

Our lottery systems use proprietary technology that facilitates high-speed processing of draw lottery game wagers as well as validation of winning draw and instant lottery games. This business includes the supply of proprietary transaction-processing software, draw lottery games, keno, point-of-sale terminals, central site computers and communication platforms as well as ongoing operational support and maintenance services. We have contracts to operate lottery systems for ten of the 46 U.S. jurisdictions (including Puerto Rico) that operate draw lotteries. In addition, we have a contract with the manager of the Indiana lottery to provide and maintain the point-of-sale terminal base. Internationally, we have lottery systems operating in Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, Spain and Switzerland. 

The fees we earn under our lottery systems contracts are generally included in our services revenue. Revenue from the sale of our point-of-sale terminals and/or computer software is included in our product sales revenue, while the fees we generate from ongoing systems and software support are generally included in our services revenue. 

We have strategic equity investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois, Northstar New Jersey, Hellenic Lotteries, CSG and GLB, which entities operate or assist in the operation of lotteries. We are also the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS and Northstar New Jersey and the exclusive provider of instant lottery games to Northstar Illinois and Hellenic Lotteries. Additional information regarding these equity investments is included in Note 11 (Equity Investments). 

Revenues from our Lottery products and services to external customers accounted for 28%, 47% and 72% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Contract Procurement 

Lotteries in the U.S. typically operate under state-mandated public procurement regulations. See further discussion in "Government Regulation" in this Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Lotteries typically select an instant game or lottery system by issuing a RFP, which outlines the products and services to be delivered and related contractual obligations. An evaluation committee frequently comprised of key lottery staff typically evaluates RFP responses based on various criteria, including the quality of product and/or technical solutions, security plan and features, experience in the industry, quality of personnel and services to be delivered and price. We believe that our product functionality and game content, the quality of our personnel, our technical expertise and our demonstrated ability to help lotteries increase their revenues may give us an advantage relative to our competitors when responding to lottery RFPs in the U.S. However, many lotteries award contracts to the qualified vendor strictly based on their offering the lowest price, regardless of these other factors. Contract awards by lottery authorities are sometimes challenged by vendors that were not selected, which can result in protracted legal proceedings. 

Internationally, lottery authorities do not always utilize a formal bidding process, but rather may engage in negotiations with one or more potential vendors. Our international lottery service contracts typically include automatic renewal provisions and may not have specified expiration dates. These service contracts can generally be terminated at any time upon notification by either the customer or us subject to the applicable notice periods. 

The table below lists our more significant lottery contracts representing approximately 34% of our Lottery revenue. The U.S. lottery industry's 2015 fiscal year generally ended on June 30, 2015. We are the exclusive provider of systems in the lottery 

systems contracts listed below and we are the primary supplier of instant lottery games. The commencement date of the contract is the date we began generating revenue under such contract, which for our Lottery contracts is typically the start-up date. The table below also includes instant or draw lottery game retail sales, (as applicable), if publicly available, for each jurisdiction.

Camelot Group plc is the lottery operator of the U.K. National Lottery. 

Competition 

The instant lottery game sector is highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal instant games competitors in the U.S. are IGT and Pollard Banknote Limited. Except as permitted by the North American Free Trade Agreement with respect to Canada, it is currently illegal to import lottery games into the U.S. from a foreign country. Our business could be adversely affected should additional international competitors in Canada export lottery products to the U.S. or should other international competitors establish instant game printing facilities in the U.S. or Canada to supply the U.S. Internationally, a number of instant lottery game vendors compete with us including the competitors noted above as well as diversified printers in India, China and Latin America. Our principal competitors in the supply of lottery-related licensed games, promotional entertainment and loyalty or rewards programs are Alchemy3 LLC, ePrize LLC, IGT, Pollard Banknote Limited and Intralot S.A. 

The lottery systems business is also highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal competitors in this business are IGT, Intralot S.A. and Tattersalls Group. We also compete with various suppliers of lottery system components, such as terminals and computer systems, as well as lottery operators that internally develop their own systems. 

As countries liberalize gaming regulations, lotteries may expand their scope by offering sports wagering, gaming machines, interactive gaming or other forms of gaming, which may introduce new suppliers that compete with us for lottery customers. In some jurisdictions, the liberalization of gaming regulations has included the privatization or outsourcing of all or a portion of the lottery operations via a competitive bidding process. We believe Camelot Group plc, the Tattersalls Group, IGT and Intralot, S.A. to be among those who may bid on such opportunities. 

Interactive Segment 

Our Interactive business segment includes social (non-wagering) gaming and interactive RMG. Through our Interactive segment, we make available WMS, Bally, SHFL, Barcrest and third-party branded content directly to players of social gaming, or&#8212;in the case of RMG&#8212;directly to online casino operators. Our SG Universe TM &#32;service features multiple platforms, which empower land-based casinos to increase engagement with their players at home, on-the-go and during each visit to the casino floor. Similar to traditional land-based gaming, the appeal and performance of our game content is an important contributor to our success in the interactive gaming business. Our Interactive gaming business is increasingly focused on products and services that operate on both mobile and desktop products and platforms. 

The following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Interactive business segment.

&#160; 

In our social gaming business, we earn revenue from the sale of virtual coins or chips, which players can use to play our games ( i.e. , spin in the case of slots, bet in the case of poker). Revenue is recorded when the purchased coins or chips are used by the customer. We also host play-for-fun and play-for-free services for traditional land-based casinos and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a share of the proceeds from the sale of virtual coins, or a mix of fixed fees and a share of such proceeds. 

&#8226; 

RMG : We serve online casino operators, primarily in Europe, by offering our games on a Participation basis. We host our game content on our centrally-located servers (often referred to as remote game servers) that are integrated into the online casino operators&#8217; websites. We typically earn a percentage of the operator&#8217;s net gaming revenue generated by their players playing the games we host. We also host on-premises interactive gaming for certain customers and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a revenue share with our online casino-customer, or a mix of fixed fees and revenue share. 

&#8226; 

SG Universe : We host play-for-fun and play-for-free services for traditional land-based casinos and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a share of the proceeds from the sale of virtual coins, or a mix of fixed fees and a share of such virtual coin proceeds. We also host on-premises interactive gaming for certain customers and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a revenue share with our online casino-customer, or a mix of fixed fees and revenue share. 

We believe that growth in our Interactive gaming business is driven largely through new channels of distribution, such as the various types of mobile gaming platforms, the expansion of legal interactive RMG jurisdictions, the addition of social gaming products, such as our newest social games Quick Hits Slots and &#32;Hot Shot Casino , both of which we launched in 2015, the number and quality of our proprietary and third-party branded games released and available to players, the addition of traditional land-based casino operators and RMG operators that are not currently customers, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts designed to engage new players and re-engage existing players, and the prominence of our offerings on operators&#8217; websites, which is not controlled by us. 

Virtually all sectors of the interactive gaming industry are impacted by changes in economic conditions that impact players&#8217; disposable income. 

Our revenue from the Interactive segment is included in services revenue. 

Revenues from our Interactive services to external customers accounted for 8%, 8% and 3% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Contract Procurement 

Our Interactive social gaming revenue is typically generated from a high volume of players' one-time purchase transactions of virtual coins which are used to play the games, whereas our RMG revenue is generated by royalty or Participation payments based on usage under license agreements with online casino operators that typically have a duration of approximately three years. 

Competition 

In our social gaming business, as games are free to play, we compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive gaming entertainment companies, and where our primary competitors include DoubleDown Interactive, a subsidiary of IGT, Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Big Fish Games Inc., a subsidiary of Churchill Downs, Inc., GSN/Bash Gaming, Product Madness, a subsidiary of Aristocrat, High 5 Games and Zynga Inc. In our RMG business, our primary competitors are Playtech Limited, Net Entertainment, Microgaming Software Systems Ltd., IGT, NYX Gaming Group and High 5 Games. 

Research and Product Development 

We believe our ability to attract new gaming, lottery and interactive gaming customers and retain existing customers depends in part on our ability to evolve our product line by continually developing world-class games, hardware and systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and customer profitability. We are also focused on expanding utilization of the internet and other interactive technologies to increase play. Our gaming machines are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff and internal and external game development studios with the input and cooperation of our customers. We believe that many of our innovations have become industry standards. 

We have Gaming R&#38;D personnel located primarily in our Las Vegas, Nevada R&#38;D facility and our state-of-the-art technology campus in Chicago, Illinois. A large portion of our Lottery R&#38;D team is based in our Alpharetta, Georgia facilities. We have Interactive personnel located primarily in Chicago, Illinois, Cedar Falls, Iowa and Tel Aviv, Israel. We also have game development studios in Las Vegas, Nevada, Sydney, Australia, Manchester, England and India (including Bangalore, Chennai and Pune), with additional R&#38;D staff for our Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming businesses in other locations, including Reno, Nevada and Vienna, Austria. Each of our game development studios works concurrently on multiple games and is staffed with producers, software developers, graphic artists, mathematicians, composers and game designers. We believe that we are able to more easily recruit and retain top talent to develop games and systems specific to each market as a result of our global presence. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our R&#38;D expense totaled $ 183.9 million , $117.0 million and $26.0 million, respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

Many of our products utilize intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We protect our investment in research and development by seeking intellectual property protection as appropriate for our technologies and content. We also acquire and license intellectual property from third parties. 

The terms of our patents vary based on the date and jurisdiction of filing. The term of U.S. patents generally expires 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application in a family of patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. Certain technologies, which are material to our Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming businesses, are the 

subject of patents issued and patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our Lottery business utilizes our patented and patent-pending technologies in the production, secure printing, validation and distribution of instant lottery games. Our Gaming and Interactive gaming businesses utilize our patented and patent-pending technologies in games and associated platforms and systems. In addition, we patent and license game content as part of our licensed properties and Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming businesses. 

We market many of our products under trademarks and copyrights that provide product differentiation and recognition and promote our portfolio of product offerings. All of our games feature elements subject to copyright rights and protection. In addition, we generally obtain trademark protection and often seek to register trademarks for the names and designs under which we market and license our products and games. Protections for trademarks exist in many countries, including the U.S., for as long as the trademark is registered and/or used. Registrations are generally issued for fixed, but renewable terms, although trademark rights may exist whether or not a mark is registered and the duration of the registrations vary by country. 

We believe that our use of both our own and third party licensed brand names and related intellectual property contributes to the appeal and success of our products, and that our future ability to license, acquire or develop new brand names is important to our continued success. Therefore, we continue to invest in the recognition of our brands and brands that we license. Certain of our games are based on popular brands licensed from third parties, such as Hasbro International, Inc., Fremantle Media North America, CBS Studios Inc., Turner Entertainment Co., Warner Bros. Consumer Products Inc., Harley-Davidson, Playboy Enterprises International, Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Hearst Holdings Inc., King Features Syndicate Division, Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association. Brand license terms typically obligate us to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the duration of the license period and to make advance payments against those commitments. Licensors also typically have the right to inspect and approve the use of licensed property. 

IGT administers a pool of patents relating to "ticket-in ticket-out" technology that enables casino patrons to cash out from a gaming machine and receive a printed ticket instead of coins. This technology is utilized in substantially all of our gaming machines. We have a license for certain patents related to this technology through the expiration date of the relevant patents. 

From time to time we become aware of potential infringement of our intellectual property by competitors and other third parties and consider what action, if any, to take in that regard, including litigation where appropriate. We are also subject to threatened or actual intellectual property-related claims by third parties from time to time. 

Production Processes, Sources and Availability of Components 

We currently produce substantially all of our gaming machines at our facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and Sydney, Australia. We also have finishing lines in our Barcelona, Spain facility, as well as in Midrand, South Africa, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Manchester, England. These finishing lines allow for the completion and testing of our gaming machine assemblies from our facilities in Las Vegas. We also refurbish used gaming machines primarily at our Las Vegas facilities. In connection with the integration of the Bally acquisition, in 2015 we moved our manufacturing operations from Waukegan, Illinois to Las Vegas and are in the process of selling our Waukegan facility. 

Manufacturing commitments are generally based on expected quarterly sales orders from customers. Due to uneven order flow from customers, component parts common to all gaming machines are purchased and assembled into partial products that are inventoried to be able to quickly fill final customer orders. Our gaming machine manufacturing processes generally consist of assembling component parts and sub-assemblies into a complete gaming machine. 

Shufflers, including automatic card shufflers and roulette chip sorters, are assembled in one of our Las Vegas facilities and by a third party near Salzburg, Austria. 

Hardware and component parts associated with our casino-management systems are housed primarily in our Las Vegas facilities. These parts do not require a significant amount of assembly and are used primarily in systems implementations, which take place at customer locations. 

Our dedicated computer-controlled printing process is specifically designed to produce secure instant lottery games for government-sanctioned lotteries. We also have the capability to track instant games from the point of production through delivery to retailers. Instant lottery games are delivered finished and ready for distribution by the lottery authority (or by us under certain contracts). An instant lottery game that has been removed at any point in the distribution chain in an unauthorized manner can be flagged and invalidated in the event that it is used to claim winnings. Paper and ink are the principal raw materials consumed in our instant lottery manufacturing operations. 

Production of our lottery terminals (and related component products) primarily involves the assembly of electronic and mechanical components into more complex systems and products. Third-party vendors generally manufacture and assemble our lottery terminals. We normally have sufficient lead time between reaching an agreement and the commencement of operations so that we are able to provide our Lottery customers with a fully functioning system that is customized to meet their requirements. The lead time for obtaining most of the electronic components that we use is approximately 90 days. We believe that this is consistent with our competitors' lead times and is also consistent with the needs of our customers. We place advance orders for those components that have long lead times in anticipation of firm purchase orders from our customers, provided that the investment in inventory and the risk of the customer order not materializing are deemed acceptable. 

The raw materials used in manufacturing our lottery terminals and gaming machines include various metals, plastics, wood, glass and numerous component parts, including electronic sub-assemblies, computer boards and LCD screens. We believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials are generally adequate. 

Seasonality 

Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally highest in the spring and summer. See the risk factor captioned "Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, and therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance" under the heading "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 8,500 &#32;persons worldwide, with approximately 5,100 &#32;employed domestically and 3,400 &#32;employed internationally. 

Government Regulation 

General 

The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of operators, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, as well as their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 

While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, there can be no assurance that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 

We have developed and implemented a rigorous internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming and Lottery activities, as well as legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our chief compliance officer with legal advice provided by attorneys in our legal and compliance departments as well as outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the compliance committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of employee and non-employee directors and a non-employee gaming law expert. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our compliance program will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses. 

In the EU, various judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") have addressed the approaches adopted by certain member states to restrict and/or regulate gaming. Topics addressed in those judgments include the ability of member states to grant, or to maintain, monopolies for gaming and lottery activities and the power of member states to limit access by gaming and/or lottery providers established elsewhere in the EU. Several cases on these subjects are currently pending in the CJEU. 

While we believe that we have developed appropriate procedures and policies to comply with the requirements of these evolving laws and legal pronouncements, there can be no assurance that our activities or the activities of our customers 

will not become the subject of law enforcement proceedings or that any such proceedings would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business plans. Furthermore, laws and regulations applicable to lotteries and gaming in U.S. and international jurisdictions are subject to change and the effect of such changes on our ongoing and potential operations cannot be predicted with certainty. 

From time to time, we retain government affairs representatives in various U.S. and international jurisdictions to advise elected and appointed officials and the public concerning our views on gaming and lottery-related legislation, as well as to monitor such legislation and to advise us in our relations with gaming and lottery authorities. 

Gaming 

We provide our games, gaming machines, gaming systems, table products and related products and services in legal gaming jurisdictions worldwide. The manufacture, distribution, provision and operation of our gaming products and services is subject to regulation and approval by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal and foreign agencies. The primary purposes of these rules are to (1) ensure the responsibility, financial stability and character of the parties involved in these activities through licensing requirements, (2) ensure the integrity and compliance of our gaming products and services and (3) prohibit the use of gaming products and services at unauthorized locations or for the benefit of undesirable parties. 

Typically, gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we are licensed: 

&#8226; 

adopt additional rules and regulations under the implementing statutes; 

&#8226; 

investigate violations of gaming regulations; 

&#8226; 

enforce gaming regulations and impose disciplinary sanctions for violations of such laws, including fines, penalties and revocation of gaming licenses; 

&#8226; 

review the character and fitness of manufacturers, distributors and operators of gaming products and services and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure; 

&#8226; 

grant licenses for the manufacture, distribution and operation of gaming products and services; 

&#8226; 

review and approve transactions (such as acquisitions, material commercial transactions, securities offerings and debt transactions); and 

&#8226; 

establish and collect related fees and/or taxes. 

We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business. We are authorized to sell, lease or operate our gaming products and services in approximately 450 jurisdictions worldwide (including jurisdictions that do not require licensing), including approximately 170 international gaming jurisdictions. 

In addition, a number of U.S. states authorize wagering on VLTs at state regulated and licensed facilities. Although some states restrict VLTs to already existing wagering facilities ( e.g. , racetracks), others permit these machines to be placed at venues such as bars, restaurants, truck stops and other specifically licensed gaming facilities. In addition, all of the Canadian provinces and various other international jurisdictions have authorized VLTs. 

Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders and key employees. Our gaming hardware and software also must be approved either by a gaming authority laboratory or a private laboratory authorized by the gaming authority. 

Lottery 

Forty-four U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, all the Canadian provinces, China and many other countries outside the U.S., including countries in Europe, currently authorize lotteries. The operation of lotteries in the U.S. and internationally is subject to extensive regulation. Although certain features of a lottery, such as the percentage of gross revenues that must be paid back to players in prize money, are usually set by legislation, lottery regulatory authorities generally exercise significant discretion, including with respect to the determination of the types of games played, the price of each wager, the manner in which the lottery is marketed and the selection of suppliers of equipment, technology and services and retailers of lottery products. 

To ensure the integrity of contract awards and lottery operations, most jurisdictions require detailed background disclosure on a continuous basis from, and conduct background investigations of, vendors and their officers, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates and principal stockholders. Background investigations of the vendors' employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of lottery systems are also generally conducted and most states reserve the right to require the removal of employees who they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery. Certain jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically five percent or more) of a vendor's securities. The failure of such beneficial owners of our securities to submit to background checks and provide such disclosure could result in the imposition of penalties upon these beneficial owners and could jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to us or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract. 

The award of lottery contracts and ongoing operations of lotteries in international jurisdictions are also extensively regulated, although international regulations typically vary from those prevailing in the U.S. Restrictions are frequently imposed on foreign companies seeking to do business in such jurisdictions and, as a consequence, we have in a number of instances allied ourselves with local companies when seeking international lottery contracts. 

Interactive 

In the United States, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ("UIGEA") prohibits among other things, the acceptance by a gambling business of a wager by means of the internet where such wager is prohibited by any applicable law where initiated, received or otherwise made. UIGEA imposes potentially severe criminal and civil sanctions on the owners and operators of such systems and on financial institutions that process wagering transactions. The law contains a safe harbor for wagers placed within a single state (disregarding intermediate routing of the transmission) where the method of placing the bet and receiving the bet is authorized by that state's law, provided the underlying regulations establish appropriate age and location verification. 

Within the past few years, state-authorized internet casino gaming has been launched in Delaware and New Jersey and state authorized online poker has been launched in Nevada. A number of other states are also considering adopting legislation to specifically authorize interactive gaming or online poker. Additionally, two state lotteries offer (and other lotteries are considering offering) internet instant game sales to in-state lottery customers and a number of other states allow subscription sales of draw games over the internet. 

However, there have been various bills proposed recently in the U.S. to restrict or prohibit interactive gaming and lottery sales. Very significant resources are being devoted to supporting these efforts. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, there can be no assurance that laws restricting interactive gaming or lottery sales will not be passed at either the federal or state level. For instance, in May 2015, the Minnesota legislature passed an amendment to the state&#8217;s lottery law prohibiting the sale of instant win lottery tickets over the internet. Furthermore, changes in the executive branches of government at the state and federal level could affect federal and state policies on gaming as well. 

To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken steps to change the regulation of internet wagering through the implementation of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, some of which include the imposition of sanctions on unlicensed providers. Countries outside Europe and the U.S. have also begun evaluating interactive gaming regulation and an increase in regulated markets outside of the U.S. and Europe is likely to continue. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries. 

We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign regulations relating to Interactive gaming and Lottery sales. 

Additional Information Regarding Government Regulations 

As the gaming regulations of many jurisdictions are similar and we operate in a large number of jurisdictions, we are not including descriptions of the specific gaming requirements in the different jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional information, we have filed a summary of the gaming regulations that govern our businesses as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Exhibit 99.12 (Gaming Regulations). In addition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors related to gaming and lottery regulations to which we may be subject.
