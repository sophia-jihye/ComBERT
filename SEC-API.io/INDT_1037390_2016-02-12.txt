 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

On May 13, 2015, Griffin Land &#38; Nurseries, Inc. changed its name to Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc. ("Griffin") to reflect better Griffin's ongoing real estate business that is principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial and commercial properties. Griffin also seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or purchase of buildings. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin's core development and leasing strategy. 

Until January 8, 2014, Griffin also operated a landscape nursery business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. ("Imperial"). Imperial was engaged in the growing of containerized plants for sale principally to independent retail garden centers and rewholesalers, whose main customers are landscape contractors. On January 8, 2014, Griffin and Imperial entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Imperial's inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia Connecticut LLC ("Monrovia"), a subsidiary of Monrovia Nursery Company, for approximately $0.7 million in cash, before transaction and severance costs, and a non-interest bearing note receivable of $4.25 million (the "Imperial Sale"). Monrovia paid $2.75 million of the note receivable on June 1, 2014 and the remaining balance on June 1, 2015. Concurrently with the Imperial Sale, Imperial and River Bend Holdings, LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin, entered into a Lease and Option Agreement and an Addendum to such agreement (the "Imperial Lease," and together with the Imperial Sale, the "Imperial Transaction") with Monrovia, pursuant to which Monrovia is leasing Imperial's Connecticut production nursery for a ten year period, with options to extend for up to an additional fifteen years exercisable by Monrovia. The Imperial Lease also grants Monrovia an option to purchase the land, land improvements and other operating assets that were used by Imperial in its Connecticut growing operations during the first thirteen years of the lease period for $10.5 million, or $7.0 million if only a certain portion of the land is purchased, subject in each case to certain adjustments as provided for in the Imperial Lease. 

Through fiscal 2009, all of Griffin's real estate assets, including buildings and undeveloped land, were located in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut. In fiscal 2010, Griffin started the expansion of its real estate holdings to areas outside of Hartford by purchasing an industrial building and undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania (see Lehigh Valley on page 9). Griffin expects to continue to seek to acquire and develop properties that are consistent with its core strategy of developing and leasing industrial and commercial properties. Griffin expects that most of such potential acquisitions of either undeveloped land or land and buildings will likely be located outside of the Hartford area. 

The greater Hartford industrial market had been slow in recent years, but experienced some recovery in 2014 and 2015. A national real estate services company reported that the overall vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased from 12.3% at the end of 2014 to 9.6% at the end of 2015. The greater Hartford office market remained weak in 2015 with a national real estate services company reporting that the overall vacancy rate increased from 15.8% at the end of 2014 to 16.7% at the end of 2015. In the greater Hartford area, there are a number of warehouse facilities and office buildings, some of which are fully or partially vacant, that are competitive with Griffin's industrial/warehouse buildings and office/flex buildings. Griffin believes that it benefits from its reputation as a stable landlord with sufficient resources to meet its obligations and deliver space to tenants timely and in accordance with the terms of their lease agreements. 

The industrial/warehouse market in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania has experienced a fairly strong level of leasing activity during the past several years, reported vacancy rates are low and rental rates have generally increased over the past five years. A national real estate services company reported that the overall vacancy rate in the Lehigh Valley industrial market was less than 5% in 2014 

and 2015. As a result of the relatively strong market, there has been an increase in the construction of industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley. 

Additional capacity or an increase in vacancies in either the industrial or office market could adversely affect Griffin's operating results by potentially resulting in longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates in Griffin's properties or hindering renewals by existing tenants. There can be no assurances as to the directions of the Hartford and Lehigh Valley real estate markets in the near future. 

As of November 30, 2015, Griffin owned thirty-two buildings comprising approximately 3.0 million square feet. Approximately 86% of this square footage is industrial/warehouse space, with the balance principally being office/flex space. As of November 30, 2015, approximately 89% of Griffin's industrial/warehouse space was leased and approximately 85% of Griffin's office/flex space was leased. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin leased approximately 102,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive ("4270 Fritch Drive"), a 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building developed by Griffin in fiscal 2014 on land in the Lehigh Valley acquired in fiscal 2010. Had that lease been completed as of November 30, 2015, the percentage of industrial/warehouse space leased as of that date would have been 92%. As stated in "Item 2. Properties" below, Griffin uses nonrecourse mortgages to finance some of its real estate development activities, and as of November 30, 2015, approximately $90.4 million was outstanding under such loans. In fiscal 2015, Griffin's rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties was approximately $16.2 million, while debt service on Griffin's nonrecourse mortgages was approximately $6.4 million. 

In fiscal 2015, Griffin completed and placed in service an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building ("5220 Jaindl Boulevard") in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. The tenant that initially leased approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl Boulevard at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter when the building was placed in service subsequently exercised its option under the lease to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue on the additional space will commence in fiscal 2016. In addition to leasing the approximately 280,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl Boulevard in fiscal 2015, Griffin completed several other leases aggregating approximately 191,000 square feet, of which approximately 90% was for industrial/warehouse space and approximately 10% was for office/flex space. In fiscal 2015, several leases aggregating approximately 52,000 square feet of office/flex space expired and were not renewed and a lease of approximately 31,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space was terminated early for which Griffin received a lease termination fee. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 421,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 and a decrease of approximately 33,000 square feet in office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014. In fiscal 2015, Griffin also renewed and extended several leases aggregating approximately 326,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space and approximately 71,000 square feet of office/flex space. 

In fiscal 2014, Griffin entered into three new leases of industrial/warehouse space for an aggregate of approximately 371,000 square feet and three new leases of office/flex space for an aggregate of approximately 38,000 square feet. The leasing of industrial/warehouse space in fiscal 2014 included a five year lease for approximately 201,000 square feet at 4270 Fritch Drive. In fiscal 2014, Griffin also entered into a ten year full building lease for approximately 138,000 square feet in one of its industrial buildings in New England Tradeport ("NE Tradeport"), Griffin's industrial park in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut. In fiscal 2014, leases of industrial/warehouse space aggregating approximately 43,000 square feet expired and were not renewed, and a lease of industrial/warehouse space increased by approximately 47,000 square feet as the remaining vacant space in the building was added to the leased space in accordance with the lease terms. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 374,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2014 as compared to November 30, 2013, while office/flex space under lease was essentially unchanged at 

November 30, 2014 as compared to November 30, 2013. Griffin also renewed and extended several leases aggregating approximately 27,000 square feet of office/flex space and approximately 11,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in fiscal 2014. 

In fiscal 2013, Griffin entered into three new leases of industrial/warehouse space for an aggregate of approximately 259,000 square feet and several new leases of office/flex space for an aggregate of approximately 49,000 square feet. The new leasing of industrial/warehouse space reflected a five year full building lease of an approximately 228,000 square foot industrial building ("4275 Fritch Drive") in the Lehigh Valley and approximately 31,000 square feet in Griffin's NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings. Also in fiscal 2013, several leases of industrial/warehouse space aggregating approximately 168,000 square feet expired and were not renewed. In fiscal 2013, two leases for office/flex space aggregating approximately 24,000 square feet expired and were not renewed or terminated early. In fiscal 2013, Griffin renewed and extended several leases aggregating approximately 116,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space and approximately 20,000 square feet of office/flex space. Included in the fiscal 2013 lease renewals was a full building lease of approximately 100,000 square feet that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2014 but was extended for ten years. 

Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which does not fit into Griffin's core strategy of developing and leasing industrial and commercial properties. Such sale transactions may take place either before or after obtaining development approvals and building basic infrastructure. 

In fiscal 2015, Griffin completed one land sale for approximately $0.6 million. In fiscal 2014, Griffin also completed one land sale for approximately $0.6 million. In fiscal 2013, Griffin completed three land sales, the principal one of which was the sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Windsor, Connecticut (the "Windsor Land Sale") for cash proceeds of approximately $9.0 million, before transaction expenses. The land sold under the Windsor Land Sale is part of an approximately 253 acre parcel of undeveloped land that had been held by Griffin for an extended time period. Under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin and the buyer were each required to construct roadways connecting the land parcel that was sold to existing town roads. The roads constructed by the buyer and the road being constructed by Griffin will become new town roads, thereby providing access to the remaining acreage in Griffin's land parcel. As a result of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method, under which the revenue and gain on sale are recognized as the total costs related to the property sold are incurred. Griffin also closed on two smaller land sales in fiscal 2013 for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately $0.3 million. 

The weakness in the residential real estate market has adversely affected Griffin's residential real estate development activities. The continued weakness of the residential real estate market could result in lower selling prices for Griffin's land intended for residential use or delay the sale of such land. 

Griffin's development of its land is affected by regulatory and other constraints. Subdivision and other residential development may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate residential growth. Industrial and commercial development activities on Griffin's undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies. 

Griffin does not maintain a corporate website. Griffin's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and the proxy statement for Griffin's Annual Meeting of Stockholders can be accessed through the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Griffin will provide electronic or paper copies of its foregoing filings free of charge upon request. Griffin was incorporated in 1970. 

Commercial and Industrial Developments 

New England Tradeport 

A significant portion of Griffin's commercial and industrial development effort has been focused on NE Tradeport, a master-planned industrial park near Bradley International Airport and Interstate 91, located in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut. Within NE Tradeport, Griffin has built and currently owns approximately 1,466,000 square feet of warehouse/industrial space in thirteen buildings, of which approximately 90% was leased as of November 30, 2015. 

Within NE Tradeport, Griffin holds the rights to 795,000 square feet available for development under the State Traffic Certificate ("STC") which relates to four approved building sites on approximately 70 acres and an approved addition to one of Griffin's existing buildings. Griffin owns an additional 95 acres of undeveloped land within NE Tradeport, 60 acres of which are located in Windsor and the abutting 35 acres of which are located in East Granby. There are no STC or other approvals currently in place (other than zoning in the case of Windsor) for the development of this remaining land for industrial use. Griffin believes that additional infrastructure improvements, which may be significant, may be required to obtain approvals to develop portions of this land, particularly the portions in East Granby. In connection with a land sale in fiscal 2012, a sewer line was brought to an accessible point near the edge of this 95 acre combined parcel. Griffin intends to continue to direct much of its real estate efforts in Connecticut on the construction and leasing of its industrial/warehouse facilities at NE Tradeport. 

In fiscal 2015, Griffin leased approximately 172,000 square feet of previously vacant space in NE Tradeport and renewed several leases aggregating approximately 326,000 square feet. The rental rates for leases in NE Tradeport that were renewed in fiscal 2015 were, on average, approximately 8% lower than the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the two NE Tradeport leases aggregating approximately 62,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2016 are above the market rates for similar space. 

As of November 30, 2015, approximately $60.5 million was invested (net book value) in buildings owned by Griffin that are located in NE Tradeport and approximately $4.4 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in the undeveloped NE Tradeport land. As of November 30, 2015, ten of Griffin's NE Tradeport buildings were mortgaged for an aggregate of approximately $42.3 million. Two NE Tradeport buildings built in fiscal 2007 and an older NE Tradeport building, aggregating, for the three buildings, approximately 373,000 square feet, currently are not mortgaged. A summary of Griffin's square footage owned and leased in NE Tradeport at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in NE Tradeport scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Square Footage Owned &#160; Square Footage Leased* &#160; Percentage Leased &#160; November 30, 2013 &#160; &#160; 1,466,000 &#160; &#160; 981,000 &#160; &#160; 67 % November 30, 2014 &#160; &#160; 1,466,000 &#160; &#160; 1,154,000 &#160; &#160; 79 % November 30, 2015 &#160; &#160; 1,466,000 &#160; &#160; 1,326,000 &#160; &#160; 90 %

* The square footage leased as of November 30, 2013 did not include approximately 47,000 square feet of space on which the tenant paid operating expenses. As required under the terms of the lease, the tenant took occupancy and started paying rent on August 1, 2014. 

Griffin Center and Griffin Center South 

Griffin's other substantial commercial development in Connecticut is the combination of its buildings in Griffin Center in Windsor and Bloomfield, Connecticut and Griffin Center South in Bloomfield. Griffin owns approximately 617,000 of the 2,165,000 square feet of developed space in these master planned developments. 

Griffin Center 

Within Griffin Center, Griffin owns two multi-story office buildings that have an aggregate of approximately 161,000 square feet, a single story office building of approximately 48,000 square feet, a 165,000 square foot industrial building ("1985 Blue Hills Avenue"), which is used principally as office, data center and call center space and a small restaurant building. 

In fiscal 2015, two leases aggregating approximately 33,000 square feet in Griffin Center expired and were not renewed, and two leases aggregating approximately 25,000 square feet were renewed. The rental rates for leases in Griffin Center that were renewed in fiscal 2015 were essentially the same as the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the two Griffin Center leases aggregating approximately 46,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2016 are slightly above the market rates for similar space. 

Currently there are approximately 207 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center owned by Griffin. In the fiscal 2014 third quarter, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell approximately 30 acres of an approximately 45 acre land parcel of the undeveloped land in Griffin Center for a purchase price of a minimum of $3.25 million, subject to adjustment based on the actual number of acres conveyed. Completion of this transaction is subject to significant contingencies, including the satisfactory completion of due diligence by the purchaser (a public educational authority in the state of Connecticut) and the purchaser obtaining a commitment from the State of Connecticut to fund the land acquisition and develop the property as planned by the purchaser. If this sale were to be completed, the development potential of the remaining approximately 15 acres, much of which are wetlands, of that land parcel will be severely limited. In fiscal 2015, the purchaser's due diligence period was extended through September 15, 2016. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all. 

As of November 30, 2015, approximately $16.1 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin's buildings in Griffin Center and approximately $0.8 million was invested by Griffin in the undeveloped land there. Griffin's two multi-story office buildings and 1985 Blue Hills Avenue in Griffin Center are separately mortgaged for an aggregate of approximately $13.6 million, and Griffin's single story office building is included as collateral under Griffin's $12.5 million revolving line of credit. There were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of November 30, 2015. 

As of November 30, 2015, approximately 324,000 square feet of Griffin's buildings in Griffin Center were leased, comprising approximately 85% of Griffin's total space in Griffin Center. A summary of Griffin's square footage owned and leased in Griffin Center at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin Center scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Square Footage Owned &#160; Square Footage Leased &#160; Percentage Leased &#160; November 30, 2013 &#160; &#160; 382,000 &#160; &#160; 373,000 &#160; &#160; 98 % November 30, 2014 &#160; &#160; 382,000 &#160; &#160; 357,000 &#160; &#160; 93 % November 30, 2015 &#160; &#160; 382,000 &#160; &#160; 324,000 &#160; &#160; 85 %

Griffin Center South 

Griffin currently owns nine buildings in Griffin Center South with an aggregate of approximately 235,000 square feet, of which approximately 217,000 square feet is single story office and flex space and approximately 18,000 square feet is storage space. As of November 30, 2015, the amount of space leased in Griffin Center South was the same as it was as of November 30, 2014, as the overall effect on space under lease of a lease termination, a new lease and a tenant relocating within Griffin Center South was neutral. In fiscal 2015, Griffin also renewed three leases aggregating approximately 45,000 square feet of office/flex space in Griffin Center South. The rental rates for leases in Griffin Center South that were renewed in fiscal 2015 were essentially the same as the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the three Griffin Center South leases aggregating approximately 44,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2016 are consistent with market rates for similar space. 

As of November 30, 2015, approximately $7.7 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin's buildings in Griffin Center South and approximately $0.7 million was invested by Griffin in the undeveloped land there. As of November 30, 2015, Griffin's nine properties in Griffin Center South are included as collateral under Griffin's $12.5 million revolving line of credit. There were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of November 30, 2015. Additionally, Griffin owns approximately 68 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center South. 

As of November 30, 2015, approximately 227,000 square feet of space in the Griffin Center South buildings owned by Griffin was leased, comprising 97% of Griffin's total space in Griffin Center South. In fiscal 2014, Griffin received notice from a tenant that has a full building lease for approximately 40,000 square feet in Griffin Center South that it was exercising its early termination option and will terminate its lease in fiscal 2016 (three years earlier than the original lease expiration date). In accordance with the lease terms, Griffin received approximately $557,000 from the tenant when the early termination notice was rendered. A summary of Griffin's square footage owned and leased in 

Griffin Center South at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin Center South scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows:

Lehigh Valley Industrial Properties and Other Property 

Lehigh Valley 

In fiscal 2010, Griffin completed its first acquisition of property outside of the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it acquired a fully leased approximately 120,000 square foot industrial building ("871 Nestle Way") in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, which is located in the Lehigh Valley. Subsequent to the purchase of 871 Nestle Way, Griffin and the tenant in that building agreed to a nine year extension of the lease, through 2025. Also in fiscal 2010, Griffin acquired approximately 51 acres of undeveloped land in Lower Nazareth, Pennsylvania, a major industrial area of the Lehigh Valley, which Griffin named Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. The land acquired had approvals for the development of two industrial buildings totaling approximately 530,000 square feet. In fiscal 2012, Griffin completed construction, on speculation, of 4275 Fritch Drive, an approximately 228,000 square foot industrial building, the first of two buildings built in Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. In fiscal 2013, Griffin entered into a five-year full building lease of this building. In fiscal 2014, Griffin completed construction, also on speculation, of 4270 Fritch Drive, an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial building, the second of two buildings in Lehigh Valley Tradeport I. In fiscal 2014, Griffin entered into a five year lease of approximately 201,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch Drive and the lease became effective in the fiscal 2015 second quarter upon completion of tenant improvements. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2015, Griffin leased the remaining approximately 102,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch Drive. That new lease is expected to become effective in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. 

In fiscal 2015, Griffin built an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building ("5220 Jaindl Boulevard") on undeveloped land in Hanover Township of the Lehigh Valley acquired in December 2013, known as Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. 5220 Jaindl Boulevard, completed at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter, is the first of two industrial/warehouse buildings to be built in Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. In fiscal 2015, Griffin leased approximately 196,000 square feet of 5220 Jaindl Boulevard. The lease commenced at the beginning of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, and in November 2015, the tenant exercised its option to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue for the remaining space in 5220 Jaindl Boulevard is expected to commence in fiscal 2016. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2015, Griffin started construction of 5210 Jaindl Boulevard, an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building to be developed in Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. Construction of the building shell of 5210 Jaindl Boulevard is expected to be completed in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. 

As of November 30, 2015, Griffin owned four industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 931,000 square feet with a fifth building under construction. Including the new lease in 4270 Fritch Drive completed subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin's four Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings are fully leased. Approximately $56.8 million was invested (net book value) in these buildings as of November 30, 2015. The four completed Lehigh Valley buildings are mortgaged under three separate nonrecourse mortgage loans for a total of approximately $34.6 million as of November 30, 2015. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin received additional mortgage proceeds of $2.6 million as a result of the tenant exercising its option to lease the balance of 5220 Jaindl Boulevard and additional mortgage proceeds of $1.85 million upon leasing the approximately 102,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive that had been vacant. 

A summary of Griffin's square footage owned and leased in Griffin's Lehigh Valley properties at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin's Lehigh Valley properties scheduled to expire during each of the next three fiscal years are as follows:

Other Property 

Griffin owns a 31,000 square foot warehouse building in Bloomfield, Connecticut on an approximately 5 acre site that is part of an approximately 253 acre land parcel known as Phoenix Crossing, located in Bloomfield and Windsor, Connecticut. In fiscal 2015, Griffin and the tenant in the warehouse building agreed to an early termination of the tenant's lease in exchange for a payment of $222,000. The building was vacant as of November 30, 2015, but subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin leased the entire building to a tenant that will expand and relocate from space it currently leases in one of Griffin's multi-story office buildings in Griffin Center. In fiscal 2013, Griffin sold approximately 90 acres of the Phoenix Crossing land in the Windsor Land Sale. Griffin owns the remaining approximately 159 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing which is zoned for industrial and commercial development. 

Griffin may seek to acquire additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate business. Griffin continues to examine potential properties in the northeast and mid-Atlantic areas for potential acquisition. 

Residential Developments 

Simsbury 

Several years ago, Griffin filed plans for the creation of a residential community, called Meadowood, on a 363 acre site in the Town of Simsbury, Connecticut ("Simsbury"). After several years of litigation with the town regarding this proposed residential development, a settlement was reached. 

The settlement terms included, among other things, approval for up to 296 homes, certain remediation measures and offsite road improvements to be performed by Griffin and the purchase by Simsbury of a portion of the Meadowood land for open space. The sale of land to Simsbury closed in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2012, Griffin performed a portion of the required remediation work on the site and completed the required offsite road improvements. In fiscal 2014, Griffin completed the required remediation work. As of November 30, 2015, Griffin has reclassified the costs related to the Meadowood development from real estate held for sale to real estate assets on its consolidated balance sheet because this development no longer met the criteria for real estate held for sale. As of November 30, 2015, the book value of the land for this development, including design, development and legal costs, was approximately $8.5 million. Griffin is continuing to evaluate its plans for Meadowood, including how best to position this property for sale. 

Griffin owns another approximate 432 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, portions of which are zoned for residential use and other portions of which are zoned for industrial use. Not all of this land is developable. The land currently zoned for industrial use is probably more suited to commercial or mixed-use development. Griffin may seek to develop or sell such land. 

Suffield 

In fiscal 2006, Griffin completed the infrastructure for a fifty lot residential subdivision in Suffield, Connecticut called Stratton Farms. Griffin sold twenty-five residential lots in Stratton Farms to a local homebuilder in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2010, Griffin entered into an agreement with a privately owned regional homebuilder under which in exchange for a payment of $100,000, the homebuilder obtained an option to purchase the remaining twenty-five residential lots of Stratton Farms. The option agreement terminated after four lots were sold. Subsequently, Griffin sold one Stratton Farms residential lot in fiscal 2013. As of November 30, 2015, Griffin held twenty Stratton Farms residential lots. The book value for Griffin's Stratton Farms holdings was approximately $1.1 million at November 30, 2015. 

Other 

In fiscal 2015, Griffin leased approximately 500 acres of undeveloped land in Connecticut and Massachusetts to local farmers. Approximately 424 acres and 512 acres were leased to local farmers in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. The revenue generated from the leasing of farmland is not material to Griffin's total revenue. 

On January 25, 2016, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the "Option Agreement") whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive three month option, in exchange for a nominal fee, to purchase approximately 280 acres of land for approximately $7.7 million. The buyer may extend the option period up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. The land subject to the Option Agreement is undeveloped and does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer's planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process that would require the use of the land and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of land as contemplated under the Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all. 

Griffin is evaluating its other properties for development or sale in the future. Griffin anticipates that obtaining subdivision approvals for residential development in many of the towns where it owns residentially-zoned land will be an extended process. 

Landscape Nursery Business 

Griffin and Imperial entered into a Purchase Agreement with Monrovia, effective January 8, 2014, pursuant to which Imperial's inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia for approximately $0.7 million in cash (before transaction and severance costs) and a non-interest bearing note receivable (the "Promissory Note") of $4.25 million. The Promissory Note was paid off on schedule, with $2.75 million received on June 1, 2014 and $1.5 million received on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Imperial Sale, Griffin and Imperial agreed to indemnify Monrovia for any potential environmental liabilities relating to periods prior to the effective date of the Purchase Agreement. 

Concurrently with the completion of the Imperial Sale, Imperial and River Bend Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin, entered into the Imperial Lease with Monrovia, pursuant to which Monrovia agreed to lease Imperial's Connecticut production nursery for a ten year period, with an option to extend for up to an additional fifteen years exercisable by Monrovia. The Imperial Lease provides for a net annual rent payable to Griffin of $500,000 for each of the first five years, with rent for subsequent years determined in accordance with the Imperial Lease. The Imperial Lease also grants Monrovia an option to purchase the land, land improvements and other operating assets that were used by Imperial in its Connecticut growing operations, during the first thirteen years of the lease period for $10.5 million, or $7.0 million if only a certain portion of the land is purchased, subject in each case to certain adjustments as provided for in the Imperial Lease. 

Imperial's Florida farm is also being leased to another private company grower of landscape nursery plants. Imperial shut down its growing operations on its Florida farm in fiscal 2009 and entered into a six year lease of that facility. The lease, with annual rent of $600,000 during its last three years, was scheduled to terminate on July 31, 2015. In June 2015, the tenant exercised its option under the lease to purchase the facility and paid a deposit of $400,000 to Griffin. However, the tenant subsequently informed Griffin that it would not close on the purchase. Griffin and the tenant then entered into a Holdover and Settlement Agreement that permitted the tenant to continue to occupy the farm through April 2016 at an agreed upon rate and Griffin to retain the deposit. Griffin expects to seek a sale or lease of the Florida farm at the conclusion of the tenant's occupancy. 

Investments 

Centaur Media plc 

Centaur Media plc ("Centaur Media") is a publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange. As of November 30, 2015, Griffin held 1,952,462 shares of Centaur Media and accounts for its investment in Centaur Media as an available-for-sale security. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of Griffin's investment in Centaur Media, including both changes in the stock price and changes in the foreign currency exchange rate, are not included in Griffin's net income but are included in Griffin's other comprehensive income. In fiscal 2014, Griffin sold 500,000 shares of its Centaur Media common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $566,000. Griffin did not sell any of its stock in Centaur Media in fiscal 2015. 

Shemin Nurseries Holding Corp. 

Shemin Nurseries Holding Corp. ("SNHC") is a privately held company that operates a landscape nursery distribution business. At the beginning of fiscal 2013, Griffin held an approximately 14% equity interest in SNHC and accounted for its investment in SNHC under the cost method of accounting for investments. In fiscal 2013, Griffin sold its entire investment in SNHC for cash proceeds of approximately $3.4 million. 

Employees 

As of November 30, 2015, Griffin employed 34 people on a full-time basis. Presently, none of Griffin's employees are represented by a union. Griffin believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory. 

Competition 

Numerous real estate developers operate in the portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts and the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania in which Griffin's real estate holdings are concentrated. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin. Griffin's real estate business competes on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities. 

Regulation: Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate properly such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real estate properties, Griffin may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. The value of Griffin's land may be affected by the presence of residual chemicals from the prior use of the land for farming, principally on a portion of the land that is intended for residential use. In the event that Griffin is unable to remediate adequately any of its land intended for residential use, Griffin's ability to develop such property for its intended purposes would be materially affected. 

Griffin periodically reviews its properties for the purpose of evaluating such properties' compliance with applicable state and federal environmental laws. In connection with the Imperial Transaction, Griffin has incurred a small amount of costs to remediate a small area of the Connecticut farm that is leased to Monrovia under the Imperial Lease. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Griffin is in discussions with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection ("DEEP") regarding the recent findings of exceedances of certain residual pesticides on a limited portion of the Connecticut farm being leased to Monrovia. At this time, Griffin does not anticipate experiencing, in the next twelve months, any material expense in complying with such laws. Griffin may incur remediation costs in the future in connection with its development operations. Such costs are not expected to be significant as compared to expected proceeds from development projects or property sales.
