 Item 1. Business. General 

&#160; 

First Community Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1994 primarily to own and control all of the capital stock of First Community Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;), which commenced operations in August 1995. The Bank&#146;s primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;). The Bank is also regulated and examined by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (the &#147;S.C. Board&#148;). 

&#160; 

We engage in a commercial banking business from our main office in Lexington, South Carolina and our 15 full-service offices located in the Midlands of South Carolina to include: Lexington County (6), Richland County (4), Newberry County (2) and Kershaw County (1) and the Central Savannah River area to include: Aiken County (1) and Augusta (1) which is located in Richmond County, Georgia. We offer a wide-range of traditional banking products and services for professionals and small-to medium-sized businesses, including consumer and commercial, mortgage, brokerage and investment, and insurance services. We also offer online banking to our customers. 

&#160; 

We have grown organically and through acquisitions. On September 26, 2014, the Bank completed its acquisition of approximately $40 million in deposits and $8.7 million in loans from First South Bank (&#147;First South&#148;). This represented all of the deposits and a portion of the loans at First South&#146;s Columbia, South Carolina banking office located at 1333 Main Street. The Bank paid a premium of $714 thousand for the deposits and loans acquired. The deposits and loans from First South were consolidated into the Bank&#146;s branch located at 1213 Lady Street, Columbia, South Carolina. The premium paid of $714 thousand plus fair value adjustments recorded on loans and deposits acquired resulted in a core deposit intangible of $365.9 thousand and other identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $538.6 thousand. 

&#160; 

On February 1, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Savannah River Financial Corporation (&#147;Savannah River&#148;) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Savannah River Banking Company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Savannah River shareholders received either $11.00 in cash or 1.0618 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, or a combination thereof, for each Savannah River share they owned immediately prior to the merger, subject to the limitation that 60% of the outstanding shares of Savannah River common stock were exchanged for cash and 40% of the outstanding shares of Savannah River common stock were exchanged for shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company issued 1,274,330 shares of common stock in the merger. This acquisition added two additional branches to our branch network, one located in Aiken, South Carolina and the other in Augusta, Georgia. 

&#160;

The Bank expanded its residential mortgage business unit with the acquisition of the assets of Palmetto South Mortgage Corporation (&#147;Palmetto South&#148;), effective July 31, 2011. The Palmetto South business has been consolidated into our legacy mortgage group known as First Community Mortgage, a division of First Community Bank. First Community Mortgage offers mortgage loan products for home purchase or refinance in the South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia market areas. During the second quarter of 2006, we completed our acquisition of DeKalb Bankshares, Inc., the holding company for The Bank of Camden. On October 1, 2004, we completed our acquisition of DutchFork Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Newberry Federal Savings Bank.

&#160; 

Location and Service Area 

&#160; 

The Bank is engaged in a general commercial and retail banking business, emphasizing the needs of small-to-medium sized businesses, professional concerns and individuals, primarily in Richland, Lexington, Kershaw and Newberry Counties of South Carolina and the surrounding areas. These counties, which we refer to as the &#147;Midlands&#148; region of South Carolina, had an estimated aggregate population of 780,398 1 and total deposits of approximately $17.6 billion as of June 30, 2015 2 . Lexington County, which is home to six of our Bank&#146;s branch offices, had a population of 277,888 and total deposits of $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2015, approximately $288 million, or 41.9%, of our total deposits were located in Lexington County. Richland County, in which we have four branches, is the second largest county in South Carolina with a population of 401,566 and total deposits of $13.0 billion as of June 30, 2015. Columbia, which is located within Richland County, is South Carolina&#146;s capital city and is geographically positioned in the center of the state between the industrialized Upstate region of South Carolina and the coastal city of Charleston. Intersected by three major interstate highways (I-20, I-77 and I-26), Columbia&#146;s strategic location has contributed greatly to its commercial appeal and growth. With the acquisition of Savannah River we added a branch in Aiken, South Carolina and a branch in Augusta, Georgia (Richmond County). The three-county area of Aiken County (South Carolina), Richmond County (Georgia) and Columbia County (Georgia), which we refer to as the Central Savannah River Area market (CSRA), had an aggregate estimated population of 505,376. Aiken County, which has one Bank branch office, had a population of 164,753 and total deposits of $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The Augusta Branch is located in Richmond County which has a population of 201,366 and total deposits of $3.4 billion. 

&#160; 

We believe that we serve attractive banking markets with long-term growth potential and a well educated employment base that helps to support our diverse and relatively stable local economy. According to 2010 U.S. Census Data, Aiken, Richmond, Lexington, Richland, Kershaw and Newberry counties had median household incomes of $44,509, $37,749, $54,069, $48,359, $43,765 and $41,718, respectively, compared to $44,779 for South Carolina and $49,179 for Georgia as a whole. The principal components of the economy within our market areas are service industries, government and education, and wholesale and retail trade. The largest employers in the Midlands market area, each of which employs in excess of 3,000 people, are Fort Jackson Army Base, the University of South Carolina, Palmetto Health Alliance, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Lexington Medical Center. The largest employers in our CSRA market area, each of which employs in excess of 3,000 people, are Fort Gordon Army Base, Georgia Regents University, Georgia Regents Health System, University Hospital and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions. The Company believes that this diversified economic base has reduced, and will likely continue to reduce, economic volatility in our market areas. Our markets have experienced steady economic and population growth over the past 10 years, and we expect that the area, as well as the service industry needed to support it, will continue to grow. 

&#160; 

Banking Services 

&#160; 

We offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and thrift institutions, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to our principal market area at rates competitive to those offered in the area. In addition, we offer certain retirement account services, such as Individual Retirement Accounts (&#147;IRAs&#148;). All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount allowed by law (currently, $250,000, subject to aggregation rules). 

&#160; 

&#160;

1 All population data is derived from July 2014 estimates based on survey changes to 2010 U.S. Census data. 2 All deposit data as of June 30, 2015 is derived from the most recent data published by the FDIC. 5

&#160;

We also offer a full range of commercial and personal loans. Commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements), and the purchase of equipment and machinery. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education, and personal investments. We also make real estate construction and acquisition loans. We originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans, substantially all of which are sold into the secondary market. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. While differing limits apply in certain circumstances based on the type of loan or the nature of the borrower (including the borrower&#146;s relationship to the bank), in general, we are subject to a loans-to-one-borrower limit of an amount equal to 15% of the Bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and surplus, or 25% of the unimpaired capital and surplus if the excess over 15% is approved by the board of directors of the Bank and is fully secured by readily marketable collateral. As a result, our lending limit will increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in the Bank&#146;s level of capital. Based upon the capitalization of the Bank at December 31, 2015, the maximum amount we could lend to one borrower is $13.1 million. In addition, we may not make any loans to any director, officer, employee, or 10% shareholder of the Company or the Bank unless the loan is approved by our board of directors and is made on terms not more favorable to such person than would be available to a person not affiliated with the Bank. 

&#160; 

Other bank services include internet banking, cash management services, safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, and automatic drafts for various accounts. We offer non-deposit investment products and other investment brokerage services through a registered representative with an affiliation through LPL Financial. We are associated with Jeannie, Star, and Plus networks of automated teller machines and MasterCard debit cards that may be used by our customers throughout South Carolina and other regions. We also offer VISA and MasterCard credit card services through a correspondent bank as our agent. 

&#160; 

We currently do not exercise trust powers, but we can begin to do so with the prior approval of our primary banking regulators, the FDIC and the S.C. Board. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The banking business is highly competitive. We compete as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and money market mutual funds operating in Richland, Lexington, Kershaw and Newberry Counties and elsewhere. As of June 30, 2015, there were 25 financial institutions operating approximately 193 offices in Lexington, Richland, Kershaw and Newberry Counties. With the acquisition of Savannah River Financial Corporation we added a branch in Aiken, South Carolina and one in Augusta, Georgia. These two counties, along with Columbia County which is contiguous to Richmond County, make up the area we refer to as CSRA market. There are 17 financial institutions in the CSRA market operating 108 branches. The competition among the various financial institutions is based upon a variety of factors, including interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, credit and service charges, the quality of services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities and, in the case of loans to large commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Size gives larger banks certain advantages in competing for business from large corporations. These advantages include higher lending limits and the ability to offer services in other areas of South Carolina. As a result, we do not generally attempt to compete for the banking relationships of large corporations, but concentrate our efforts on small-to-medium sized businesses and individuals. We believe we have competed effectively in this market by offering quality and personal service. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks. 

&#160; 

Market Share 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2015, the most recent date for which market data is available, total deposits in the Bank&#146;s primary market area, Lexington, Richland, Kershaw and Newberry Counties, were over $17.6 billion. At June 30, 2015, our deposits represented 3.30% of the market. As of June 30, 2015, the CSRA market had total deposits of $7.2 billion and our branch deposits represented 1.48% of the market. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 186 full-time employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 

&#160;

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

Both the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control, or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future. 

&#160; 

We own 100% of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank, and, therefore, we are considered to be a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#147;Bank Holding Company Act&#148;). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the &#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) under the Bank Holding Company Act and its regulations promulgated there under. Moreover, as a bank holding company of a bank located in South Carolina, we also are subject to the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act impacts financial institutions in numerous ways, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; The creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council responsible for monitoring and managing systemic risk, &#9679; Granting additional authority to the Federal Reserve to regulate certain types of nonbank financial companies, &#9679; Granting new authority to the FDIC as liquidator and receiver, &#9679; Changing the manner in which deposit insurance assessments are made, &#9679; Requiring regulators to modify capital standards, &#9679; Establishing the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#147;CFPB&#148;), &#9679; Capping interchange fees that banks with assets of $10 billion or more charge merchants for debit card transactions, &#9679; Imposing more stringent requirements on mortgage lenders, and &#9679; Limiting banks&#146; proprietary trading activities. &#160; 

There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. While some have been issued, many remain to be issued. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Basel Capital Standards. Regulatory capital rules released by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on &#147;advanced approaches&#148; banking organizations, which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, with $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime. The new regulatory capital rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions), and all of the requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

The rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us: 

&#160; 

&#9679; a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; &#9679; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement); &#9679; a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and &#9679; a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement). 7

&#160;

Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rules have disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt-out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

&#160; 

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. As of January 1, 2016, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 0.625%, increasing by that amount each successive year until 2019. 

&#160; 

In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule . Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the &#147;Volcker Rule,&#148; prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as &#147;banking entities&#148;) from engaging in two types of activities: &#147;proprietary trading&#148; and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as &#147;covered funds.&#148; Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity&#146;s own account. Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the SEC because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, our primary federal regulators, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, together with other federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2015, the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds. 

&#160; 

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action . From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Company. 

&#160; 

Permitted Activities. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in, the following activities: 

&#160; 

&#9679; banking or managing or controlling banks; &#160; 

&#9679; furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and &#160; 

&#9679; any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 8

&#160;

Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: 

&#160; 

&#9679; factoring accounts receivable; &#160; 

&#9679; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; &#160; 

&#9679; leasing personal or real property; &#160; 

&#9679; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; &#160; 

&#9679; trust company functions; &#160; 

&#9679; financial and investment advisory activities; &#160; 

&#9679; conducting discount securities brokerage activities; &#160; 

&#9679; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; &#160; 

&#9679; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; &#160; 

&#9679; performing selected data processing services and support services; &#160; 

&#9679; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and &#160; 

&#9679; performing selected insurance underwriting activities. &#160; 

As a bank holding company, we also can elect to be treated as a &#147;financial holding company,&#148; which would allow us to engage in a broader array of activities. In sum, a financial holding company can engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities, including insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities, providing financial and investment advisory services, underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities. We have not sought financial holding company status, but may elect such status in the future as our business matures. If we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status, each insured depository institution we control would have to be well capitalized, well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;) (discussed below). 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company&#146;s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Change in Control. Two statutes, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated under them, require some form of regulatory review before any company may acquire &#147;control&#148; of a bank or a bank holding company. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, control is deemed to exist if a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company; controls the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors; or exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company. In guidance issued in 2008, the Federal Reserve has stated that an investor generally will not be viewed as having a controlling influence over a bank holding company when the investor holds, in aggregate, less than 33% of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company (voting and nonvoting equity), provided such investor&#146;s ownership does not include 15% or more of any class of voting securities. Prior Federal Reserve approval is necessary before an entity acquires sufficient control to become a bank holding company. Natural persons, certain non-business trusts, and other entities are not treated as companies (or bank holding companies), and their acquisitions are not subject to review under the Bank Holding Company Act. State laws generally, including South Carolina law, require state approval before an acquirer may become the holding company of a state bank. 

&#160; 

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a person or company is generally required to file a notice with the Federal Reserve if it will, as a result of the transaction, own or control 10% or more of any class of voting securities or direct the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company and either if the bank or bank holding company has registered securities or if the acquirer would be the largest holder of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. For a change in control at the holding company level, both the Federal Reserve and the subsidiary bank&#146;s primary federal regulator must approve the change in control; at the bank level, only the bank&#146;s primary federal regulator is involved. Transactions subject to the Bank Holding Company Act are exempt from Change in Control Act requirements. For state banks, state laws, including that of South Carolina, typically require approval by the state bank regulator as well. 

&#160;

Source of Strength. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed by law and regulatory policy on bank holding companies with regard to their depository institution subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event that the depository institution becomes in danger of defaulting under its obligations to repay deposits. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;), to avoid receivership of its insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become &#147;undercapitalized&#148; within the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution&#146;s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the Bank Holding Company Act to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve&#146;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal law grants federal bank regulatory authorities&#146; additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution&#146;s financial condition. 

&#160; 

In addition, the &#147;cross guarantee&#148; provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#147;FDIA&#148;) require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the FDIC as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC&#146;s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions. 

&#160; 

The FDIA also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or shareholder. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and shareholders in the event a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of our Bank. 

&#160; 

Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on the bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of &#147;qualifying&#148; capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described below under &#147;First Community Bank&#8212;Capital Regulations.&#148; Subject to our capital requirements and certain other restrictions, we are able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to the Company. Our ability to pay dividends depends on, among other things, the Bank&#146;s ability to pay dividends to us, which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in &#147;First Community Bank&#8212;Dividends.&#148; We are also able to raise capital for contribution to the Bank by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws. 

&#160; 

Dividends . Since the Company is a bank holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal and state regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve&#146;s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization&#146;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve&#146;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. In addition, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

&#160;

In addition, since the Company is legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in &#147;First Community Bank &#8211; Dividends.&#148; 

&#160; 

South Carolina State Regulation. As a South Carolina bank holding company under the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, we are subject to limitations on sale or merger and to regulation by the S.C. Board. We are not required to obtain the approval of the S.C. Board prior to acquiring the capital stock of a national bank, but we must notify them at least 15 days prior to doing so. We must receive the S.C. Board&#146;s approval prior to engaging in the acquisition of a South Carolina state chartered bank or another South Carolina bank holding company. 

&#160; 

First Community Bank 

&#160; 

As a South Carolina state bank, the Bank&#146;s primary federal regulator is the FDIC and the Bank is also regulated and examined by the S.C. Board. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount of $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. 

&#160; 

The S.C. Board and the FDIC regulate or monitor virtually all areas of the Bank&#146;s operations, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; security devices and procedures; &#9679; adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves; &#9679; loans; &#9679; investments; &#9679; borrowings; &#9679; deposits; &#9679; mergers; &#9679; issuances of securities; &#9679; payment of dividends; &#9679; interest rates payable on deposits; &#9679; interest rates or fees chargeable on loans; &#9679; establishment of branches; &#9679; corporate reorganizations; &#9679; maintenance of books and records; and &#9679; adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices. &#160; 

These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank&#146;s operations, extensively regulate various aspects of our banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of reserves on demand deposit liabilities, and the safety and soundness of our banking practices. 

&#160; 

All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate federal banking agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC, their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The FDIC and the other federal banking regulatory agencies also have issued standards for all insured depository institutions relating, among other things, to the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; internal controls; &#9679; information systems and audit systems; &#9679; loan documentation; &#9679; credit underwriting; &#9679; interest rate risk exposure; and &#9679; asset quality. 11

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action. The FDICIA established a &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; program in which every bank is placed in one of five regulatory categories, depending primarily on its regulatory capital levels. The FDIC and the other federal banking regulators are permitted to take increasingly severe action as a bank&#146;s capital position or financial condition declines below the &#147;Adequately Capitalized&#148; level described below. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a bank&#146;s leverage ratio reaches two percent. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The FDIC&#146;s regulations set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences. The categories are: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Well Capitalized &#8212; The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized institution (i) has total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. &#160; 

&#9679; Adequately Capitalized &#8212; The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. No capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. &#160; 

&#9679; Undercapitalized &#8212; The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or greater, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. &#160; 

&#9679; Significantly Undercapitalized &#8212; The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or greater, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. &#160; 

&#9679; Critically Undercapitalized &#8212; The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. &#160; 

If the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the bank to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition. 

&#160; 

If a bank is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, a bank that is not well capitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over interest paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity in such institution&#146;s normal market area for deposits accepted from within its normal market area, or national rate paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity for deposits accepted outside the bank&#146;s normal market area. Moreover, the FDIC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be categorized as undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations (an undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action) and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#146;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution&#146;s total assets at the time it became categorized as undercapitalized or the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is categorized as significantly undercapitalized. 

&#160;

Significantly undercapitalized categorized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become categorized as adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities. 

&#160; 

An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution, would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if payment of such a management fee or the making of such would cause a bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a management fee or dividend to the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was deemed to be &#147;well capitalized.&#148; 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The FDIA also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; and (v) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the FDIC. The final regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Examination . The FDIC also requires the Bank to prepare annual reports on the Bank&#146;s financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of its financial affairs in compliance with its minimum standards and procedures. 

&#160; 

All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate federal banking agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC, their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating, among other things, to the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; internal controls; &#9679; information systems and audit systems; &#9679; loan documentation; &#9679; credit underwriting; &#9679; interest rate risk exposure; and &#9679; asset quality. &#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Company and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W. 

&#160; 

Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank&#146;s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank&#146;s capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate. 

&#160;

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. If there are no comparable transactions, a bank&#146;s (or one of its subsidiaries&#146;) affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies. These requirements apply to all transactions subject to Section 23A as well as to certain other transactions. 

&#160; 

The affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank, any other company under common control with the bank (including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank), any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank, any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank, any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate, and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the bank&#146;s affiliates. Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates. 

&#160; 

The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal stockholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit include derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider. Any extension of credit to an insider (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 

&#160; 

Dividends. The Company&#146;s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank&#146;s payment of dividends to the Company. As a South Carolina chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. Unless otherwise instructed by the S.C. Board, the Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the S.C. Board. The FDIC also has the authority under federal law to enjoin a bank from engaging in what in its opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business, including the payment of a dividend under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

Branching. Federal legislation permits out-of-state acquisitions by bank holding companies, interstate branching by banks, and interstate merging by banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which was signed into law in July 2010 and is discussed more fully below (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), removed previous state law restrictions on de novo interstate branching in states such as South Carolina and Georgia. This change effectively permits out of state banks to open de novo branches in states where the laws of such state would permit a bank chartered by that sate to open a de novo branch. 

&#160; 

Anti-Tying Restrictions . Under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible: a bank may offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products; and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. A bank holding company or any bank affiliate also is subject to anti-tying requirements in connection with electronic benefit transfer services. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires that the FDIC evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on our Bank. 

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#147;GLBA&#148;) made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made available to a bank&#146;s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. 

&#160; 

Financial Subsidiaries. Under the GLBA, subject to certain conditions imposed by their respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered banks are permitted to form &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that may conduct financial or incidental activities, thereby permitting bank subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were impermissible. The GLBA imposes several safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the parent bank&#146;s equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from the bank&#146;s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the bank&#146;s capital adequacy. In addition, the GLBA imposes new restrictions on transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions between banks and non-bank affiliates. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Regulations. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank&#146;s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as: 

&#160; 

&#9679; the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; &#9679; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; &#9679; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; &#9679; the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; &#9679; the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and &#9679; the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. &#160; 

The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to: 

&#160; 

&#9679; the FDIA, which, among other things, limits the amount of deposit insurance available per account to $250,000 and imposes other limits on deposit-taking; &#9679; the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; &#9679; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#146; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and &#9679; the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires depository institutions to provide disclosures so that consumers can make meaningful comparisons about depository institutions and accounts. &#160; 

Enforcement Powers. The Bank and its &#147;institution-affiliated parties,&#148; including its management, employee&#146;s agent&#146;s independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants, and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution&#146;s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to twenty years. In addition, regulators are provided with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, banking agencies&#146; powers to issue cease-and-desist orders have been expanded. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate. 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering . Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The Company and the Bank are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and &#147;knowing your customer&#148; in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;), enacted in 2001 and renewed through 2019. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing cease and desist orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 

&#160;

USA PATRIOT Act/Bank Secrecy Act. Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The USA PATRIOT Act, amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (i) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (ii) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (iii) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the U.S. Treasury Department&#146;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (iv) filing suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations and requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. 

&#160; 

On February 18, 2015, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and / to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC consenting to the issuance by the FDIC of a Consent Order (the &#147;Consent Order&#148;). The Consent Order required the Bank to take certain actions with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws and regulations (collectively referred to as the &#147;BSA&#148;), including, among other things, enhancing its annual BSA risk assessment processes; revising certain internal controls related to BSA; and further developing and implementing certain BSA-related training programs. The Bank took immediate actions to correct and resolve all of the BSA issues included in the Consent Order and, on January 28, 2016, the FDIC advised the Bank that the Consent Order had been terminated. 

&#160; 

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (&#147;FBI&#148;) can send to the banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. The Bank can be requested, to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must file a suspicious activity report and contact the FBI. 

&#160; 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;), which is a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the &#147;Treasury&#148;), is responsible for helping to insure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with &#147;enemies&#148; of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the FBI. The Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. The Bank performs these checks utilizing software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. 

&#160; 

Privacy, Data Security and Credit Reporting. Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. It is the Bank&#146;s policy not to disclose any personal information unless required by law. 

&#160; 

Recent cyber attacks against banks and other institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the Federal banking agencies to issue several warnings and extensive guidance on cyber security. The agencies are likely to devote more resources to this part of their safety and soundness examination than they have in the past. 

&#160;

In addition, pursuant to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the &#147;FACT Act&#148;) and the implementing regulations of the federal banking agencies and Federal Trade Commission, the Bank is required to have in place an &#147;identity theft red flags&#148; program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. The Bank has implemented an identity theft red flags program designed to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the joint final rules. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations. 

&#160; 

Check 21. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act gives &#147;substitute checks,&#148; such as a digital image of a check and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. Some of the major provisions include: 

&#160; 

&#9679; allowing check truncation without making it mandatory; &#9679; demanding that every financial institution communicate to accountholders in writing a description of its substitute check processing program and their rights under the law; &#9679; legalizing substitutions for and replacements of paper checks without agreement from consumers; &#9679; retaining in place the previously mandated electronic collection and return of checks between financial institutions only when individual agreements are in place; &#9679; requiring that when accountholders request verification, financial institutions produce the original check (or a copy that accurately represents the original) and demonstrate that the account debit was accurate and valid; and &#9679; requiring the re-crediting of funds to an individual&#146;s account on the next business day after a consumer proves that the financial institution has erred. &#160; 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies. Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve&#146;s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. On December 16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points, which was the first increase in several years. Further increases may occur in 2016, but, if so, there is no announced timetable. 

&#160; 

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the bank&#146;s regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

&#160; 

FDIC insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. The Financing Corporation quarterly assessment for the fourth quarter of 2014 equaled 1.725 basis points for each $100 of average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. 

&#160; 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank&#146;s deposit insurance. 

&#160;

Incentive Compensation . In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and certain other federal agencies to jointly issue a regulation on incentive compensation. The agencies proposed such a rule in 2011, which reflects the 2010 guidance, but the agencies have not finalized the rule as of December 31, 2015.
