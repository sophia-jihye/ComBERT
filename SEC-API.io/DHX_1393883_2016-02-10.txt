2015 Highlights 

2015 Progress on Key Strategic Goals: Path of Innovation, Integration and Evolution 

In 2015, we made significant progress against our key strategic goals. Our path of innovation, integration and evolution continues, and many of our new and emerging products and services are gaining traction. Across all of our businesses we&#8217;ve made great strides in elevating our product, our people and our processes, which are leading to increased engagement with our customers and professionals, greater affinity with our brands, and deeper client relationships. 

Company Profile 

DHI was incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2005. DHI is a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through our specialized services for professional communities including technology and security clearance, financial services, energy, healthcare and hospitality. Each of our services is tailored for the specific industry or profession it serves. We focus on delivering three key value propositions: 

&#8226; 

Providing the most efficient solution for recruiters and employers; 

&#8226; 

Delivering the most relevant career content in our verticals; and 

&#8226; 

Utilizing data and analytics to deliver specialized insights. 

&#32;5 

The majority of our revenues today are generated through the sale of recruitment packages, which allow customers to post jobs and source candidates through our resume databases and, in the case of Dice, Dice Europe and eFinancialCareers to utilize our Open Web service for an additional fee. Recruitment packages are typically provided through contractual arrangements with annual, monthly or interim terms. 

Our Products and Services 

We help organizations find the best talent, and we help professionals find the best jobs and advance their careers. We do this through a number of products, including: 

&#8226; 

Resume databases. &#32;&#32;Each of our brands provides powerful, detailed searches of a large number of candidate resumes. Showing customers the right talent makes their recruiting efforts more efficient. 

&#8226; 

Job postings. Because our job collections are focused on specific verticals, professionals searching for jobs can easily find jobs that are most relevant to them. In turn, the applications received by our customers are more likely to be relevant and qualified compared to applications received from generalist sites. Thus, showing professionals the right job postings benefits both the talent and the recruiting organization. 

&#8226; 

Open Web. Our Open Web product searches over 190 social and professional sources to create an aggregated profile of a candidate&#8217;s professional experience, contributions, history and capabilities (as well as their passions and interests). This allows our customers to build broader pools of talent from across the web, gives them deeper insights into talent they discover, and allows them to engage prospective candidates with a differentiated message. 

&#8226; 

Content and data. Each of our services provides tailored content to help professionals manage their careers and provide employers insight into recruiting strategies and trends. In addition, some of our brands offer data products specific to their industries.

&#185; Recruitment packages are a combination of job posting slots and access to our searchable database of candidates (in the case of Dice and Dice Europe, this includes our Open Web Service). Job posting slots allow the customer to post up to a specified number of jobs at a single time. 

Dice &#32;has been a go-to destination for technology and engineering talent in the United States for the past 25 years. The job postings available on Dice, from both technology and non-technology companies across many industries, include positions for software engineers, big data professionals, systems administrators, database specialists, project managers, and a variety of other technology and engineering professionals. Dice had approximately 77,000 job postings as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, Dice in North America had on average 2.3 million monthly unique visitors. 

Customers can purchase recruitment packages, job postings or advertisements. Approximately 87% of Dice revenue was derived from recruitment packages in 2015. Recruitment packages offer our customers the ability to access the candidate resume database, post up to a specified number of jobs at a single time and utilize our Open Web product for an additional fee. Customers are incentivized to purchase our recruitment packages on an annual basis. 

&#32;6 

Professionals can post their resumes, search jobs and access our career-related content, news and tools. Dice recently launched Skill Center, a tool that uses data aggregated from across the web to show skill trends, giving professionals insights into potential skills gaps and development areas. 

Dice entered the European market in 2013 through the acquisition of The IT Job Board, a leading technology career site for the UK and Continental Europe. In 2015, we rebranded The IT Job Board to Dice. Our Open Web service is available to Dice Europe customers for an additional fee. In Europe, Dice had approximately 19,000 job postings as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, Dice Europe had on average 375,000 monthly unique visitors. 

ClearanceJobs &#32;is a leading Internet-based career network dedicated to matching security-cleared professionals with the best hiring companies searching for employees. Authorized U.S. government contractors, federal agencies, national laboratories and universities utilize The Cleared Network to quickly and easily find candidates with specific, active security clearance requirements to fill open jobs in a range of disciplines. The majority of candidates with resumes in our database have high-level security clearance. ClearanceJobs had approximately 11,500 job postings as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, ClearanceJobs had on average 305,000 monthly unique visitors. 

eFinancialCareers &#32;is the world&#8217;s leading financial services careers website, operating websites in multiple markets in four languages mainly across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and North America.

Recruitment package customers may purchase Open Web for an additional fee. eFinancialCareers had approximately 9,300 job postings as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, eFinancialCareers had on average 1.5 million monthly unique visitors. 

Rigzone &#32;is a leading website dedicated to delivering online content, data, and career services in the oil and gas industry in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Oil and gas companies, as well as companies that serve the energy industry, use Rigzone to find talent for roles such as petroleum engineers, sales professionals with energy industry expertise and skilled tradesmen. In addition to recruitment packages and advertising, Rigzone provides a number of data services products including Riglogix, RigVantage and RigOutlook. OilCareers, a leading recruitment site for oil and gas professionals in Europe, was integrated into Rigzone in March 2015. Rigzone had approximately 3,000 job postings as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, Rigzone had on average 1.4 million monthly unique visitors.

BrightMatter &#32;was formed in October 2015 as a new division focusing on a number of next-generation recruitment products and services that will be applicable across DHI brands. This division brought together the operations of WorkDigital and getTalent as well as other product initiatives. WorkDigital is the technology group that developed the underlying technology for our Open Web products, and it is currently developing new applications of that technology, including the FreshUp service as well as workforce analytics products for our talent acquisition brands. getTalent is a Software as a Service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) talent sourcing management and engagement tool. getTalent expands the overall market opportunity for DHI brands beyond traditional Talent Acquisition products and services. 

&#32;7 

Our Industry 

We primarily operate in the talent discovery and acquisition segment of the broader market for human capital management services through vertically-oriented career sites. We believe that the overall demand for talent acquisition and career development products and services has significant long-term growth potential. Over the next decade, the aging labor force of the United States is expected to lead to a labor supply-demand imbalance as baby-boomers retire. We believe that international economies show similar trends, with an aging labor force in Europe and shortages of skilled professionals to meet the demand of developing economies in Asia. 

We also believe that certain industries that employ highly-skilled and highly-paid professionals will experience particularly strong demand for effective recruiting solutions due to the scarcity of such professionals. For example, as of December 2015, the seasonally unadjusted U.S. unemployment rate was 2.6% for computer-related occupations, 2.6% in the finance sector, and 3.2% in the healthcare sector, as compared to the overall national average of 5.0%, seasonally adjusted. Historically, the unemployment rate for college graduates has been lower than the unemployment rate for the U.S. overall. As of December 2015, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for college graduates was 2.3%. 

We believe that there are five major trends that will continue to shape demand for talent acquisition services: 

&#8226; 

Greater competition for professional talent . &#32;The candidate-employer relationship has changed, with the balance of power shifting towards the candidates. The length of time to fill positions is an indicator of the availability of qualified talent in the labor market. Our proprietary indicator of time to fill an open position, the DHI-DFH Vacancy Duration Measure, indicates that the mean time to fill a position was 27.6 working days in October 2015, up from 22.1 in October 2012. In addition, our December 2015 Hiring Survey found that 47% of hiring managers cannot fill spots due to salary requirements. 

&#8226; 

Sourcing of talent will become more mainstream. &#32;Companies are increasingly engaging in ongoing sourcing to build robust candidate pools for both &#8220;just in time&#8221; candidates as well as future hiring needs. This means recruiters must proactively identify and build relationships with professionals ahead of the creation of a specific job opening. Our December 2015 Hiring Survey shows that nearly three-quarters (74%) of companies say sourcing and building a bench of talent is more important today than a year ago. Complementing this trend is an increased interest in sourcing analytics, recruiting marketing, and employment branding. 

&#8226; 

Continued professional interest in career brands specific to industry and skills. &#32;Our services focus on domains or industries that require specialized skills and knowledge and, thus, customized content, profiles and search parameters. In addition, the professionals in our verticals often share a sense of personal identity and community that goes beyond the confines of their careers. We believe that both specialized skills and the sense of personal identity and community lead professionals in our verticals to prefer specialized career brands over generalist ones. 

&#8226; 

Talent attraction and retention becoming more of a strategic priority for companies. &#32;According to the Aberdeen Group, in 2014, 79% of companies identify their main talent acquisition pressure as a shortage of critical skills available in the labor pool, up from 55% in 2012. Similarly, the PWC 2015 US CEO Survey &#32;found that 34% of U.S. CEOs are &#8216;extremely concerned&#8217; about the availability of key skills as a threat to their organizations&#8217; growth prospects (an additional 44% are &#8216;somewhat concerned&#8217;). In this environment where top talent is hard to find, organizations are increasingly prioritizing retention of talent. According to Deloitte&#8217;s Global Human Capital Trends 2015 , 66% of human resources respondents reported that they are updating their engagement and retention strategies. 

&#8226; 

Increased &#32; use of data and analytics in human capital management and increased need for insights. &#32;As many companies prove the power of analytics in marketing and other business domains, organizations are seeking to gain a competitive advantage by applying data-driven insights to improve their hiring, retention and leadership capabilities. According to Deloitte&#8217;s Global Human Capital Trends 2015 , 75% of surveyed companies believe that using people analytics is &#8216;important&#8217;. 

In this environment, we believe there is an opportunity for career management and talent acquisition tools that leverage the common interests, goals and skills of select professional communities. We believe that a focus on professional communities allows organizations to more efficiently identify talent, with more complete data and insights about that talent. 

Our Value Proposition 

We have become a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections by focusing on professional communities that share common interests, goals and skills. We believe that this focus has allowed us to build valuable talent pools with the most complete and relevant information. In turn, that means organizations can get to that talent faster, more efficiently and with better data and insights about that talent. By providing a large number of employment opportunities and original and community-shared career-related content for professionals, we encourage the use of our websites and continue to 

&#32;8 

attract professionals to our services. We believe these factors have helped us to achieve a critical mass of both customers and professionals, contributing to the attractiveness and efficiency of our online marketplaces. 

Benefits we provide to Professionals 

Relevant employment connections . &#32;When professionals post their resumes or apply for jobs on our websites, they can make valuable connections with organizations who prize their skills and expertise. Professionals can avoid having to &#8220;sort through the clutter&#8221; on generalist career sites, and get the most out of their time by using our more focused services. 

Skills/industry-specific career management tools, information and insights . &#32;We provide professionals with targeted and relevant career development tools, content and news. For example, Dice and ClearanceJobs provide professionals with market and salary information and local market trends. In addition, Dice&#8217;s new Skill Center tool provides data-driven insights on current skills trends by analyzing skills data collected from across the web. eFinancialCareers provides industry-specialized online career content, as well as print and online career guides targeted to college and graduate students. The Rigzone services provide energy industry news from around the globe, detailed salary information, and data services related to the worldwide offshore rig fleet. We believe our career development services and tools provide professionals with the insights they need to propel their careers forward, and thus increase the engagement of professionals with our sites. 

Benefits we provide to our Customers 

Large pools of qualified and hard-to-reach professionals . We seek to improve the efficiency of the recruiting process for our customers by providing quick and easy access to large and fresh pools of highly qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. Because the communities of professionals who visit our websites are highly-skilled and specialized within specific industries, we believe our customers who post jobs receive applications from candidates who are better qualified for the positions, and that they receive fewer irrelevant applications than when using generalist sites. In addition, since our resume data and resume search functions are highly tailored by specialty, we believe that our customers can identify talent using our resume databases more quickly and easily than by using broader services. 

Relevant information on prospective candidates . We believe that the specialized nature of our job posting and resume search products makes them inherently more relevant and efficient for recruiting. In addition, our new Open Web product creates an aggregated profile of a professional&#8217;s experience, contributions, and capabilities as well as their passions and interests. Using all of these products together gives our customers the most complete view of a prospective candidate, and allows them to not only identify the best talent but also tailor their recruiting approach to each individual. 

Our Strategic Goals 

Our goal is to be the leading provider of data, insights and connections through our specialized services for select professional communities. Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term potential of our websites and services. We continue to pursue our goals by pursuing the following strategies: 

Increase the Efficiency, Effectiveness, Value and Relevance in our Core Talent Acquisition Products. In the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, we must continuously enhance the value of our marketplaces through both audience growth and product innovation. 

&#8226; 

Reach new customers and professionals through continued branding, direct marketing and direct sales activities; 

&#8226; 

Enhance, expand and develop additional content, community and career-management features across our websites to increase engagement among professionals; and 

&#8226; 

Build new features and greater efficiencies into our online services through ongoing innovation. 

Develop Deeper, Higher-value Relationships with our Customer and User Bases. We believe our existing installed base of clients and users offer substantial opportunity for growth and, in an effort to leverage this opportunity for growth, will focus on selling additional products to existing clients and fostering client success to drive higher retention. In addition, we believe there is opportunity to foster repeat visitation, improved loyalty and deeper engagement with the professionals who already use our services. 

&#8226; 

Enhance current product offerings with more actionable data and greater depth of analysis; 

&#8226; 

Deepen our relationships with and expand the services - such as Open Web, Sourcing Concierge and Branding products - we sell to our existing customers; 

&#8226; 

Offer new products and services that make recruiters more effective; and 

&#32;9 

&#8226; 

Help professionals throughout their career lifecycle by creating new products and services geared towards personalized career management. 

Enter the Sourcing Management Market with a Unique Combination of Acquisition, Sourcing and Management, and Pipelining. We believe we can add more value to the sourcing and recruiting process by extending our offerings so that they allow organizations not only to discover and access professional talent, but also interact and maintain relationships with prospective candidates over time. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Plan to launch in 2016, the next generation version of getTalent, a strategic talent pipelining, engagement and analytics SaaS solution that was in beta testing throughout 2015; and 

&#8226; 

Launch versions of Open Web in other verticals. 

Pursue International Expansion in Select Verticals. We believe that recruiting is increasingly becoming global, and we intend to continue to evaluate and selectively pursue international opportunities to better serve our existing customers and to further expand our business outside of the United States. 

Marketing and Sales 

We focus our long-term marketing efforts on growing the number of professionals who visit and engage with our websites, which we believe increases the attractiveness of our websites to our customers. We use a combination of direct marketing, branding and communications initiatives to increase our brand awareness, traffic, new resumes posted and applications to job postings. We primarily engage in search engine marketing, online advertising, participation in industry events, social media marketing and content marketing. Many of our brands use strategic alliances with relevant publishers, trade associations and industry groups to increase reach and traffic. Many of our brands have also invested in broader awareness campaigns that include outdoor advertising in select cities where competition for their respective specializations is high. 

Our customer marketing efforts are primarily focused on lead generation activities, such as email and direct mail campaigns and participation in industry events. We also use marketing communications, such as media relations, social media, and thought leadership content, to enhance brand awareness and client relationships. 

We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by brand, market segment, and geography. Our field sales groups target Fortune 1000 companies, large staffing and recruiting firms and other large and mid-size businesses. Our in-house sales teams focus on generating new business from recruiters and small- and mid-size companies, renewing customer contracts, increasing the service levels customers purchase and servicing the needs of our largest clients. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 190 sales personnel in the United States and approximately 80 in the rest of the world. In addition to our internal sales organization, we also use ad networks to help generate ad sales. 

&#32;&#32; We also maintain teams of account managers and customer support specialists who work to ensure customers get the most from our products and services by providing training and assistance. In addition, our customer support departments perform some compliance functions, such as reviewing the websites for false or inaccurate job postings. 

Customers 

We currently serve a diversified customer base consisting of over 16,000 customers in total. No one customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenues in 2015. Our customers include small, mid-sized and large direct employers, staffing companies, recruiting agencies, consulting firms and marketing departments of companies. As of December 31, 2015, notable customers of the Tech &#38; Clearance segment included AT&#38;T, Adecco, Salesforce, Cisco, Apple, Oracle, IBM, Kforce, NCI, Manpower, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, Starbucks, Robert Half, Yahoo, Symantec, and Hewlett Packard. Notable customers of the Finance segment included Robert Half, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, JP Morgan Chase, Bloomberg, Michael Page International, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered Bank. Notable customers of the Energy segment included Schlumberger, Petronas, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Wood Group, Inpex, China Petroleum and Chevron. Notable customers of the Healthcare segment included Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical Center and St Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital. Notable customers of the Hospitality segment included Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and Four Seasons. See item 7 for a description of the segments.

Technology 

We use a variety of technologies to support our websites. Each of our systems is designed so that it can be scaled by provisioning additional resources, adding additional hardware and increasing network capacity. Whenever possible, we host our applications on clustered, high-availability hardware and cloud platforms. Our applications and data connections are monitored 24/7 for performance, responsiveness and stability. 

Currently, our primary technology operations facilities are in co-location data centers in limited access, temperature-controlled environments with emergency power generation capability and service from multiple telecommunications providers, as well as with top-tier cloud providers. Beginning in 2016, we will begin moving our technology operations to a cloud-hosted infrastructure model, which will provide greater business agility and flexibility, improved global delivery capabilities, and improved disaster recovery protection across all services. 

In the current operational model, we maintain backup systems for website operations within our geographically separate recovery data center. We replicate website data at various times throughout the day from the production co-location facility to the recovery data center. In the event of a loss of a data center, we have business resumption technology and offsite data storage capabilities in place. Additionally, we have robust firewalls and switchgear to provide network security, and have used substantial expert assistance in their configuration and testing. 

Competition 

The market for talent acquisition services is highly competitive with multiple online and offline competitors. With the evolution of the online recruiting model, there has been an increasing need to provide ease-of-use and relevance to professionals, as well as an efficient and cost-effective recruitment method for direct employers, recruiters and staffing companies. Additionally, further technological advancements have made it easier for new competitors to emerge with minimal barriers to entry, and advertisers have many alternatives available to reach their target audiences. Our ability to maintain our existing customer base and generate new customers depends to a significant degree on the quality of our candidate bases and audiences, the quality of our services, our ability to enhance our websites and the underlying technology of our websites to meet the needs of a rapidly-evolving marketplace, our pricing strategy and ability to introduce value-added products and services, and our reputation among our customers and potential customers, who are increasingly-sophisticated and demanding. Our competitors include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

social and professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Google; 

&#8226; 

generalist job boards, some of which have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do, such as CareerBuilder, Monster, StepStone, and Seek which, unlike specialized job boards, permit customers to enter into a single contract to find professionals across multiple occupational categories and attempt to fill all of their hiring needs through a single website; 

&#8226; 

aggregators and distributors of job postings and profiles, including SimplyHired, Indeed (owned by Recruit), Talent Bin (owned by Monster Worldwide), Entelo, Gild, ZipRecruiter, Google and Craigslist; 

&#8226; 

career-focused community sites such as Glassdoor; 

&#8226; 

newspaper and magazine publishers, national and regional advertising agencies, executive search firms and search and selection firms that carry classified advertising, many of whom have developed, begun developing or acquired new media capabilities, such as recruitment websites, or have partnered with generalist job boards; 

&#8226; 

specialized services focused specifically on the industries we service, such as FT.com, Oilandgasjobsearch.com (owned by CareerBuilder), Doximity, Upwork, JobServe and Stack Overflow; 

&#8226; 

talent relationship management software providers such as Avature and SmashFly; 

&#8226; 

new and emerging competitors with new business models and products; 

&#8226;

Intellectual Property 

We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of service marks, trademarks, copyrights and other methods of restricting disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information. We have one or more patent applications pending for some of our current services. As we continue to develop and improve our technology, patents may become a more significant part of our intellectual property in the foreseeable future. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and vendors. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. 

&#32;11 

We generally pursue the registration of the material service marks we own in the United States and internationally, as applicable. We own a number of registered, applied for and/or unregistered trademarks and service marks that we use in connection with our businesses. Our trademarks and registered trademarks in the United States and other countries include DICE, CLEARANCEJOBS.COM, RIGZONE.COM, EFINANCIALCAREERS, HEALTHECAREERS NETWORK, and HCAREERS.COM. Registrations for trademarks may be maintained indefinitely, as long as the trademark owner continues to use and police the trademarks and timely renews registrations with the applicable governmental office. Although we generally pursue the registration of our material service marks and other material intellectual property we own, where applicable, we have trademarks and/or service marks that have not been registered in the United States and/or other jurisdictions. We have not registered the copyrights in the content of our websites, and do not intend to register such copyrights. 

The steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and affect our competitive position. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors-Misappropriation or misuse of our intellectual property could harm our reputation, affect our competitive position and cost us money.&#8221;

Regulation and Legislation 

User Privacy 

We collect, store and use a variety of information about both professionals and customers on our website properties. Within the websites, the information that is collected, stored and used has been provided by the professionals or customers with the intent of making it publicly available. We do not ask professionals or customers to supply social security numbers. Our business data is separated from website operations by a variety of security layers including network segmentation, physical and logical access controls, firewalls, and many industry-accepted, best-practice information security controls. 

We post our privacy policies on our websites so that our users can access and understand the terms and conditions applicable to the collection, storage and use of information collected from users. Our privacy policies also disclose the types of information we gather, how we use it and how a user can correct or change their information. Our privacy policies also explain the circumstances under which we share this information and with whom. Professionals who register for our websites have the option of indicating specific areas of interest in which they are willing to receive offers via email or postal mail. These offers contain content created either by us or our third-party partners. 

To protect confidential information and to comply with our obligations to our users, we impose constraints on our customers to whom we provide user data, which are consistent with our commitments to our users. Additionally, when we provide lists to third parties, including to our advertiser customers, it is under contractual terms that are consistent with our obligations to our users and with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#32;12 

U.S. and Foreign Government Regulation 

We are subject to a number of government regulations, both domestic and foreign, that regulate our products and online service offerings, including content, copyright infringement, user privacy, advertising and promotional activities, taxation, access charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations have enacted and also are considering, and may consider in the future, other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet. Areas of potential regulation include, but are not limited to, libel, electronic contracting, pricing, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership. 

There are a number of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online. Certain laws regulate commercial electronic messages. Such laws frequently provide a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establish penalties for the sending of email messages that are not compliant with such laws, including messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content or that do not provide an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipient&#8217;s decision not to receive further commercial emails. 

We are subject to domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies and terms of use agreements describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or terms of use agreements, or privacy-related laws and regulations, could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. The interpretation of these privacy and data protection laws and various regulators&#8217; approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, continue to evolve over time. We face the risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways in different jurisdictions or in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new and unclear laws will be enacted. Complying with these varying domestic and foreign requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users&#8217; privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our products and services and, ultimately, in a loss of customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 

The application of laws and regulations affecting online business to our products and services is often unclear, and these laws and how various jurisdictions interpret these laws continue to evolve. Compliance with these laws may be expensive and could harm our business. Any failure by the Company to comply with these laws and regulations could result in actions against us by governmental authorities or other entities, which could harm our business, including governmental or court orders that we cease certain activities. 

See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors-Our business is subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.&#8221;
