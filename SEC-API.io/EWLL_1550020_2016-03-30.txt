 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

eWellness was incorporated in Nevada in May 2013. Following a share exchange we completed in April 2014, pursuant to which eWellness Corporation, a Nevada corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary, we abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing eWellness Corporation&#8217;s historical businesses and proposed businesses. 

&#160; 

The Company and Nature of Business 

&#160; 

Our business model is to license our PHZIO (&#8220;PHZIO&#8221;) platform to any physical therapy (&#8220;PT&#8221;) clinic in the U.S. and or have large-scale employers use our PHZIO platform as a fully PT monitored corporate wellness program. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s initial licensee is Evolution Physical Therapy (&#8220;EPT&#8221;), which is owned by our CEO, Darwin Fogt, MPT. All treatment revenue for 2015 was reimbursed to EPT, but was not sufficient to generate sales for the Company. The Company is in the process of developing marketing channel partnerships with industry association members, existing software-based telemedicine providers and physical therapy billing and practice management providers. These partnerships, if completed, are anticipated to begin adding third party PT licensee revenue during the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s PHZIO home physical therapy exercise platform has been designed to disrupt the $30 billion physical therapy and the $8 billion corporate wellness industries. PHZIO re-defines the way physical therapy can be delivered. PHZIO is the first real-time remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy platform for home use. Due to the real-time patient monitoring feature, the PHZIO platform is insurance reimbursable by payers such as: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. 

&#160; 

The PHZIO Solution: A New Physical Therapy Delivery System 

&#160; 

&#9679; SaaS technology platform solution for providers bundling rehabilitation services and employer wellness programs; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; First real-time remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy treatment platform for home use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Ability for physical therapists to observe multiple patients simultaneously in real-time; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Solves what has been a structural problem and limitation in post-acute care practice growth. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; PT practices can experiencing 20% higher adherence &#38; compliance rates versus industry standards; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Tracking to 30% increase in net income for a PT practice. &#160;

&#160; 

PHZIO Treatment Session 

The image below illustrates a typical PHZIO treatment session from a patient&#8217;s point of view. There is communication between patients and PT conducted via text / video messaging. The patient is also able to examine her form during the exercise sessions. The monitoring PT is remotely monitoring his patient real-time from his office. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Patient program adherence in 2015 was nearly 85 percent due the real-time patient monitoring and the at-home use of the platform. Now physical therapy practices have a way to scale profitably using a technology platform that can help them grow beyond the limits of the typical brick and mortar PT clinic. 

&#160; 

Additional Treatment Protocols: The Company&#8217;s initial PHZIO application is a 6-month exercise program for patients with back, knee or hip pain. The next two platforms are anticipated to be released in the second quarter of 2016 include a total knee and hip replacement exercise program. These hip and knee programs have been designed to be integrated into any hospital or medical group's Medicare CMS bundled payment model for post-acute care physical therapy. These two programs are anticipated to be followed by woman's health and geriatric programs by the end of the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Our PHZIO platform enables employees or patients to engage with live or on-demand video based physical therapy telemedicine treatments from their home or office. Following a physicians exam and prescription for physical therapy to treat back, knee or hip pain, a patient can be examined by a physical therapist and if found appropriate inducted in the Company&#8217;s PHZIO program that includes a progressive 6-month telemedicine exercise program (including monthly in-clinic check ups). All PHZIO treatments are monitored by a licensed therapist that sees everything the patient is doing while providing their professional guidance and feedback in real-time. This ensures treatment compliance by the patient, maintains the safety and integrity of the prescribed exercises, tracks patient metrics and captures pre and post treatment evaluation data. PHZIO unlocks a host of potential for revolutionizing patient treatment models and directly links back to the established brick and mortar physical therapy clinic. This unique model enables any physical therapy practice to be able to execute more patient care while utilizing their same resources, and creates more value than was ever before possible. 

&#160; 

During 2015 our PHZIO platform achieved the following metrics: 

&#160; 

&#9679; The total (insurance reimbursed) monitored PHZIO visits in 2015: 699 patient visits (239 paid patient visits total). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The average insurance reimbursement per PHZIO session in 2015: $46.87 (excluding co-payments). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The top line wellness goals of our PHZIO program are to graduate at least 80% of inducted patients through our 6-month program. Patients should expect to experience an average of a 20% reduction in BMI, a 4-inch reduction in waist size, weight loss of at least 20 pounds, significant overall improvement in balance, coordination, flexibility, strength, and lumbopelvic stability. Patients also should scored better on Functional Outcomes Scales (Oswestry and LEFS), which indicates improved functional activity levels due to reduced low back, knee and hip pain. &#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our PHZIO platform, including: design, testing, exercise intervention, follow-up, and exercise demonstration, has been developed by accomplished Los Angeles based physical therapist Darwin Fogt. Mr. Fogt has extensive experience and education working with diverse populations from professional athletes to morbidly obese. He understands the most beneficial exercise prescription to achieve optimal results and has had great success in motivating all patient types to stay consistent in working toward their goals. Additionally, his methods have proven effective and safe as he demonstrates exercises with attention to proper form to avoid injury. Mr. Fogt has established himself as a national leader in his field and has successfully implemented progressive solutions to delivering physical therapy: he has consulted with and been published by numerous national publications including Runner&#8217;s World, Men&#8217;s Health, Men&#8217;s Journal, and various Physical Therapy specific magazines; his 13 plus years of experience include rehabilitating the general population, as well as professional athletes, Olympic gold medalists, and celebrities. He has bridged the gap between physical therapy and fitness by opening Evolution Fitness, which uses licensed physical therapists to teach high intensity circuit training fitness classes. He also founded one of the first exclusive prenatal and postnatal physical therapy clinic in the country. Mr. Fogt is a leader in advancing the profession to incorporate research-based methods and focus on, not only rehabilitation but also wellness, functional fitness, performance, and prevention. He is able to recognize that the national healthcare structure (federal and private insurance) is moving toward a model of prevention and that the physical therapy profession will take a larger role in providing wellness services to patients. 

&#160; 

Innovators in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and business models that deliver products and services on-demand and create new economies by connecting and empowering both consumers and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current access to physical therapy clinics. 

&#160; 

Our underlying technology platform is complex, deeply integrated and purpose-built over the three years for the evolving physical therapy marketplace. Our PHZIO platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth of third party licensees. Our PHZIO platform provides for broad interconnectivity between PT practitioners and their patients and, we believe, uniquely positions us as a focal point in the rapidly evolving PT industry to introduce innovative, technology-based solutions, such as remote patient monitoring, post-discharge treatment plan adherence and in-home care. 

&#160; 

We plan to generate revenue from third-party PT and corporate wellness licensees on a contractually recurring per PHZIO session fee basis. Our PHZIO platform is anticipated to transform the access, cost and quality dynamics of physical therapy delivery for all of the market participants. We further believe any patient, employer, health plan or healthcare professional interested in a better approach to physical therapy is a potential PHZIO platform user. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

We entered into a share exchange agreement (the &#8220;Initial Exchange Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which we agreed to issue, 9,200,000 shares of our unregistered common stock, $.001 par value (the &#8220;common stock&#8221;) to the shareholders of eWellness Corporation, a Nevada corporation (&#8220;eWellness&#8221; or &#8220;Private Co.&#8221;). In addition, our former chief executive officer agreed to tender 5,000,000 shares of common stock back to the Company for cancellation and also to assign from his holdings an additional 2,500,000 shares to the shareholders of eWellness Corporation resulting in a total of 11,700,000 shares owned by those shareholders, as well as a further assignment of an additional 2,100,000 shares to other parties as stated therein. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement. 

&#160; 

The closing of the Initial Exchange Agreement was conditioned upon certain, limited customary representations and warranties, as well as, among other things, our compliance with Rule 419 (&#8220;Rule 419&#8221;) of Regulation C under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the consent of our shareholders as required under Rule 419. However, Rule 419 required that the share exchange transaction (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;) contemplated by the Initial Exchange Agreement occur on or before March 18, 2014. Accordingly, after numerous discussions with management and eWellness, the parties entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;) to reflect a revised business combination structure, pursuant to which we would: (i) file a registration statement on Form 8-A (&#8220;Form 8A&#8221;) to register our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, which we did on May 1, 2014 and (ii) seek to convert the participants of the 419 transaction into participants of a similarly termed private offering (the &#8220;Converted Offering&#8221;). We also agreed to change our name to eWellness Healthcare Corporation to more accurately reflect our new business and operations after the Share Exchange, which occurred and was effective as of April 25, 2014. 

&#160; 

As the parties satisfied all of the closing conditions, on April 30, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we purchased 100% of eWellness&#8217; common stock in exchange for 9,200,000 shares of our then outstanding shares of common stock and the share exchange closed. As a result, eWellness became our wholly owned subsidiary and its shareholders owned approximately 76.97% of our then issued and outstanding common stock, after giving effect to the cancellation of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock held by Andreas A. McRobbie-Johnson, our former chief executive officer and the further assignment of his shares of common stock as described therein. 

&#160; 

On July 22, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, eWellness Corporation, was merged into the Company and, therefore, no longer exists as a separate entity. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

&#9679; On April 1, 2015, we entered into an Operating Agreement with Evolution Physical Therapy , a company owned by our CEO, wherein it is agreed that EPT would be able to operate our PHZIO telemedicine platform and offer it to selected physical therapy patients of EPT. The Company is to receive 75% of the net insurance reimbursements from the patient for use of the platform. The Company will advance capital requested by EPT for costs specifically associated with operating the www.phzio,com platform and associated physical therapy treatments &#8211; computer equipment, office or facilities rental payments, physical therapist or physical therapy assistant, administrative staff, patient induction equipment, office supplies, utilities and other associated operating costs. It is anticipated that the operation of the platform by EPT will generate positive cash flow within 90 days from the start of patient induction. On May 7, 2015, EPT inducted the first patient using our platform. All treatment revenue of approximately $13,500 for 2015 was reimbursed to EPT, but was not sufficient to generate sales for the Company. The total (insurance reimbursed) monitored PHZIO visits in 2015: 699 patient visits (267 paid patient visits total). The average insurance reimbursement per PHZIO session in 2015: $51.26 (excluding co-payments). The top line wellness goals of our PHZIO program are to graduate at least 80% of inducted patients through our 6-month program. Patients should expect to experience an average of a 20% reduction in BMI, a 4-inch reduction in waist size, weight loss of at least 20 pounds, significant overall improvement in balance, coordination, flexibility, strength, and lumbopelvic stability. Patients also should score better on Functional Outcomes Scales (Oswestry and LEFS), which indicates improved functional activity levels due to reduced low back, knee and hip pain. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On April 17, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Akash Bajaj, M.D., M.P.H. The agreement is for Dr. Bajaj to serve as a consultant and as the Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Clinical Advisory Board. The term of the agreement is for one year with annual renewal as desired. The agreement further sets the hourly rate to be paid at $225 per hour with payment to be at the end of each month. Further, the Company granted Dr. Bajaj a five-year non-statutory option to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock at a price of $.35 per share. The options will vest over a 12 month period at 8,333 per month. 

&#160; 

The Physical Therapy Telemedicine Space 

&#160; 

One of the most promising and rapidly developing areas of healthcare and rehabilitation is telemedicine &#8211; the use of telecommunication technologies to provide health information, assessment, monitoring, and treatment to individuals with chronic conditions from a distance. Increasingly, insurers, healthcare providers, and technology vendors are using telemedicine solutions and services to make medical intervention both more convenient and accessible to patients to raise the quality of care while reducing costs. (Herrick 2007). 

&#160; 

Low back pain is second only to upper respiratory problems as a symptom-related reason for visits to a physician. (Andersson 1999 Hart 1995). By 2023, the estimated cost of chronic conditions including low back pain and diabetes including treatment and lost productivity will swell to $4.2 trillion annually. (Deyo 2001). Home-based telemedicine holds promise as an effective method for providing physical therapy exercise programs to these segments of our populations including people with back, hip and knee pain and for those individuals who may be pre-diabetic and/or are obese. 

&#160; 

Physical therapy intervention including core muscle strengthening exercise along with lumbar flexibility and gluteus maximus strengthening is an effective rehabilitation technique for all chronic low back pain patients irrespective of different duration (less than one year and more than one year) of their pain. (Kumar 2014). It has also been widely proven that strengthening and aerobic exercises are effective at reducing symptoms and preventing knee pain among patients with osteoarthritis and other painful knee conditions. (Senanik 2012). 

&#160; 

Physical therapy intervention is becoming an increasingly accepted mode of intervention delivery and policy recommendations have been made to State Boards of Physical Therapy. (Julian 2014). The PHZIO platform complies and exceeds the recommendations for physical therapy intervention delivered via telemedicine. 

&#160; 

The PHZIO platform eliminates the barrier of transportation, offers participants the flexibility of exercising at their preferred time of day, and does not involve as much energy or time necessary to get to an exercise or fitness facility. 

&#160; 

Traditionally, physical therapy exercise programs are based upon exercise and education provisioned by physical therapist to patients at a brick and mortar facility using a face-to-face model of care. Over the past three years, we have conceptualized, designed, engineered, tested and deployed our PHZIO platform. 

&#160; 

Our PHZIO Platform 

&#160; 

Our current PHZIO 6-month 78 session 40-minute on-line distance monitored telemedicine exercise program is a physician prescribed (insurance reimbursable) physical therapy exercise program designed around an exercise kit that includes: an inflatable exercise ball, latex resistance bands, a yoga mat and stretch strap that provides a comprehensive exercise regimen that minimizes stress on the joints while allowing for hundreds of progressive exercises that focus on strength, balance, cardiovascular conditioning, coordination and flexibility. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Our PHZIO platform is an on-line distance monitored telemedicine exercise program with a 6-month duration, wherein seventy-eight (78) individual 40-minute progressive exercise sessions are watched &#38; interacted with by a patient on their laptop computer. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The patients are inducted into the PHZIO program through a physician prescription and physical therapist evaluation. The PHZIO physical therapy program is designed around an exercise kit that includes: an inflatable exercise ball, latex resistance bands, a yoga mat and stretch strap. &#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The patient follows the PHZIO instructions and performs the specific exercises while being remotely monitored by a physical therapist through the camera located on the laptop computer. The PHZIO program provides a comprehensive exercise regimen that minimizes stress on the joints while allowing for hundreds of progressive exercises that focuses on strength, balance, coordination, and flexibility. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The PHZIO program is designed to be operated in a patient&#8217;s home or office in order to increase compliance and eliminate transportation to a fitness center or gym. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our physical therapists monitor up to 30 patients at a time while these patients are on-line and following along with our PHZIO exercise program. Each patient and physical therapist has real-time text and video conferencing capability when interaction is needed between the patient and our physical therapist. &#160; 

When patients are referred to eWellness licensee, a physical therapist and assistant will evaluate patients for the program. The goal is to ensure compliance with the regimen, reduce BMI to a healthy number, help patients lose weight and boost their activity level for the six-month program. 

&#160; 

Patients can access a series of progressively difficult workouts in 40- to 45-minute videos from home. They use a unique log-in from an application, which will securely store all their data over a six-month period. When patients log on, it triggers a camera in the physical therapists&#8217; remote office. 

&#160; 

Physical therapists will monitor patients to ensure compliance. A remote physical therapist watches in real time while the patient is performing the exercises and guides him through his exercise sessions. The therapist provides constant feedback, instruction and motivation and ensures patients are doing the exercises properly and safely. The supervising therapist can speak to the user or communicate through text message. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We have identified multiple privately-held telemedicine and exercise platform companies that utilize Avatar/Kinect-based telerehb platforms incuding: Reflexion Health, RespondWell, Physmodo, Jintronx, MotionCare 360 and Five Plus. Additionally, we have identified other video-based physical therapy solutions such as: Bluejay, PT Pal, VitalRock, Physiotech, SimplyTherapy and YouTube. Yet, none of these companies have real-time PT monitoring, one-to-many platform, treatments reimbursable by payors and strong program compliance and adherence by patients. 

&#160; 

The PZHIO.COM Exercise Program 

&#160; 

A Monitored In-office &#38; Telemedicine Exercise Program : Our 6-month PHZIO exercise program has been designed to provide patients, who are accepted into the program, with traditional one-on-one PT evaluations, re-evaluations (every one to four weeks throughout the PHZIO program depending on type of insurance), and at the conclusion of the program a Physical Performance Test. These PTs are known as Induction &#38; Evaluation Physical Therapists (&#8220;IEPTs&#8221;). All patient medical data, information and records are retained in the files of the IEPT. The IEPT will also evaluate the progress of the patient&#8217;s participation in our PHZIO program. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Physician Diagnosis: Following a physician&#8217;s diagnosis of a patient with non-acute back pain, who is also likely overweight and pre-diabetic, a physician may prescribe the patient to participate in the eWellness PHZIO exercise program. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Enrollment Process : The accepted patients are assessed by a PT, located at a PT Licensee clinic and then enrolled in our PHZIO program by going online to our PHZIO program virtual private network (&#8220;VPN&#8221;) and creating a login name and password. The patient will then populate their calendar with planned times when they anticipate exercising. They will also be provided with a free exercise ball, resistance stretch bands, stretch strap and yoga mat at induction. &#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Exercising Begins : The day after the patient receives the equipment, the patient will log on to our VPN at least 3 times per week, to watch and follow the prescribed 40 minute on-line exercise program. The PHZIO platform also allows two-way communication (videoconferencing) with one of our licensee&#8217;s On-line Physical Therapists (&#8220;OLPT&#8217;s&#8221;), who is responsible for monitoring on-line patients. The OLPT&#8217;s are also available to answer patient&#8217;s questions. When available the patients exercise sessions are recorded and stored in our system as proof that they completed the prescribed exercises. There are 78 various 40-minute exercise videos that are viewed by our patients in successive order. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Open 6am-9:30am 5 days per week : Our PHZIO system has a calendar function so that patients can schedule when they will login to our PHZIO system. This calendar enables a PT Licensee to better spread the load of patients participating in any forty-minute on-line exercise program during our 15 hours of weekly operations, 6am through 9:30am Monday through Friday. Also, if the patient is not on-line at the planned exercise time, our system can send them an automated reminder, via text, voicemail and or e-mail messaging. &#160; 

Trackable Physical Therapy . The exercise PHZIO prescription and instruction will be delivered with a series of on-line videos easily accessed by each patient on the internet. Each video will be 40 minutes in length with exercises, which will specifically address the common impairments associated with diabetes and/or obesity. Exercise programs will be able to be performed within each patient&#8217;s own home or work location without requiring standard gym equipment. Each patient will be required to log in to the system with will monitor performance automatically in order to ensure their compliance. Each patient will be required to follow up with their referring physician and PT at designated intervals and metrics such as blood pressure, blood sugars, BMI, etc. will be recorded to ensure success of the program. 

&#160; 

Patient Program Goals . On average each patient is targeted to lose 2 pounds per week, totaling up to 48 pounds over the duration of the program to progress toward healthier defined BMI, reduction body fat percentage by at least 8%, reduced reliance on medication for blood glucose regulation and dosage or frequency and a goal of at least a 50% adherence to continuing the PHZIO program independently at conclusion of program. 

&#160; 

Trackable Video Exercise Program . The On-Line PHZIO video content includes all aspects of wellness preventative care to ensure the best results: cardiovascular training, resistance training, flexibility, and balance and stabilization; research studies on all such distinct impairments have shown to provide effective treatment results. Each video integrates each of the four components to guarantee a comprehensive approach to the wellness program, but each video will specifically highlight one of the four components. All of our PHZIO video content can be viewed on all desktops, tablets, PC&#8217;s and MAC computers. 

&#160; 

Specific Video Programs . Each patient will receive a prescription for six months (26 week) of physical therapy and exercise that is provided by viewing on-line programs produced by eWellness where the patient can do these exercises and stretching on their own at least 3 days per week for at least 40 minutes. The PHZIO videos can be watched on a laptop or desktop computer. In order to view the videos the patient would log onto the eWellness web-site and would be directed to watch the appropriate video in sequence. As the patient is logged-in, eWellness will be able to monitor how often and if the entire video session was viewed. This data would be captured and sent weekly to the prescribing physician and eWellness PT for review. At all times, a licensed OLPT/PTA will have access to each patient utilizing the videos and will be able to communicate with a patient via video-conferencing and/or instant messaging. This will help improve adherence to the program as well as the success and safety of the patients&#8217; treatments. A patient will also be instructed to walk or ride a bike at least 30 minutes three days per week in addition to participating in our program. 

&#160; 

If the patient is not viewing the videos, then the prescribing physician and/or the eWellness PT would reach out to the patient by telephone and/or e-mail to encourage the patient to keep up their physical fitness regime. After each series the patient returns for an office visit to the prescribing physician for blood tests, blood pressure and a weight management check- up as well as a follow-up visit with the PT for assessment of the patient&#8217;s progress toward established goals. 

&#160; 

Exercise Patient Kits . Each patient will receive a home exercise tool kit, which will include: an inflatable exercise ball, a hand pump, a yoga mat, a yoga strap, and varying levels of resistance bands, free of any additional charges. Each of the PHZIO exercise videos will include exercises that incorporate the items in the tool kit. By using a bare minimum of equipment, patients should be able to participate more easily at home or at their workplace. Our estimated cost of the kit is $49, which we pay and factored in to our revenue stream and internal projections. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Cloud-based PHZIO System Design . Our CTO, Curtis Hollister, is currently a principal shareholder and operator of two video content platform based businesses in Ottawa Canada that have built and own the intellectual property for various global corporate and governmental projects having similar requirements as ours. Not only will Mr. Hollister&#8217;s experience stand to significantly shorten our path to service activation of our own program, but his industry contacts will provide immediate access to valuable resources. Because of this access, initially all system maintenance, updates and upgrades of our PHZIO platform will be made by Mr. Hollister as our Chief Technology Officer and a readily available team of independent freelance consultants in Ottawa. Additionally, through his ownership in these video content platform businesses, the Company was able to enter into an agreement with one of them to secure the rights to intellectual property completing approximately 100% of the Company&#8217;s systems requirements at a total cost of $20,000. Our platform was built based on the Zendesk&#174; highly-scalable customer service application platform. Currently, all system maintenance, updates and upgrades will be made by Mr. Hollister&#8217;s team in Ottawa. 

&#160; 

Insurance/Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Thus far in the state of California our initial licensee has successfully gained reimbursement from Blue Cross, Blue Shield and CIGNA insurance companies. The licensee receiver reimbursements that are equivalent to in-clinic patient reimbursements. For PT licensee patients whose insurance companies provide little or no reimbursement for Physical Therapy Telemedicine Reimbursement, they may have higher co-payments for participating in the PHZIO program or be responsible to pay the full cost of such services. 

&#160; 

Expansion into other markets where telemedicine has high support . On December 20 th 2013, we executed a 25-year licensing agreement with a London, Ontario based telemedicine company Physical Relief Telemedicine Health Care Services (&#8220;PRTHCS&#8221;), pursuant to which we granted PRTHCS a limited, transferable right to use and promote our PHZIO Program within the province of Ontario; additional Canadian territories may be added at the parties mutual discretion. PRTHCS has a known track-record in the telemedicine industry in Canada. To date PRTHCS has been unsuccessful in licensing our PHZIO platform to any Canadian based PT clinics. 

&#160; 

Our Planned Expansion into other States where Telemedicine has high support . The most common path being taken by states is to cover telemedicine services in their Medicaid program. 42 states now provide some form of Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services (mostly physician to physician consultations). More importantly 16 states have now expanded their definition of telemedicine to include physical therapy and have also required that state and private insurance plans cover telemedicine services. Those 16 states with the broadest telemedicine policies include: Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Vermont. 

&#160; 

Company Development Costs As of the date of this Report, we have spent approximately 28 months developing our unique business model and our design for eWellness&#8217;s automated website and systems for our PHZIO program. Over the course of the 28-month development phase we expended approximately $2,057,611 in travel expenses, legal, consulting services and miscellaneous expenses. 

&#160; 

Initial Program Patient Inclusion Criteria 

&#160;

REGULATIONS AND HEALTHCARE REFORM 

&#160; 

Numerous federal, state and local regulations regulate healthcare services and those who provide them. Some states into which we may expand have laws requiring facilities employing health professionals and providing health-related services to be licensed and, in some cases, to obtain a certificate of need (that is, demonstrating to a state regulatory authority the need for, and financial feasibility of, new facilities or the commencement of new healthcare services). Only one of the states in which we intend to roll out our services requires a certificate of need for the operation of our physical therapy business functions. Our therapists however, are required to be licensed, as determined by the state in which they provide services. Failure to obtain or maintain any required certificates, approvals or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

State Legislation 

&#160; 

Insurance reimbursement for our PHZIO services is likely to improve in 2016 and beyond based upon current draft legislation in Congress that seeks to significantly expand Medicare&#8217;s reimbursement for telemedicine services including for physical therapy. If passed, this legislation would drive private healthcare insurers to also reimburse for physical therapy associated with telemedicine. Also, in early November 2014, we were advised by the California State Board of Physical Therapy (&#8220;CSBPT&#8221;) that we could operate our PHZIO platform and bill patients insurance within the Association&#8217;s rules in the state of California. 

&#160; 

Stark Law 

&#160; 

Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395nn) (the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;) prohibit referrals by a physician of &#8220;designated health services&#8221; which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician&#8217;s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the &#8220;designated health services&#8221;. Further, the Stark Law has application to the Company&#8217;s management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, including any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our clinics, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

HIPAA 

&#160; 

In an effort to further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentially, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of health fraud against all public and private insurers. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and electronic security of patient information and standards relating to the privacy of health information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February of 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;) was signed into law. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), provided for substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (&#8220;EHRs&#8221;) and grants for the development of health information exchange (&#8220;HIE&#8221;). Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the new mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA. 

&#160; 

We believe that our current business operations are fully compliant with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Factors 

&#160; 

Political, economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the healthcare industry in the United States. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Based upon newly finalized FDA rules, we believe that our PHZIO platform is exempt from Federal Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulation. Yet, in the unlikely event that these rules change in the future, the FDA could then require us to seek 510K approvals for our on-line services that could create delays in provisioning our PHZIO services. (See FDA ruling noted below) Also, potential alternative approaches could include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and price controls. Legislative debate is expected to continue in the future and market forces are expected to demand only modest increases or reduced costs. For instance, managed care entities are demanding lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and, in some cases, are requiring or encouraging providers to accept capitated payments that may not allow providers to cover their full costs or realize traditional levels of profitability. We cannot reasonably predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform measures or future private sector reform may have on our business.

FDA Ruling: Examples of Mobile App&#8217;s which it Intends to Exclude from Regulation 

&#160; 

On September 25, 2013, the FDA issued Finalized Guidance of medical mobile applications (&#8220;Apps&#8221;). The FDA has issued a ruling on Apps that may meet the definition of a medical device, but they have determined that they will not exercise enforcement on these Apps. The Guidance contains an appendix that provides examples of mobile apps that MAY meet the definition of medical device but for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion. These mobile apps may be intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Even though these mobile apps may meet the definition of medical device, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for these mobile apps because they pose lower risk to the public. The FDA understands that there may be other unique and innovative mobile apps that may not be covered in this list that may also constitute healthcare related mobile apps. This list is not exhaustive; it is only intended to provide clarity and assistance in identifying the mobile apps that will not be subject to regulatory requirements at this time. Based on our understanding of the Guidance, although there can be no guarantee, we believe our PHZIO platform will not be subject to regulatory requirements at this time because such services seem to fall within the statutory examples.
