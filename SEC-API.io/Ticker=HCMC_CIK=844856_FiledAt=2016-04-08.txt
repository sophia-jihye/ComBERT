 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Vapor Corp. (&#8220;Vapor&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) operates 20 vape stores in the Southeastern United States and online where it sells vaporizers, liquids for vaporizers and e-cigarettes. The Company also designs, markets and distributes electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, e-liquids and accessories under the Vapor X&#174;, Hookah Stix&#174;, Vaporin&#8482;, Krave&#174;, and Honey Stick&#174; brands. &#8220;Electronic cigarettes&#8221; or &#8220;e-cigarettes,&#8221; and &#8220;vaporizers&#8221; are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without fire, smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. We also design and develop private label brands for our distribution customers. Third party manufacturers manufacture our products to meet our design specifications. We market our products as alternatives to traditional tobacco cigarettes and cigars. In 2014, as a response to market product demand changes, Vapor began to shift its primary focus from electronic cigarettes to vaporizers.

&#160;

We offer our vaporizers and e-cigarettes and related products through our vape stores, online, customer direct phone center, online stores, to retail channels through our direct sales force, and through third party wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. Retailers of our products include small-box discount retailers, gas stations, drug stores, convenience stores, tobacco shops and kiosk locations in shopping malls throughout the United States.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business strategy is currently focused on a multi-pronged approach to diversify our revenue streams to include the brick-and-mortar retail locations. We are seeing that there is a large consumer demand centered on the vaporizer products and the retention &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; created by the stores. Our distribution sales continue to be a significant part of our operations and we anticipate an improvement in their growth as we have adjusted towards vaporizers in addition to our e-cigarette brands.

&#160;

Merger with Vaporin, Inc. 

&#160;

On March 4, 2015, the Company completed pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Vaporin, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Vaporin&#8221;) by which Vaporin and its wholly owned subsidiaries including, The Vape Store, Inc. merged with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). The Company had also entered into a joint venture with Vaporin (the &#8220;Joint Venture&#8221;) through the execution of an operating agreement (the &#8220;Operating Agreement&#8221;) of Emagine, pursuant to which the Company and Vaporin were 50% members of Emagine. In connection with the Merger, Emagine became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.

&#160;

Retail Stores 

&#160;

The Company acquired eight Florida retail stores in the aforementioned Merger in March 2015, and opened three additional Florida retail stores between April and August 2015. On August 31, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of two established retail stores in Gainesville, Florida. On September 3, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of one established retail store in Fort Myers, Florida. On October 10, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of three established retail stores in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 6, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of two retail stores located in Atlanta, Georgia, and Nashville, Tennessee, and a retail store with an adjoining warehouse located in Birmingham, Alabama. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company ceased its plans to increase the number of retail stores due to adverse industry trends and increasing federal and state regulations that, if implemented, may negatively impact future retail revenues.

&#160; 

Series A Units Offering 

&#160;

On July 29, 2015, the Company closed a registered public offering of 3,761,657 Series A Units (&#8220;Units&#8221;) at $11.00 per Unit for gross proceeds of approximately $41.4 million and net proceeds of approximately $38.7 million . Each Unit is comprised of one-fourth of share of Series A convertible preferred stock and 0.1429 shares of Series A warrants. 

&#160;

Change from NASDAQ to OTCQB Stock Listing 

&#160;

On January 22, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the &#8220;Staff&#8221;) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist the Company&#8217;s securities based upon its concerns that the Company&#8217;s continued listing on Nasdaq, particularly pursuant to a grace period within which to regain compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450, is no longer in the public interest as that concept is described in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5110. Specifically, the Staff indicated that, given the potential for dilution of the Company&#8217;s stockholders that may be caused by the cashless exercise provision of the Company&#8217;s Series A warrants, the Staff believes that the grace period provided to the Company to regain compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement is no longer warranted. Previously on September 14, 2015, the Staff had notified the Company that, based upon its non-compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price requirement for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the Company &#8211; in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules &#8211; had been provided a grace period, through March 14, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On the afternoon of February 11, 2016, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that trading of the Company&#8217;s common stock would be halted.

&#160;

On February 16, 2016, the Company notified the Staff of Nasdaq that it was withdrawing its request to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the &#8220;Panel&#8221;) for an appeal of the delisting determination made by the Staff on January 22, 2016. As a result, the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock were suspended from The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on Wednesday, February 17, 2016. Nasdaq filed a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the delisting of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The official delisting of the Company&#8217;s common stock became effective ten days thereafter. Upon the delisting from Nasdaq, the Company no longer met the &#8220;Equity Conditions&#8221; required to issue the Company&#8217;s common stock to fulfill a cashless exercise pursuant to Section 1(d) of its Series A Warrants. The Company began trading on the OTCQB Market at the opening of the markets on March 16, 2016 under its temporary symbol, VPCOD and thereby met the &#8220;Equity Conditions&#8221; required to issue the Company&#8217;s common stock to fulfill a cashless exercise pursuant to Section 1(d) of its Series A Warrants.

&#160;

Vaporizers and Electronic Cigarettes 

&#160;

&#8220;Vaporizers&#8221; and &#8220;electronic cigarettes,&#8221; or &#8220;e-cigarettes,&#8221; are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction are comprised of three functional components:

&#160;

&#8226; a mouthpiece, which is a small plastic cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution; &#160;

&#8226; the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and &#160;

&#8226; the electronic devices which include: a lithium-ion battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED, which illuminates to indicate use. &#160;

When a user draws air through the electronic cigarette and/or vaporizer, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution stored in the mouthpiece/cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either of which may be flavored.

&#160;

Our Vaporizers and Electronic Cigarettes 

&#160;

Vaporizers feature a tank or chamber, a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with e-liquid or the chamber with dry herb or leaf. The vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled.

&#160;

We also offer disposable electronic cigarettes in multiple sizes, puff counts, styles, flavors and nicotine strengths; rechargeable electronic cigarettes that use replaceable cartridges (also known as &#8220;cartomizers&#8221;), and rechargeable vaporizers for use with either electronic cigarette solution (&#8220;e-liquid&#8221;) or dry herbs or leaf. Disposable electronic cigarettes feature a one-piece construction that houses all the components and is utilized until the nicotine or nicotine free solution is depleted. Rechargeable electronic cigarettes feature a rechargeable battery and replaceable cartridge (also known as a &#8220;cartomizer&#8221;). The cartomizers are changed when the solution is depleted from use.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Brands 

&#160;

We sell our vaporizers, electronic cigarettes and e-liquids under several different brands, including, Krave&#174;, VaporX&#174;, HookahStix&#174; and Vaporin&#8482;, Honey Stick&#174; brands. We also design and develop private label brands for our distribution customers. Our in-house engineering and graphic design team&#8217;s work to provide aesthetically pleasing, technologically advanced affordable vaporizers and e-cigarette options. We are in the process of preparing to commercialize additional brands which we intend to market to new customers and demographics.

&#160;

Our Improvements and Product Development 

&#160;

We have developed and trademarked or are preparing to commercialize additional products. We include product development expenses as part of our operating expenses. We currently own no patents which are material to our business. We have a patent application pending in the United States. There is no assurance that we will be awarded patents for of any of these pending patent applications.

&#160;

Flavor Profiles 

&#160;

We are developing new flavor profiles that are distinct to our brands. We believe that as the vaporizer and electronic cigarette industry matures, users of vaporizers and electronic cigarettes will develop, if they have not already, preferences for the product based not only on their quality, ability to successfully deliver nicotine, battery capacity, and vapor volume they generate, but on taste and flavor, like smokers do with their preferred brand of conventional tobacco cigarettes.

&#160;

Vaporizer Biometric Fingerprint Lock Sensor Patent 

&#160;

We have a patent pending for a biometric fingerprint lock sensor that can be used in vaporizers. The biometric fingerprint lock sensor will allow the owner of the vaporizer to keep the device locked and turned off unless the authorized user unlocks the device via fingerprint scan, protecting the device from use by another individual. This technology may be used to protect against minors being able to turn on the device and will also deem the devices unusable in the event the device is lost or stolen. There is no assurance that we will be awarded a patent for this technology.

&#160;

Our Kits and Accessories 

&#160;

Our vaporizer and electronic cigarettes are available in kits that contain everything a user needs to begin enjoying their &#8220;vaping&#8221; experience. In addition to kits we sell replacement parts including batteries, coils, refill cartridges or cartomizers that contain the liquid solution, atomizers, tanks and e-liquids. Our refill cartridges and e-liquids are available in various assorted flavors and nicotine levels (including 0.0% nicotine). In addition to our electronic cigarette and vaporizer products we sell an assortment of accessories, including various types of chargers (including USB chargers), carrying cases and lanyards.

&#160;

The Market for Vaporizers and Electronic Cigarettes 

&#160;

We market our vaporizers and electronic cigarettes as an alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes and cigars. We offer our products in multiple nicotine strengths, flavors and puff counts. Because vaporizers and electronic cigarettes offer a &#8220;smoking&#8221; experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their nicotine cravings without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases vaporizers and electronic cigarettes may be used where tobacco-burning cigarettes may not. Vaporizers and electronic cigarettes may be used in some instances where for regulatory or safety reasons tobacco burning cigarettes may not be used. However, certain states, cities, businesses, providers of transportation and public venues in the U.S. have already banned the use of vaporizers and electronic cigarettes, where traditional cigarettes may not be smoked, while others are considering banning the use of vaporizers and electronic cigarettes. We cannot provide any assurances that the use of vaporizers and electronic cigarettes will be permitted in places where traditional tobacco burning cigarette use is banned. See the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on page 27.

Advertising 

&#160;

Currently, we advertise our products primarily on the Internet, through trade magazine ads, and through point of sale materials and displays at retail locations. We also attempt to build brand awareness through social media marketing activities, price promotions, and in-store and on premise promotions, public relations and trade show participation. We intend to continue to strategically manage our advertising activities in 2016 to gain editorial coverage for our brands. Some of our competitors promote their brands through print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. We believe that our and our competitors&#8217; efforts have helped increase our sales, our product acceptance and general industry awareness.

&#160;

Distribution and Sales 

&#160;

We offer our vaporizers and electronic cigarettes and related products through our retail vape stores, our websites, and retail channels through our direct sales force, and through third party wholesalers and distributors, retailers and value-added resellers. Retailers of our products include small-box discount retailers, gas stations, drug stores, convenience stores, tobacco shops throughout the United States. Vapor sells directly to consumers through twenty company owned retail vape stores. Our management believes that consumers are shifting towards vape stores for an enhanced experience. This enhanced experienced is derived from the greater variety of products at the stores, the knowledgeable staff and the social atmosphere. Vapor anticipates a significant portion of future revenue will come from its retail stores.

&#160;

We believe that future growth of vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, and e-liquids is dependent on either higher volume, lower margin sales channels, like the broad based distribution network through which cigarettes are sold, or through Company-owned stores. Thus, we focused on growing our retail distribution reach by opening retail stores and entering into distribution agreements with large and established value added resellers. We currently have established relationships with several large retailers and national chains and in connection therewith we have paid slotting fees based on the number of stores our products are carried. These existing relationships are &#8220;at-will&#8221; meaning that either party may terminate the relationship for any reason or no reason at all. In 2015, we closed all of our retail kiosks, due to growing mall restrictions on public vaping, and focused on acquiring and developing the vape stores in Florida and the Southeast USA.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

We believe and are seeing in our current stores that there is a large consumer demand centered on the vaporizer products and the &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; created by the vape stores. Additionally, our business strategy leverages our ability to design market and develop multiple vaporizer and e-cigarette brands and to bring those brands to market through our multiple distribution channels.

&#160;

We believe that our reputation and our experience in the electronic cigarette industry, both from a development, customer service and production perspective give us an advantage in attracting customers, specifically re-sellers who require ongoing support, reliable and consistent supply chains and mechanisms in place for supporting broad based distributors and big box retailers.

&#160;

Moreover, we believe that our history with our suppliers, including the volume of products we source, gives us an advantage over other market participants as it relates to favorable pricing, priority as to inventory supply and delivery and first access to new products, including first access to next generation electronic cigarette products and technology.

&#160;

Our goal is to achieve a position of sustainable leadership in the vaporizer industry. Our strategy consists of the following key elements:

&#160;

&#8226; develop new brands and engineer product offerings with new technology and performance advancements; &#160;

&#8226; continue our product focus on vaporizers and e-liquids; &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; invest in and leverage our new and existing brands through marketing and advertising; &#160;

&#8226; increase our presence in national and regional retailers; &#160;

&#8226; expand our brand awareness and online web presence; &#160;

&#8226; expanding into new potential markets; &#160;

&#8226; scale our distribution through strategic resale partnerships; &#160;

&#8226; align our product offerings and cost with market demand; and &#160;

&#8226; consider diversifying our line of business &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Competition in the electronic cigarette industry, including the vaporizer and e-liquid segments, is intense. We compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, most notably Altria Group, Inc., JT International, Imperial Tobacco, and Reynolds American, Inc., which are big tobacco companies that have electronic cigarette business segments. The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national chain stores, tobacco shops, gas stations, travel stores, shopping mall kiosks, in addition to direct to public sales through the Internet, mail order and telesales.

&#160;

As a general matter, we have access to market and sell the similar vaporizers and electronic cigarettes as our competitors and we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors; accordingly, the key competitive factors for our success is the quality of service we offer our customers, the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including media advertising campaigns and, increasingly, the ability to identify and develop new sources of customers.

&#160;

As discussed above, we compete against &#8220;big tobacco&#8221;, U.S. cigarette manufacturers of both conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes like Altria Group, Inc., JT International, Imperial Tobacco, and Reynolds American, Inc. We compete against &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; who offers not only conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes and vaporizers, but also smokeless tobacco products such as &#8220;snus&#8221; (a form of moist ground smokeless tobacco that is usually sold in sachet form that resembles small tea bags), chewing tobacco and snuff. &#8220;Big tobacco&#8221; has nearly limitless resources, global distribution networks in place and a customer base that is fiercely loyal to their brands. Furthermore, we believe that &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; is devoting more attention and resources to developing, acquiring technology patents, and offering electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and e-liquids as these markets grow. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; is better positioned than small competitors like us to capture a larger share of the electronic cigarette market.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We have no manufacturing capabilities and do not intend to develop any manufacturing capabilities. Third party manufacturers make our products to meet our design specifications. We depend on third party manufacturers for our vaporizers, e-liquid, electronic cigarettes and accessories. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and or consistency of our products may harm our relationships and reputation with customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In order to minimize the risk of supply interruption, we currently utilize several third party manufacturers to manufacture our products to our specifications.

&#160;

We currently utilize several manufacturers, all of which are based in China. We contract with our manufacturers on a purchase order basis. We do not have any output or requirements contracts with any of our manufacturers. Our manufacturers provide us with finished products, which we hold in inventory for distribution, sale and use. Certain Chinese factories and the products they export have recently been the source of safety concerns and recalls, which is generally attributed to lax regulatory, quality control and safety standards. Should Chinese factories continue to draw public criticism for exporting unsafe products, whether those products relate to our products or not, we may be adversely affected by the stigma associated with Chinese production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Although we believe that several alternative sources for our products are available, any failure to obtain the components, chemical constituents and manufacturing services necessary for the production of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160;

We believe that an adequate supply of product and raw materials will be available to us as needed and from multiple sources and suppliers. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have developed and trademarked or are preparing to commercialize additional products. We include product development expenses as part of our operating expenses. We currently own no patents which are material to our business. We have one patent application pending in the United States. There is no assurance that we will be awarded patents for of any of these pending patent applications.

&#160;

Vaporizer Biometric Fingerprint Lock Sensor Patent 

&#160;

We have a patent pending for a biometric fingerprint lock sensor that can be used in vaporizers. The biometric fingerprint lock sensor will allow the owner of the vaporizer to keep the device locked and turned off unless the authorized user unlocks the device via fingerprint scan, protecting the device from use by another individual. This technology may be used to protect against minors being able to turn on the device and will also deem the devices unusable in the event the device is lost or stolen.

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

We own federal trademarks registrations for our brands, including: Fifty-One&#174;, Krave&#174;, Vapor X&#174;, Alternacig&#174;, EZSMOKER&#174;, Green Puffer&#174;, Americig&#174;, Hookah Stix&#174;, Honey Stick&#174;, Vaporin&#8482; and Smoke Star&#174; brands. We have also own additional pending federal trademarks applications for other brands and product lines.

&#160;

Patent Litigation 

&#160;

Third party patent lawsuits alleging our infringement of patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights have and could force us to do one or more of the following:

&#160;

&#8226; stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property; &#160;

&#8226; incur significant legal expenses; &#160;

&#8226; pay substantial damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; &#160;

&#8226; redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; or &#160;

&#8226; attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. &#160;

Future third party lawsuits alleging our infringement of patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others and may be required to obtain more in the future and as the product continues to evolve. We cannot assure you that any future licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while we attempt to design around such patents, or could find that the development, manufacture, or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed. Litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement asserted against us by others, or assert claims of infringement to enforce patents issued to us or exclusively licensed to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how possessed by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, we may become involved in oppositions in foreign jurisdictions, reexaminations declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors. Litigation, opposition, reexamination or interference proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and may have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, we cannot assure you that our efforts to maintain or defend our patents will be successful.

&#160;

Since a 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals decision, the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Family Smoking Prevention and the Tobacco Control Act. Under this decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;drugs&#8221; or &#8220;devices&#8221; or a &#8220;combination product&#8221; under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. This is contrary to anti-smoking devices like nicotine patches, which undergo more extensive FDA regulation. Because Vapor does not market Vapor&#8217;s electronic cigarettes for therapeutic purposes, Vapor&#8217;s electronic cigarettes are subject to being classified as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.

&#160;

On April 24, 2014, the FDA released proposed rules that would extend its regulatory authority to electronic cigarettes and certain other tobacco products under the Tobacco Control Act. The proposed rules would require that electronic cigarette manufacturers (i) register with the FDA and report electronic cigarette product and ingredient listings; (ii) market new electronic cigarette products only after FDA review; (iii) only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the electronic cigarette product will benefit public health as a whole; (iv) not distribute free samples; (v) implement minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18; (vi) include a health warning; and (vii) not sell electronic cigarettes in vending machines, unless in a facility that never admits youth. It is not known how long this regulatory process to finalize and implement the rules may take. Accordingly, Vapor cannot predict the content of any final rules from the proposed rules or the impact they may have. See the &#8220;Risk Factor&#8221; on page 31 which also discusses possible additional FDA rulemaking.

&#160;

In this regard, total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on Vapor&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on Vapor&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell Vapor&#8217;s products. At present, it is difficult to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact Vapor to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting Vapor&#8217;s competitive position.

&#160;

State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. State and local regulation of the e-cigarette market and the usage of e-cigarettes is beginning to accelerate.

&#160;

As local regulations expand, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes, which may have the effect of reducing the demand for Vapor&#8217;s products and as a result have a material adverse effect on Vapor&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to electronic cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to vaporizers and electronic cigarettes would have a material adverse effect on Vapor&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160;

On July 1, 2015, the FDA published a document entitled &#8220;Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking&#8221; or the Advance. Through the Advance, the FDA solicited public comments on whether it should issue rules with respect to nicotine exposure warning and child-resistant packaging for e-liquids containing nicotine. Following public comment, the FDA may issue proposed rules in furtherance of the purposes outlined in the Advance and ultimately pass the rules as proposed or in modified form. We cannot predict whether if rules are passed it will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial conditions.

&#160;

Vapor expects that the tobacco industry will experience significant regulatory developments over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization&#8217;s FCTC. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

&#160;

&#8226;the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

&#160;

&#8226;restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

&#160;

&#8226;the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labelling requirements;

&#160;

&#8226;restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;

&#160;

&#8226;restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

&#160;

&#8226;requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;

&#160;

&#8226;requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;

&#160;

&#8226;increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

&#160;

&#8226;elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and

&#160;

&#8226; encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

&#160;

If Vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, or e-liquids, are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, Vapor&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of April 6, 2016, we had 122 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees, none of which are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good.

&#160;
