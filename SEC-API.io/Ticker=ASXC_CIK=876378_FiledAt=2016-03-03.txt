 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

TransEnterix, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a medical device company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options. The Company is focused on the commercialization and further development of the ALF-X &#174; Surgical Robotic System (the &#147;ALF-X System&#148;), a multi-port robotic system that brings the advantages of robotic surgery to patients while enabling surgeons with innovative technology, and on the development and commercialization of the SurgiBot&#153; System (the &#147;SurgiBot System&#148;), a single-port, robotically enhanced laparoscopic surgical platform. The ALF-X System has been granted a CE Mark in Europe for laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery, as well as limited thoracic operations excluding cardiac and vascular surgery, but is not available for sale in the U.S. The SurgiBot System has been submitted for clearance to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;), and is not yet available for sale in any market. 

The ALF-X System is a multi-port robotic surgery system which allows multiple robotic arms to control instruments and a camera. The system features advanced technology to enable surgeons with haptic feedback and the ability to move the camera via eye movement. The system replicates laparoscopic motion that is familiar to experienced surgeons, and integrates three-dimensional high definition (&#147;3DHD&#148;) vision technology. The ALF-X System also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments thereby reducing additional costs per surgery when compared to laparoscopy. 

The SurgiBot System is designed to utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly by the surgeon, with robotic assistance, while the surgeon remains patient-side within the sterile field. The flexible nature of the SurgiBot System allows for multiple instruments to be introduced and deployed through a single site, thereby offering room for visualization and manipulation once inside the body. The SurgiBot System also allows for 3DHD vision technology. 

Corporate Transactions 

On September 18, 2015, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with SOFAR S.p.A., (&#147;SOFAR&#148;) as seller, Vulcanos S.r.l. (&#147;Vulcanos&#148;), as the acquired company, and TransEnterix International, Inc. (&#147;TransEnterix International&#148;), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company which was incorporated in September 2015, as buyer. The closing of the transactions occurred on September 21, 2015 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the membership interests of Vulcanos from SOFAR (the &#147;ALF-X Acquisition&#148;), and changed the name of Vulcanos to TransEnterix Italia S.r.l (&#147;TransEnterix Italia&#148;). The acquisition included all of the assets, employees and contracts related to the ALF-X System. For a description of the ALF-X Acquisition and related transactions, see the disclosure on page 42 of this Annual Report. 

On September 3, 2013, TransEnterix Surgical, Inc. a Delaware corporation (&#147;TransEnterix Surgical&#148;), and SafeStitch Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;SafeStitch&#148;) consummated a merger transaction whereby TransEnterix Surgical merged with a merger subsidiary of SafeStitch, with TransEnterix Surgical as the surviving entity in the merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;). As a result of the Merger, TransEnterix Surgical became a wholly owned subsidiary of SafeStitch. On December 6, 2013, SafeStitch changed its name to TransEnterix, Inc. 

&#160;

As used herein, the terms &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we&#148; or &#147;us&#148; each refers to both the combination of SafeStitch and TransEnterix Surgical after giving effect to the Merger, and the addition of TransEnterix International and TransEnterix Italia after giving effect to the ALF-X Acquisition, unless the context otherwise provides. The term &#147;SafeStitch&#148; refers to the historic business of SafeStitch Medical, Inc. prior to the Merger, and the term &#147;TransEnterix Surgical&#148; refers to the historic business of TransEnterix Surgical, Inc. prior to the Merger. For a description of the Merger and related transactions, see the disclosure on page 44 of this Annual Report. 

The Company operates in one business segment. Please see the disclosure in Note 2 &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Segments&#148; in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report regarding our business operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. 

We believe that future outcomes of minimally invasive surgery will be enhanced through our combination of more advanced tools and robotic functionality which are designed to: (i) empower surgeons with improved precision, dexterity and visualization; (ii) improve patient satisfaction and enable a desirable post-operative recovery; and (iii) provide a cost-effective robotic system, compared to existing alternatives today, for a potentially wide range of clinical applications. Our strategy is to focus on the development and commercialization of the ALF-X and SurgiBot Systems. 

Market Overview 

Over the past two decades, laparoscopic surgery has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, multiple incisions are necessary to provide surgical access ports. Carbon dioxide gas insufflation is then used to create room in the body cavity, and long rigid instruments are introduced through ports placed in the incisions to perform surgical tasks. Millions of laparoscopic surgical procedures across a broad range of clinical applications are now performed each year worldwide, though many surgeries are still performed in an open fashion. 

While laparoscopy has improved the invasive nature of many previously open procedures, it still has many limitations. Traditional, or rigid, laparoscopy still requires multiple incisions to achieve the visualization and instrument triangulation required to perform successful surgery. Rigid laparoscopy also creates physical challenges by forcing the surgeon&#146;s hands and arms into awkward angles, requiring the surgeon to hold instruments in fixed positions for long periods of time, and requiring an assistant to stabilize and move a laparoscopic camera. Another challenge associated with rigid laparoscopic surgery is the creation of a cumbersome and potentially tissue-damaging fulcrum at the patient&#146;s abdominal wall where instruments are manipulated. Nearly all laparoscopic instruments are rigid instruments that lack the internal articulation required to enhance dexterity in complex tasks. Most laparoscopic surgeries are performed with two-dimensional (&#147;2-D&#148;) visualization of the operative field, making depth perception difficult. 

Despite such limitations, traditional laparoscopy remains the prevalent technique in minimally invasive surgery. We believe that robotic devices that replicate laparoscopic motion are more comfortable for surgeons to adopt, thereby increasing the opportunity to enhance traditional surgical methods with robotics. Our ALF-X System and SurgiBot System each mimic laparoscopic surgery.

Robotic and computer controlled assistance have developed as technologies that offer the potential to improve upon many aspects of the laparoscopic surgical experience. Hundreds of thousands of robotic-assisted surgical procedures are now performed each year worldwide, but they still represent a small fraction of the total laparoscopic procedures performed. While initial widespread adoption of robotic-assisted surgery was focused on urologic and gynecologic procedures that were primarily performed in an open fashion prior to robotics, recently developed robotic approaches have been applied to many other clinical applications, particularly in general surgery. Despite recent advances, we believe there remain many limitations associated with current robotic-assisted surgery systems used in connection with laparoscopic surgeries. 

&#160;

Product Overview 

We are addressing the challenges in laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery with innovative products and product candidates that leverage the best features of both approaches to minimally invasive surgery. 

Current Product Offerings 

ALF-X System 

The ALF-X System is a multi-port robotic surgery system which allows up to four arms to control robotic instruments and a camera. The system builds on the success of laparoscopy by enhancing the traditional features that surgeons have come to expect from existing products and by addressing some of the limitations associated with robotic surgery systems for laparoscopic procedures. The ALF-X System also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery when compared to laparoscopy. The ALF-X System has been granted a CE Mark in Europe for use in abdominal and pelvic surgery, but is not available for sale in the U.S. 

Key features of the ALF-X System are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Haptic Feedback: The ALF-X System&#146;s haptic feedback feature provides the surgeon with the ability to feel the tactile response of the body during a procedure. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhanced Vision: The ALF-X System features 3DHD vision technology and gives the surgeon the ability to move the camera via eye movement so that the camera is centered in the surgeon&#146;s field of vision. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Laparoscopic Motion: The ALF-X System utilizes laparoscopic motion that is similar to the motion used during traditional laparoscopic surgeries. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; View of the Sterile Field: The ALF-X System offers the user an open view of the operating room and sterile field from the console. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enables Use of Standard Trocars: The ALF-X System allows for standard laparoscopic trocars to be used and does not require that robotic arms be docked directly to the patient. Current Products in Development 

SurgiBot System Robotic Platform 

The SurgiBot System is currently in development and is designed as a single-incision, patient-side robotic-assisted surgery system. The system is intended to bring many of the advantages of robotic assistance to single incision laparoscopic surgery while mitigating many of the drawbacks of existing robotic-assisted surgery systems. On June 1, 2015, the Company submitted its 510(k) application to the FDA for clearance of the SurgiBot System which was accepted for review. In August 2015, the FDA requested additional information related to the SurgiBot System 501(k) submission. The Company responded to the additional information request in February 2016. The Company anticipates that it will receive FDA clearance for the SurgiBot System by the end of the first quarter of 2016, and thereafter intends to launch sales of the SurgiBot System during the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

Key features of the SurgiBot System are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patient Side: The SurgiBot System is positioned next to the operating table, thereby allowing the surgeon, as operator, to control the system from within the sterile field next to the patient. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Precision with Scaling : The SurgiBot System allows the user to adjust the level of mechanized movement using scaled ratios. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strength : The SurgiBot System features powered motion driven by motors controlled by the surgeon. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ergonomics : The SurgiBot System stabilizes multiple instruments and a laparoscope and allows the surgeon to reposition his or her hands in an ergonomic fashion. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Internal Triangulation : The SurgiBot System utilizes a deployment mechanism to achieve triangulation of multiple instruments inside the body as contrasted with other single-port robotic systems that rely on crossing instruments at the patient&#146;s abdominal wall. The SurgiBot System allows for triangulation that can be adjusted in the surgical field during a procedure and be maintained at positions throughout a body cavity. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Direct Surgeon Connection to the Instruments : The SurgiBot System allows the surgeon-operator to maintain human tactile feedback along several degrees of motion. Existing robotic systems lack any such tactile feedback. We believe that future advancements in robotic surgery will leverage three growth drivers: (1) build on the success of laparoscopy while addressing limitations; (2) develop innovative technology that addresses trade-offs; and (3) provide a compelling economic value to hospitals. The ALF-X System and the SurgiBot System are designed to meet those needs, and help expand robotic surgery to more diverse markets and a wide range of patients. 

Other Products 

SPIDER Surgical System 

Prior to 2015, TransEnterix Surgical developed and commercialized the SPIDER &#174; Surgical System (the &#147;SPIDER System&#148;), a manual laparoscopic system, in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. The SPIDER System utilized flexible instruments and articulating channels that were controlled directly by the surgeon, allowing for multiple instruments to be introduced via a single site. The SPIDER System was cleared by the FDA in 2009 and CE Marked in August 2011. The Company also manufactured multiple instruments that could be deployed using the disposable SPIDER System. As of December 31, 2014, we ceased all commercialization efforts with respect to the SPIDER System in order to fully focus our efforts on our other products, including the SurgiBot System. 

Surgical Instruments 

The Company has developed and manufactures flexible and rigid laparoscopic surgical instruments that are used in abdominal surgery, such as scissors, graspers, clip appliers, and suction and irrigation instruments. Such instruments were sold in limited volumes in connection with the SPIDER System, and have been adapted for use with the SurgiBot System. 

&#160;

In April 2014, we launched a flexible energy device. This product received 510(k) clearance in March 2013 from the FDA, and it provides surgeons with a flexible instrument that can be used to perform tissue ligation. We believe the flexibility of our instrument provides the surgeon with the ability to create proper angles for tissue ligation that cannot be achieved with the more rigid product alternatives. 

In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had no revenue and no U.S. customers, as we focused our efforts on the SurgiBot System development. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had one U.S. customer who accounted for 37% of our revenue of TransEnterix Surgical&#146;s products, including the SPIDER System. As noted above, the Company ceased marketing and selling the SPIDER System on December 31, 2014 to focus on its development activities, therefore the Company was not dependent on these customers. 

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to focus our resources on the commercialization and further development of the ALF-X System and the development and commercialization of the SurgiBot System. We expect to launch sales of the SurgiBot System, subject to our obtaining the requisite regulatory clearances and approvals. 

We believe that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; there are a number of hospitals and an increasing number of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. and internationally that could benefit from the addition of robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery either through a lower cost of capital expenditure or lower operational costs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; with the ALF-X System, surgeons can benefit from the haptic feedback, enhanced 3DHD vision and open architecture consistent with current laparoscopic surgery procedures; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; with the SurgiBot System, surgeons can benefit from the ease of use, 3-D visualization and precision of robotic-assisted surgery while remaining patient-side within the sterile field, consistent with current laparoscopic surgery procedures; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; patients will continue to seek a minimally invasive option, offering minimal scarring and fewer incisions, for many common general abdominal and gynecologic surgeries, which desires are addressed by both systems. Research and Development 

We are focusing our research and development efforts on the SurgiBot System. Our experience with the SPIDER Surgical System, which the Company discontinued selling as of December 31, 2014, has significantly advanced the development of certain components of the SurgiBot System. For example, the EndoDrive device portion of the SurgiBot System is very similar to the function and form of the SPIDER System that is inserted into the patient and features flexible articulating channels. The instruments used with both the SurgiBot System and the SPIDER System are long and flexible with many similar instrument tips and performance requirements. In addition to growing our internal expertise, we continue to collaborate extensively with outside experts in robotic systems and visualization technologies. 

&#160;

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $29.7 million, $27.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In 2015 and 2014 such expenses primarily related to the SurgiBot System development. For 2013, such expenses related to the TransEnterix Surgical and SafeStitch products in development. We fund our research and development expenses primarily from proceeds raised from equity and debt financing transactions. We expect to continue to use equity and debt financing transactions to fund our research and development activities. No customers are obligated to pay any material portion of such research and development expenses. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that our intellectual property and expertise is an important competitive resource. Our experienced research and development team has created a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We maintain an active program of intellectual property protection, both to assure that the proprietary technology developed by us is appropriately protected and, where necessary, to assure that there is no infringement of our proprietary technology by competitive technologies. 

The following summarizes our current patent and patent application portfolio. 

Patents and Patent Applications Owned by the Company : The Company holds six United States patents, one Italian patent, one Russian patent, a European patent, two Japanese patents, and two Australian patents, and it has more than thirty patent applications filed in the United States and abroad. In each instance, we own all right, title and interest, and no licenses, security interests or other encumbrances have been granted on such patents and patent applications. The Italian and Russian patents resulted from filings related to the ALF-X System and will remain in force until 2030 and 2031, respectively. Three of our United States patents resulted from filings relating to the SPIDER System, which the Company stopped selling as of December 31, 2014, and will remain in force until 2028, 2028 and 2032, respectively. The European, Japanese and Australian patents, which also resulted from filings relating to the SPIDER System, will expire in 2027. The patent applications relate to the SPIDER System, the SurgiBot System, the ALF-X System and other instruments and systems for minimally invasive surgical procedures. We intend to seek further patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and internationally, where available and when appropriate, as we continue our SurgiBot System and ALF-X System product development efforts. 

Patents and Patent Applications Licensed to the Company : TransEnterix Italia has exclusively licensed technology, know-how, patents and patent applications relating to the ALF-X System from the European Union. This licensed portfolio includes one issued US patent which will remain in force until 2030, and at least fifteen patents issued in other countries, including two European patents, three Korean patents, three Japanese patents and three Chinese patents, which expire in 2027. At least fifteen additional patent applications are pending, including three in the United States. 

The license agreement with the European Union has a term which runs until the final licensed patent expires, unless the agreement is terminated earlier by mutual consent of the parties or for breach. The Company is currently in compliance with the terms of this license agreement. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours. 

&#160;

There are many competitive offerings in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Several companies have launched devices that enable reduced incision or single incision laparoscopic surgery with or without robotic assistance. Our surgical competitors include, but are not limited to: Applied Medical, Medtronic plc, Intuitive Surgical, Titan Medical, Google and Johnson &#38; Johnson. 

In addition to surgical device manufacturer competitors, there are many products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. These products and therapies may impact the overall volume of surgical procedures and negatively impact our business. 

In addition, our ability to compete may be affected by the failure to fully educate physicians in the use of our products and products in development, or by the level of physician expertise. This may have the effect of making our products less attractive. Among currently available surgical robotic systems, we expect the ALF-X System to differentiate on the basis of its use of standard trocars and lower per procedures costs; we expect the SurgiBot System, once cleared and marketed, to differentiate on the basis of internal triangulation and positioning of the surgeon within the sterile field, as well as a lower capital cost; and we expect each of our systems to differentiate, in most cases, and their ability to provide the surgeon with tactile feedback. Several medical device companies are actively engaged in research and development of robotic systems or other medical devices and tools used in minimally invasive surgery procedures. We cannot predict the basis upon which we will compete with new products marketed by others. 

Government Regulation of our Product Development Activities 

The U.S. government regulates the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to, the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#147;FDCA&#148;). The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. 

Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval 

Medical devices are subject to varying levels of pre-market regulatory requirements. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: (i) Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls; (ii) Class II devices are somewhat more complex and receive greater scrutiny from the FDA and have heightened regulatory requirements; and (iii) Class III devices are new, high risk devices, and frequently are permanently implantable or help sustain life and generally require a Pre-Market Approval (&#147;PMA&#148;) by the FDA. 

In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new medical device in one of two ways. The first applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 1976, or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device. These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. To obtain FDA clearance to distribute the medical device, a company generally must submit a Section 510(k) notification, and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 1976 device or post-May 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that medical device for its intended use. A 510(k) notification must provide information supporting a claim of substantial equivalence to a single medical device, the predicate device. If clinical 

&#160;

data from human experience are required to support the 510(k) notification, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption (&#147;IDE&#148;) regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The 510(k) process is normally used for products of the type that we are developing and propose to market and sell. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) takes, pursuant to statutory requirements, 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has questions regarding the regulatory submission. It is possible for Section 510(k) clearance procedures to take from six to twenty-four months, depending on the concerns raised by the FDA and the complexity of the device. There is no guarantee that the FDA will &#147;clear&#148; a medical device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. There is also no guarantee that the FDA will deem the applicable device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource-intensive and problematic PMA process described below. In 2011, the FDA issued a series of draft guidance documents designed to reform the 510(k) clearance process. Similarly, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 authorized the FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain pre-market submissions received on or after October 1, 2012, including 510(k) notifications. 

The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 product or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the approval process as a Class III device. Two steps of FDA approval are generally required before a company can market a product in the United States that is subject to approval, as opposed to clearance, as a Class III device. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device. These regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a &#147;non-significant risk&#148; device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. Second, the FDA must approve the company&#146;s PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. Additionally, devices subject to PMA approval may be subject to a panel review to obtain marketing approval and are required to pass a factory inspection in accordance with the current &#147;good manufacturing practices&#148; standards in order to obtain approval. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more. However, in some instances the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances FDA may allow a device to be down classified from Class III to Class I or II. The de novo classification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a &#147;not substantially equivalent&#148; (&#147;NSE&#148;) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The regulations have also been amended to allow a sponsor to submit a de novo classification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as &#147;Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation&#148; or &#147;de novo.&#148; In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a de novo application which may lead to delays in regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a de novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and worthy of either an exempt or 510(k) regulatory pathway. 

We believe that the ALF-X System and the SurgiBot System, and related products to both systems, are Class II devices, and we are in the process of pursuing Section 510(k) clearance for the SurgiBot System. The FDA might find that the 510(k) submission does not provide the evidence required to prove that the SurgiBot System is substantially equivalent to marketed Class II devices. If that were to occur, we would be required to undertake the more complex and costly PMA process or perhaps be considered for a de novo reclassification. All of these risks also exist for the ALF-X System, which we plan to gain U.S. market access from the FDA in the future. For either the 510(k), de novo, or the PMA process, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials, which would take more time, cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties. 

&#160;

Clinical studies conducted in the U.S. or used in any U.S. application on an unapproved medical device require approval from the FDA prior to initiation. Even when a clinical study has been approved by the FDA or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer&#146;s control, including, but not limited to, the fact that the institutional review board (IRB) at a specified clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval, or might suspend or terminate the study before its completion. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated. In addition, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under Section 510(k). Even if the FDA approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distribution of the device may not be commercially feasible. 

After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain serious adverse events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval of the device, or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met. 

A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement, prior to marketing the modified device. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through the 510(k) process must submit an additional premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, labeling or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or new cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements. 

Continuing FDA Regulation 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; quality system regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. &#147;off label,&#148; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requirements to conduct postmarket surveillance studies to establish continued safety data. We are required to, and have, registered with the FDA and ISO as medical device manufacturers and must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation (&#147;QSR&#148;) and other regulations. 

In Europe, we need to comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (&#147;MDD&#148;) and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To achieve compliance, our products must meet the &#147;Essential Requirements&#148; of the MDD relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo verification of our regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment, by a notified body selected by us. The level of scrutiny of such assessment depends on the regulatory class of the product. We are subject to continued surveillance by our notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certifications in order to sell products. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing, labeling and control activities. 

Impact of Regulation 

Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modifications to existing products; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; criminal prosecution; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; disgorgement of profits. Further, the levels of revenues and profitability of medical device companies like us may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls. 

&#160;

Therefore, we cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective, or that, following any commercialization of our products, coverage and reimbursement will be available or sufficient to allow us to manufacture and sell them competitively and profitably. 

Health Care Regulation 

Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

In the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. At the current time, our products are not defined as durable medical equipment (&#147;DME&#148;). Non-DME devices used in surgical procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payors. Instead, the hospital or health care provider is reimbursed based on the procedure performed and the inpatient or outpatient stay. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals, ASCs and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell. 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#147;Affordable Care Act&#148;) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the &#147;Reconciliation Act,&#148; and, with the Affordable Care Act, the &#147;2010 Health Care Reform Legislation&#148;). The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed on June 28, 2012 by the Supreme Court of the United States. Specifically, the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate and included changes regarding the extension of medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. Thus, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation has changed the existing state of the health care system by expanding coverage through voluntary state Medicaid expansion, attracting previously uninsured persons through the new health care insurance exchanges and by modifying the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices, such as our products. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of third-party payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or some combination of both, as well as other changes. 

The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. This excise tax was suspended in December 2015 for two years. If eventually implemented, this excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future. 

Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or &#147;transfers of value&#148; provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We 

&#160;

provided our first reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;) during 2014 and the first public disclosure of the Open Payments data by CMS occurred in September 2014. The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation. 

Regulations under the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation have been, and are expected to continue to be, drafted, released and finalized throughout the next several years. The full impact of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, as well as laws and other reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. 

International Regulation and Potential Impact 

Through the ALF-X Acquisition, the Company has expanded into international markets and intends to pursue continued expansion. Some of these markets maintain unique regulatory requirements outside of or in addition to those of the U.S. FDA and the European Union. Due to the variations in regulatory requirements within territories, the Company may be required to perform additional safety or clinical testing or fulfill additional agency requirements for specific territories. The Company may also be required to apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may be dependent upon the third parties&#146; successful regulatory processes to file, register and list the product applications and associated labeling. These additional requirements may result in delays in international registrations and commercialization of our products in certain countries. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 132 employees, including 130 full time employees. The Company considers its relationships with its employees to be good.
