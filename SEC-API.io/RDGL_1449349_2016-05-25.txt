 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

General Statement of Business 

&#160; 

Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;AMI&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on December 23, 1994 as Savage Mountain Sports Corporation (&#8220;SMSC&#8221;). On September 6, 2006, the Company changed its name to Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation. AMI has authorized capital of 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (ADMD: OTCQB). 

&#160; 

AMI is a late stage radiation oncology focused medical device company engaged in the development of yttrium-90 based brachytherapy devices for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. Brachytherapy uses radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive isotope inside or next to the treatment area. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company&#8217;s development efforts. AMI has been recognized as a leader in the development of new isotope technologies by local, state and federal agencies. The Company&#8217;s overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that offer safe and effective treatments for cancer. 

&#160; 

Since late 2013, AMI has focused its resources on developing a proposed line of yttrium-90 based brachytherapy products for the treatment of non-resectable tumors and on endeavoring to secure FDA clearance with respect to the initial proposed brachytherapy product. AMI&#8217;s proposed brachytherapy products incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle Memorial Institute (&#8220;Battelle&#8221;) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted AMI an exclusive license to patents covering these developments for manufacturing, processing and applications for medical isotopes (the &#8220;Battelle License&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s lead product is the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. The Company is currently conducting additional bench and animal tests requested by the FDA to support a new de novo filing with the FDA that would request marketing clearance for the device as a Class II medical device in the United States. The Company is also exploring the pathway to regulatory clearance in other international markets. 

&#160; 

In March of 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, IsoPet Solutions Corporation, to focus on the vibrant and expanding veterinary oncology market. IsoPet Solutions will focus on bringing AMI's yttrium-90 brachytherapy products to veterinary oncologists to treat animals such as dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers. IsoPet Solutions is currently establishing the infrastructure necessary to provide product to veterinary clinics including regulatory clearances and compliance. 

&#160; 

Research and development of the Company&#8217;s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities as well as a series of grants. On October 28, 2010, the Company received $1,215,000 net proceeds from a Department of Energy grant for the Proposed Congressionally Directed Project entitled &#8220;Research to Develop and Test an Advanced Resorbable Brachytherapy Seed Research for Controlled Delivery of Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Cancer Treatment.&#8221; On October 29, 2010, the Company received notification it had been awarded $244,479 grant funds from the Qualified Therapeutic Discovery Project Program for this same Brachytherapy Project. Additionally, on September 1, 2015, the Company received notification it had been awarded from Washington State University, $42,019 grant funds from the sub-award project entitled &#8220;Optimized Injectable Radiogels for High-dose Therapy of Non-Resectable Solid Tumors&#8221;.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company requires funding of approximately $1.5 million annually to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12-24 months, the Company believes it will cost approximately $5 million to $10 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial deployment of the brachytherapy products and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued deployment of the brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel. The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12-24 months will be the FDA&#8217;s classification of the Company&#8217;s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company&#8217;s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company&#8217;s arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products&#8217; success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or additional capital raises. 

&#160; 

Following receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing, in the United States, the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing. Outside of the United States, the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to facilitate its global commercialization strategy. 

&#160; 

In the longer-term, subject to the Company receiving adequate funding, regulatory approval for brachytherapy products and thereafter being successful in commercializing brachytherapy products, the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies. The Company&#8217;s core goal is to develop and commercialize isotopes, businesses and technologies intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses. Among those longer-term projects being considered by the Company are potential solutions for the impending severe shortages of Molybendum-99 and its derivative product Technetium-99m, the most widely used isotopes for diagnostic purposes. 

&#160; 

Based on the Company&#8217;s financial history since inception, its auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to delay the implementation of its business strategy and not be able to continue operations. 

&#160; 

In April 2015 the Company announced the beginning of its capital restructuring plan. This included reaching an agreement with its primary lender, Carlton Cadwell, and his affiliated entities to convert $5 million of long term debt into a newly designated series of equity based convertible preferred stock as well as having, several other lenders agree to these debt conversion terms. The Company also successfully eliminated approximately $500,000 of seasoned trade payables. 

&#160; 

The Company also provided an update on additional matters to significantly simplify the Company's capital structure and improve its balance sheet. The Company reported that in November and December of 2014, in connection with the conversion of certain convertible debt and exercise of warrants, there was an error in the calculation of common shares that should have properly been issued, resulting in significant excess issuances of common stock. The miscalculations were the result of conversions and exercises being executed below the Company's stated par value of $0.001. The transfer agent erroneously issued excess freely tradable common shares based on defective legal opinions provided by the respective note and warrant holders. In order to remedy the situation, the Company notified all applicable convertible note and warrant holders of the excess issuance and has proposed specific solutions to facilitate compliance with the State of Delaware and federal securities laws. Specifically, the investors may either deliver to the transfer agent the excess shares they were issued, or they may offset any remaining convertible debt or warrants to satisfy proper consideration for the excess common shares issued. The Company reported it believed that these actions will have a positive impact on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet, potentially eliminating up to $800,000 of convertible debt, potentially eliminating a substantial portion of the warrants outstanding and potentially eliminating a substantial amount of the nearly $11 million of derivative liabilities then outstanding. The obligations that were resolved as of December 31, 2015 are reflected in the year-end financial statements. The obligations resolved subsequent to the end of 2015 are detailed in the subsequent events section of the year-end financial statement. 

&#160; 

On June 24, 2015 the Company provided an update on financial matters and stated that it intends to pursue an uplisting transaction as part of its financial recapitalization plan to raise the capital necessary to complete the direct de novo FDA filing for the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device and to pursue commercialization and partnering efforts. 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2015, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220; Certificate of Designations &#8221;) with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 2.5 million shares of the Company&#8217;s preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220; Series A Preferred &#8221;). A Certificate of Amendment was filed on March 31, 2016 authorizing 5 million shares. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2015 the Company announced a collaboration with IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC of Angleton, TX on the preclinical development of Y-90 based brachytherapy products including AMICs Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. 

&#160; 

In the third quarter, the Company reported it completed a variety of initiatives that significantly reduced the Company&#8217;s debt. Dr. Carlton Cadwell and his related entities exchanged an aggregate of $5,338,940 of debt into 355,929 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred. The 305,929 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred converts into 355,929,000 Common shares, at an effective conversion price of $0.015 per share. In addition to the debt conversion, Dr. Cadwell exchanged $1,055,532 of short term debt for a new long term 8% non-convertible note payable upon demand on March 31, 2017. Such note was converted into 73,546 Series A preferred shares on May 19, 2016. Substantially all of the holders of the short term bridge loans have converted their debt into Series A preferred shares. Separately, substantially all of the toxic debt has either been satisfied and removed from the company&#8217;s balance sheet or is in the process of finalizing settlement documentation. The Company noted it commenced studies with IsoTherapeutics Group pursuant to the FDA request for further studies and specific manufacturing plans for the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. 

&#160; 

In the fourth quarter, the Company announced its progress in seeking FDA clearance for marketing of its lead product, the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. CEO Jim Katzaroff and the lead scientific and medical advisory team from the Company met at the FDA offices to discuss next steps, expectations and required testing to progress towards obtaining marketing clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. The Company reported it is working closely with the FDA in order to obtain all appropriate data and benchmarks the FDA requires in order to proceed with providing final clearance for marketing the device in the United States. The Company reported it intends to seek classification and clearance as a class II medical device through a de novo application. The Company also announced that its product development partner IsoTherapeutics had completed the first stage of the project, comprised of tech transfer, manufacturing and in vitro testing. 

&#160; 

2016 Significant Events 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016 the Company&#8217;s Founder, Chairman and CEO co-authored an article published in the January, 2016 issue of the World Council on Isotopes (WCI) Newsletter. The WCI was founded in 2008 and has a global membership from over 50 countries consisting of 103 member organizations and 40 individual members. WCI provides a strong voice, as an internationally recognized non-governmental organization, at important regional and international forums. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company added two members to its Medical Advisory board, Dr. Ludwig E. Feinendegen, M.D. and Dr. Albert S. DeNittis, MD, MS, FCPP. Dr. Ludwig E. Feinendegen is a medical doctor known for his pioneering work and leadership in the fields of both diagnostic and therapeutic applications of radionuclides through various roles and research in nuclear medicine, internal medicine, cell biology and radiobiology. Dr. Feinendegen has numerous honors from national and international institutions and has authored over 700 publications in molecular nuclear medicine, cell biology and low-dose radiobiology. Dr. Albert S.

Dr. DeNittis has served on numerous regional, national and government committees related to key issues in the field of oncology including the NRG Oncology group which focuses on protocol development for cancer patients on the national level. He has received regional and national awards for his research and his clinical work and authored over 100 publications and presentations as well as 6 book chapters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced the formation of a new, wholly-owned subsidiary, IsoPet Solutions Corporation, to focus on the vibrant and expanding veterinary oncology market. The IsoPet Solutions division will focus on bringing the Company&#8217;s yttrium-90 brachytherapy products to veterinary oncologists to treat dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers. The division will also provide product awareness and education to veterinary oncologists. Dr. Alice Villalobos, DVM, FNAP, a specialist and advocate on the topic of cancer in pets, was appointed Chair of the Company's Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board. 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the reporting period, in support of the Company&#8217;s efforts to focus resources on the development and commercialization of its yttrium-90 brachytherapy products, the Company permanently closed its Production Facility located in Kennewick Washington. The key piece of equipment, the Company&#8217;s linear accelerator is currently being marketed for sale.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Collaborations 

&#160; 

The Company is engaged in collaborative efforts with U.S. national laboratories and universities and with international teaming partners. The Company has active research collaborations for its brachytherapy products with Washington State University and the University of Utah as well as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, operated by Battelle. 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2015 the Company announced a collaboration with IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC of Angleton, TX on the preclinical development of Y-90 based brachytherapy products including AMICs Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Brachytherapy 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Battelle License, the Company has licensed certain exclusive rights to yttrium-90 (Y-90) polymer composite technology developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. The license agreement grants the Company the exclusive right to manufacture and market products using the yttrium-90 isotope carried by an injectable water-based biodegradable polymer. The use of yttrium 90 (Y-90) for the treatment of cancers is well established. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States and analogous regulators outside of the United States, the Company plans to introduce a new Y-90-based brachytherapy product line for a range of applications for the delivery of a prescribed dose of radiation to a target site. If the Company receives FDA clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device, subject to receipt of adequate financing, the Company will commence production, sales, and distribution of that product. Also, subject to receipt of adequate financing, the Company intends then to seek FDA clearance for the two additional products described below, each of which also incorporates the patented technologies licensed from Battelle. Even if the FDA grants clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device there can be no assurance the FDA would also grant clearance for either or both of the foregoing products. 

&#160; 

Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device - combines Y-90 particles with a polymer carrier that may be injected directly into the tumor. 

&#160; 

Y-90 Fast-Resorbable Polymer Seeds &#160;- Y-90 contained within a polymer seed, as opposed to metal or glass. This product would be used in place of treating cancers with currently marketed titanium or glass seeds. 

&#160; 

Y-90 Polymer Topical Paste &#160;&#8211; designed to be applied directly to tissue surfaces after surgical tumor removals (also referred to as &#8220;resections&#8221;) to treat residual tumor cells. 

&#160; 

Based upon its studies and analyses, or general application of experience with current brachytherapy devices and yttrium-90, the Company believes that if it is able to obtain regulatory approval and adequate financing to commercialize our products, our brachytherapy products are likely to offer the following benefits, among others, for patients and medical professionals: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Maximizing Therapeutic Index: The short-range beta particles emitted by Y-90 deliver radiation energy within a tight range. This enables radiation to be selectively delivered to target tissues while minimizing radiation dose to nearby normal tissues. High therapeutic indices imply that more radiation energy may be imparted to cancer tissues, with less radiation reaching adjacent normal tissues. &#160; 

&#9679; Half Life: The industry-standard products have a half-life of 17 days, meaning the patient is radioactive for over two months. The Company&#8217;s brachytherapy products use the yttrium-90 isotope, which has a half-life of just 2.7 days. A patient treated with Y-90 would be close to radiation free in 10 days. &#160; 

&#9679; Optimized Delivery Method: Current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal particles seeds in the prostate by using up to 30 large gauge needles. By contrast, the Company&#8217;s biodegradable polymer carrying Y-90 particles may be administered with small-gauge needles. &#160; 

&#9679; No Permanent Seeds Remaining: Other brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the tumor. The Company&#8217;s Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device utilizes a biodegradable, non-toxic polymer that is ultimately absorbed by the body. This eliminates the possibility of a long-term seed migration or other problems that may sometimes arise when seeds remain in the body. &#160; 

&#9679; Good Safety Profile: Many current brachytherapy devices utilize isotopes that emit x-rays (akin to gamma radiation). X-rays or gamma radiation travels within and outside of the body and the isotopes used in current brachytherapy products can remain radioactive for more than two months. The Company&#8217;s brachytherapy products use the yttrium-90 isotope, which is a beta-emitter. The yttrium-90 beta-emissions travel only a short distance and have a short half life of 2.7 days. &#160; 

In June 2015, the FDA notified the Company that the de novo submitted on December 23, 2014 for its Y-90 RadioGel&#8482; device pursuant to Section 513(f)(2) of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;)was not accepted. The Company had several formal and informal interactions with the FDA during the second half of 2015 to clarify the agency&#8217;s expectations for data and testing to be provided in a future filing. The Company has incorporated the feedback from the FDA into its continued and active product development and commercialization efforts, utilizing its partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

Competitors and Markets 

&#160; 

There are established competitors in all of the markets in which the Company has products or currently plans to have products. 

&#160; 

Brachytherapy 

&#160; 

Brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area. According to the 2014 MEDraysintell report, the global market for brachytherapy reached US$ 680 million in 2013 and is projected to reach $2.4 billion by 2030. It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market. The Company believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers. The 2014 U.S. estimated new cases of cancer according to the American Cancer Society are 233,000 prostate, 235,030 breast, 31,190 liver, and 46,420 pancreas. 

&#160; 

There are a wide variety of cancer treatments approved and marketed in the U.S. and globally. General categories of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. These products have a diverse set of success rates and side effects. The Company&#8217;s products fall into a particular type of radiation therapy called brachytherapy. There are a number of brachytherapy devices currently marketed in the U.S. and globally. The traditional iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) technologies for brachytherapy are well entrenched with powerful market players controlling the market. The industry-standard I-125-based therapy was developed by Oncura, which is a unit of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Additionally, C.R. Bard, a major industry player competes in the I-125 brachytherapy marketplace. These market competitors are also involved in the distribution of Pd-103 based products. Cs-131 brachytherapy products are sold by IsoRay (AMEX:ISR). Several Y-90 therapies have been FDA approved including SIR-Spheres by Sirtex (OTC:SXMDF), TheraSphere by Biocompatibles UK (OTC:BCTBF) and Zevalin by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI). 

&#160; 

Veterinary Brachytherapy 

&#160; 

There are about 150 million pet dogs and cats in the United States. Nearly half of dogs and one third of cats are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. The Veterinary Oncology &#38; Hermatology Center in Norwalk, CT reports that cancer is the number one natural cause of death in older cats and dogs, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports that half of the dogs ten years or older will die because of cancer. The National Cancer Institute reports that about six million dogs are diagnosed with cancer each year, translating to more than 16,000 a day. The average cost of treating tumors in dogs using radiation is $5,000-7,000 according to petcarerx.com. 

&#160; 

There are oncology treatments available currently in the U.S. and globally for the veterinary market represent a similar, but smaller set of products than is available for the human market. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had six employees, including three full-time employees. The Company utilizes eight to ten independent contractors to assist with its operations.
