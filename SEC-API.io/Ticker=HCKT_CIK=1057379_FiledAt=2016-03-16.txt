 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, &#8220;Hackett,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to The Hackett Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries and predecessors. We were originally incorporated on April 23, 1997. 

The Hackett Group is an intellectual property-based strategic consultancy and leading enterprise benchmarking and best practices implementation firm to global companies. Services include business transformation, enterprise performance management , working capital management , and global business services . The Hackett Group also provides dedicated expertise in business strategy, operations, finance, human capital management, strategic sourcing, procurement, and information technology, including its award-winning Oracle EPM and SAP practices. 

The Hackett Group has completed more than 12 ,000 benchmarking and performance studies with major organizations, including 93% of the Dow Jones Industrials, 86% of the Fortune 100, 87% of the DAX 30 and 52% of the FTSE 100. These studies drive its Best Practice Intelligence Center&#8482; which includes the firm's benchmarking metrics, best practices repository , and best practice configuration and process flows accelerators, which enable The Hackett Group&#8217;s clients and partners to achieve world-class performance. 

In the US, we continued to experience strong demand for our services under lower than expected GDP growth conditions for the year. In Western Europe, corporate decision making continued to be volatile throughout the year across our primary markets leading to lower than planned demand and operating results. Given our strong US client base, the activity in the US more than offset the European volatility. As we enter 2016, we expect U.S. market conditions to continue to be healthy. Relative to International, which is primarily Western Europe, we expect activity to be volatile. We expect approximately 2.0% GDP growth in the U.S., consistent with the two previous years; however, we remain cautious about our expectations for improved demand in Western Europe, but we know most recent growth revision for the region calls for approximately 1 % GDP growth . Global organizations continue to recognize the need to drive sustainable productivity improvement as they look to be competitive in a global macro-economic environment with restricted growth . Global growth opportunities require organizations to build global standards and to drive operating excellence based on the regional growth opportunities defined by the markets that they serve. Many organizations continue to make the global and regional organizational changes commensurate with the varying regional market conditions. We believe that our offerings are well aligned with the demands that all organizations will continue to experience during a period of slow and volatile economic growth. We will continue to ensure that our clients understand that our unique best practices intellectual capital, along with our expanding implementation capabilities will enable them to identify and implement necessary performance improvement initiatives in a targeted and timely manner. 

When this economic backdrop is coupled with the rapidly emerging digital transformation age that we are just entering, there is a convergence underway that has the potential to transform existing industries and companies. Cloud-based infrastructure and applications, virtual business and technology networks, and business analytics are coming together with rapidly transitioning employee and consumer bases that are increasingly adept to new mobile technologies and business models. This convergence is creating tremendous new opportunities for companies that can transform and take advantage of them. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The traditional approach to business transformation is based on a model of value creation involving optimization of linear processes and execution of work. This model no longer adequately reflects the reality of today&#8217;s digitally-connected world, which revolves around digital value networks as opposed to traditional value chains. A second critical element of digital age value creation is customer-centricity. A new digital business transformation framework needs to be adopted that goes beyond the traditional and more linear people/process/technology model and reflects customer-centricity and value networks. Such a framework must be customer value aligned, best practice oriented, continuous and technology- and people-led. Uber is a prime example of a customer-centric value network, disrupting traditional industries. 

These emerging organizational models, driven by new technologies, will require organizations to re-evaluate their current operating platform, go-to-market strategies and consider emerging market opportunities. To do so, organizations will have to understand and decide how best to organize, enable, source and manage their business while both leveraging and utilizing emerging technologies. This will place increased emphasis on risk management and tangible return on their business and technological investments. We believe large enterprises will continue to focus their performance improvement spending on strategies and tools that help them generate more value from their business investments in the form of enhanced productivity and efficiency. We also expect companies to continue to look for ways to automate workflow, centralize and standardize execution. We believe that our unique insight into how leading global companies continue to excel and effectively adopt new technologies will continue to assist our clients with existing and emerging operating considerations. 

OUR PROPRIETARY BEST PRACTICE IMPLEMENTATION INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL 

Hackett uses its proprietary Best Practice Implementation (&#8220;BPI&#8221;) intellectual capital to help clients improve their performance. Our benchmark offerings allow clients to empirically quantify their performance improvement opportunity at an actionable level. It also provides us visibility into how leading global companies deploy technology or organizational strategies to optimize their performance. This insight results in a proprietary Best Practices Repository and with software configuration and organizational strategies which are only available from the unique vantage point provided from our Benchmarking solution. Utilizing the benchmarking metrics and repository of best practices, combined with the global strategy and implementation insight of our transformation and technology associates, Hackett has also created a series of organizational and technology accelerators that allow clients to effect proven sustainable performance improvement. Our proprietary BPI intellectual capital, which is imbedded within our consulting global delivery methodology, allows us to help clients accelerate their time to benefit from these improvements. 

Our BPI approach leverages our inventory of Hackett-Certified&#8482; practices, observed through benchmark and other BPI engagements, to correlate best practices with superior performance levels. We utilize Capability Maturity Models to better understand our client&#8217;s capabilities and organizational maturity, so that we can determine the level of performance that they can realistically pursue. In addition, we utilize Hackett&#8217;s intellectual capital in the form of best practice process flows and software configuration guides to integrate Hackett&#8217;s empirically proven best practices directly into business processes and workflows that are enabled by enterprise software applications. The repository of best practice process flows and software configuration guides reside in the Best Practice Intelligence Center portal and are used on a project to ensure that best practices are identified and implemented, whenever possible. This coordinated approach addresses people, process, information and technology all within the framework of our Best Practices 

Because Hackett solutions are based on Hackett-Certified&#8482; best practices, we believe that clients gain significant advantages. Clients can have confidence that their solutions are based on strategies from the world&#8217;s leading companies. More importantly, Hackett solutions deliver enhanced efficiency, improved effectiveness and reduced implementation risk. 

The BPI approach often begins with a clear understanding of current performance, which is normally gained through benchmarking key processes and comparing the results to world-class levels and industry standards captured in the Hackett database. We then help clients prioritize and select the appropriate best practices to implement through a coordinated performance improvement strategy. Without a coordinated strategy that addresses the seven key business components which include organization and governance, process design, process sourcing, service placement, information, enabling technology and skills and talent, we believe companies risk losing a significant portion of business case benefits of their investments. We have designed detailed best practice process flows based on Hackett&#8217;s deep knowledge of world-class business performance which enable clients to streamline and automate key processes, and generate performance improvements quickly and efficiently at both the functional and enterprise level. 

Similarly, we integrate Hackett-Certified&#8482; best practices directly into technology solutions. We believe it is imperative that companies simplify and automate processes to meet best practice standards before new technology implementations and upgrades are completed. The automation of inefficient processes only serves to continue to drive up costs, cycle times and error rates. We have completed detailed fit-gap analyses in most functional areas of major business application packages including Oracle and SAP to determine their ability to support best practices. Application-specific tools, implementation guides and process flows allow us to optimize the configuration of best of breed software, while limiting customization. BPI establishes the foundation for improved performance. 

We believe the combination of optimized processes, best practice-based business applications and enhanced business intelligence environments allow our clients to achieve and sustain significant business performance improvement. The specific client 

&#160;

&#160; 

circumstances normally dictate how they engage us. Our goal is to be responsive to client needs, and to establish a continuous and trusted relationship. We have developed a series of offerings that allow us to efficiently help the client without regard to where they are in their performance improvement lifecycle. 

COMPETITION 

The strategic business advisory and technology consulting marketplace continues to be extremely competitive. The marketplace will remain competitive as companies continue to look for ways to improve their organizational effectiveness. Our competitors include international accounting firms; international, national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms; and the IT services divisions of application software firms. Mergers and consolidations throughout our industry have resulted in higher levels of competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include skills and capabilities of people, innovative services and product offerings, perceived ability to add value, reputation and client references, price, scope of services, service delivery approaches, technical and industry expertise, quality of services and solutions, ability to deliver results on a timely basis, availability of appropriate resources, and global reach and scale. We acknowledge that many of our competitors are larger however we believe very few, if any, of our competitors have proprietary intellectual capital similar to the benchmarking based performance metrics and BPI insight that emanates from our Transformational Benchmark and Best Practices Advisory offerings. 

In spite of our size relative to our competitor group, we believe our competitive position is distinct. With Hackett&#8217;s best practice intellectual capital and its direct link to our BPI approach, we believe we can empirically and objectively assist our clients. Our ability to apply best practices to client operations via proven techniques is at the core of our competitive standing. 

Similarly, we believe that Hackett is the definitive source for best practice performance metrics and strategies. Hackett is the only organization that has conducted more than 12,000 benchmark and performance studies over 22 years at over 5,000 clients, generating proprietary data sets spanning performance metrics and correlating best practices with superior performance. The combination of Hackett benchmark data, along with deep expertise and knowledge in evaluating, designing and implementing business transformation strategies leveraging our proprietary Best Practices Repository, delivers a powerful and distinct value proposition for our clients. 

Our culture of client collaboration leverages the power of our cross-functional and service line teams to increase revenue and strengthen relationships. We believe that this culture, along with terrific talent and with our intellectual capital-centric approach, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. 

STRATEGY 

Our focus will be on executing the following strategies: 

&#183; 

Expand our brand or market permission to our other offerings. We believe that our long term growth prospects lie in our ability to extend our unique market permission to help clients and strategic partners measure their performance improvement opportunity, using our proprietary benchmark database into our other offerings. We have started to extend our permission through the strategic relationship that results from our Best Practices Advisory Programs. However, our most significant growth opportunity is in our ability to extend our brand and market permission into our enterprise transformation and other best practice implementation offerings which create a significant opportunity to grow revenue per client. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continue to position and grow Hackett as an IP-centric strategic advisory organization. We believe that the Hackett brand is widely recognized for benchmarking metrics and best practice strategies. By building a series of highly complementary on-site and off-site offerings that allow our client&#8217;s access to our Intellectual Property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) which is based on our best practice process and technology implementation insight, we are able to build trusted strategic relationships with our clients. Depending upon where our clients are in their assessment or implementation of performance improvement initiatives, we offer them a combination of offerings that support their efforts. If they need on-site planning, design and/or implementation support, we offer them a combination of benchmarking and transformation support. Our long term strategy is to continue to build our brand by building new offerings and capabilities around our unmatched Best Practice Implementa tion intellectual capital in order to serve clients strategically and whenever possible, continuously. 

&#160; 

We believe that clients that leverage our IP are more likely to allow us to serve them more broadly. IP-based services enhance our opportunities to serve clients remotely, continuously and more profitably. Our goal is to use our unique intellectual capital to establish a strategic relationship with our clients directly or through strategic alliances and channels and to further use that entry point to introduce our business transformation and technology capabilities. Our long-term goal is to be able to ascribe an increasing percentage of our total annual revenues to clients who are continuously engaged with us through our executive and best practices advisory programs, and through our Hackett Performance Exchange. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 our Executive and Best Practice Advisory Members totaled 960 across 305 clients. Consistent with prior quarters, over 40% of our Hackett sales were also Advisory clients, which continues to support the leverage of this entry or IP-wedge offering. 

&#160;

&#160; 

If they need off-site access to our IP and advisors to help them either assess or execute on their own, they can avail themselves of our Executive or Best Practices Advisory Programs. The key is for the client to know that we can support them strategically by leveraging our unique IP and insight so that we are able to build a strategic relationship which is appropriate for them. We also believe that clients that value our IP will turn to us for other services when the need arises, allowing us over time to ascribe a larger amount of our total revenue to a growing client base, which will improve the predictability of our results. What was clearly different as we entered 2015 is that we now see the potential to leverage our IP through new external strategic partners and their channels. We are now exploring ways to use our IP to help others sell and deliver their offerings, thereby extending the value add they deliver to their clients, and perhaps also providing us with an opportunity to introduce our other services. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Introduce New IP&#8211;centric Offerings. &#160; We are now seeing new opportunities through new strategic alliances and channels to use our IP to help others sell and deliver their offerings. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we launched a series of such alliances as described below: 

&#160; 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we launched a program with ADP that added a dedicated Hackett Best Practices advisory program to ADP&#8217;s Vantage HCM &#174; solution. Our early indications from the ADP sales force as well as their clients are very favorable. We already have several clients that are utilizing the new Hackett Best Practice program in their ADP Vantage implementations, we expect our pipeline as well as closed deals to build throughout the upcoming year. 

&#160; 

We also launched the Association of Certified GBS Professionals Program with CIMA, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. We believe this relationship will allow us to build an entirely new professional development business that provides globally recognized certifications for shared services and global business service professionals. Our plan is to augment our existing entry level program with an Executive level program next April and the Managerial level program by next July. At that time we will have our complete curriculum fully rolled out. We have over 20 clients who have already committed to a Pilot program and use our entry level course for the assessment. We believe our ability to ramp throughout the year will accelerate as we rollout the other two programs and clients complete initial pilot programs. 

&#160; 

Lastly, we also announced our new joint marketing plan with Oracle that will include the sale of the Hackett Performance Exchange along with the sale of Oracle&#8217;s new Business Intelligence Cloud Service or BICS. We have started to expose a large number of Oracle&#8217;s BI sales force to this joint offering which will continue throughout 2016. This program now has a few clients and we believe this activity will increase as Oracle becomes more familiar with both their new cloud solution as well as the integrated value of HPE. 

&#160; 

Our Benchmarking and Best Practice IP leverage strategy allows us to increase our client base, profitability and increase revenue per client. It would also represent an increase in recurring revenue at much higher margins due to the way these services are provided and contracted. 

&#160; 

We have developed a performance management dashboard called the Hackett Performance Exchange, (&#8220;HPE&#8221;). In 2013 and 2012, we worked closely with our participating launch member clients to validate our targeted functionality and value proposition. This new dashboard offering should allow us to benchmark and monitor the performance improvement opportunity of key operating processes. This offering securely extracts operating information directly from a client&#8217;s ERP system which allows them to measure and compare their performance to Hackett peer and world class standards. For clients that run current versions of Oracle and SAP software, this solution is fully automated, requiring limited client time to set up and populate and also provides for electronic access over various devices. In addition to HPE, we also continue to look for ways to leverage our proprietary &#8220;IP&#8221; through new offerings and other external channels. 

&#183; 

Continue to expand our BPI tools . BPI incorporates intellectual capital from Hackett into our implementation tools and techniques. For clients, the end results are tangible cost and performance gains and improved returns on their organizational and technology investments. Many clients attribute their decision to employ us based on our BPI approach and tools. Our objective is to help clients make smarter business process and software configuration decisions as a result of our BPI methods and knowledge. We are continuously updating our BPI content and tools through benchmarking, enterprise transformation and research activities. Additional BPI updates are also driven by new software releases that drive innovation in business process automation. In 2015, we invested in the automation and further integration of our various metrics, best practices and best practice acceleration tools. This effort will continue in 2016. 

&#183; 

Create strategic relationships that help us leverage and expand our Hackett intellectual capital base as well as grow our revenue. We continue to believe that there are other organizations which can help us grow revenue and intellectual capital consistent with our strategy. Such relationships include programs that we have executed with other consulting organizations, industry trade groups and software providers. 

&#183; 

Recruit and develop talent. As we continue to grow and realize the potential of our business model, it has become increasingly evident that the primary limit to our growth will be our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate associates. We continue to invest in associate development programs that are specifically targeted to improve our go-to-market and delivery execution. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage our offshore capabilities. Leveraging an offshore resource capability to support the delivery of our offerings has been a key strategy for our organization. Our facilities in Hyderabad, India and Montevideo, Uruguay (Oracle EPM business acquired in 2014) allow us to increase operational efficiencies and build targeted key capabilities that can appropriately support the delivery of our offerings and internal functional teams. 

&#183; 

Seek out strategic acquisitions. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that strengthen our ability to compete and expand our IP. We believe that our unique Hackett access and our BPI approach, coupled with our strong balance sheet and infrastructure, can be utilized to support a larger organization. We plan to pursue acquisitions that are accretive or have strong growth prospects, and most importantly, have strong synergy with our best practice intellectual capital focus. 

OUR OFFERINGS

Benchmarking Services 

Our benchmarking group dates back to 1991, and has measured and evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of enterprise functions for over 5,000 organizations globally. This includes 93% of the Dow Jones Industrials, 86% of the Fortune 100, 87% of the DAX 30 and 52% of the FTSE 100. Ongoing studies are conducted in a wide range of areas, including selling, general and administrative, finance, human resources, information technology , procurement, enterprise performance management, shared service centers and working capital management. Hackett has identified over 2,000 best practices for over 115 processes in these key functional areas and uses proprietary perfo rmance measurement tools and data collection processes that enable companies to complete the performance measurement cycle and identify and quantify improvement opportunities in as little as four weeks. Benchmarks are used by our clients to objectively establish priorities, generate organizational consensus, align compensation to establish performance goals, and develop the required business case for business and technology investments. 

&#183; 

Business Transformation 

Our Business Transformation programs help clients develop a coordinated strategy for achieving performance improvements across the enterprise. Our experienced teams utilize Hackett performance measurement data to link performance gains to industry best practices. Our strategic capabilities include operational assessments, process and organization design, change management and the effective application of technology. We combine best practices knowledge with business expertise and broad technology capabilities, which we believe enables our programs to optimize return on client investments in people, process, technology and information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Through REL, a global leader in generating cash flow improvement from working capital, we offer services which are designed to help companies improve cash flow from operations through improved working capital management, reduced costs and increased service quality. 

&#183; 

EPM &#38; BI Solutions

Our ERP Solutions group also includes a division responsible for the sale of the SAP suite of ERP applications. 

CLIENTS 

We focus on developing long-term client relationships with Global 2000 firms and other sophisticated buyers of business and IT consulting services. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, our ten most significant clients accounted for 24%, 21% and 20% of revenue, respect ively, and during 2015, our largest client generated 4% of total revenue and 3% of total revenue in 2014 and 2013 . We believe that we have achieved a high level of satisfaction across our client base. The responses to our client satisfaction surveys have been positive. We receive surveys from a significant number of our engagements which are utilized in a rigorous process to improve our delivery execution, sales processes, methodologies and training. 

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING 

Our extensive client base and relationships with Global 2000 firms remain our most significant sources of new business. Our revenue generation strategy is formulated to ensure that we are addressing multiple facets of business development. The categories below define our business development resources. Our primary goal is to continue to increase awareness of our brand which we have created around Hackett&#8217;s empirical knowledge capital and BPI in the extended enterprise that we now serve. We have a regional sales and market development effort in both North America and Europe, so we can better coordinate the sales and marketing messages from our various offerings. Our compensation programs for our associates reflect an emphasis on optimizing our total revenue relationship with our clients while continuing to emphasize the growth of our Executive Advisory Program clients. Our technology groups, we have continued to utilize Hackett intellectual capital that resides in our BPI tools as a way to differentiate the relationships we have with the software providers and with our clients. 

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES 

Although virtually all of our advisors and consultants have the ability to and are expected to contribute to new revenue opportunities, our primary internal business development resources are comprised of the following: 

&#183; 

The Leadership Team, Principals and Senior Directors are comprised of our senior leaders who have a combination of executive, regional, practice and anchor account responsibilities. In addition to their management responsibilities, this group of associates is responsible for growing the business by fostering executive-level relationships within accounts and leveraging their existing contacts in the marketplace. 

&#183; 

The Sales Organization is comprised of associates who are 100% dedicated to generating sales. They are deployed geographically in key markets, are primarily focused on developing new relationships and are aligned to our core practice areas within their target accounts. They also handle opportunities in their geographic territories as they arise. 

&#183; 

The Business Development Associates are comprised of trained groups of telemarketing specialists who are conversant with their respective solution areas. Lead generation is coordinated with our marketing and sales groups to ensure that our inbound and outbound efforts are synchronized with targeted marketing and sales programs. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The Delivery Organization is comprised of our billable associates who work at client locations. We encourage associates to pursue additional business development opportunities through their normal course of delivering existing projects thereby helping us expand our business within existing accounts. 

In addition to our business development resources, we have a corporate marketing and communications organization responsible for overseeing our marketing programs, public relations and employee communications activities. 

We have organized our market focus into the following categories: 

&#183; 

Strategic Accounts are comprised of large prospects and existing relationships which we believe will have a significant revenue relationship within the next 18 months. Strategic account criteria include the size of the company, industry affiliation, propensity to buy external consulting services and contacts within the account. The sales representative working closely with regional leadership is primarily responsible for identifying business opportunities in the account, acting as the single point of coordination for the client, and performing the general duties of account manager. 

&#183; 

Regional Accounts are accounts within a specified geographic location. These accounts mostly include large prospects, dormant clients, existing medium-sized clients and mid-tier market accounts and are handled primarily on an opportunistic basis, except for active clients where delivery teams are focused on driving additional revenue. 

&#183; 

Strategic Alliance Accounts are accounts that allow us to partner with organizations of greater scale or different skill sets or with software developers enabling all parties to jointly market their products and services to prospective clients. 

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 

Our management control systems are comprised of various accounting, billing, financial reporting, human resources, marketing and resource allocations systems, many of which are integrated with our knowledge management system, Mind~Share. We believe that Mind~Share significantly enhances our ability to serve our clients efficiently by allowing our knowledge-base to be shared by all associates worldwide on a real-time basis. Our well-developed, flexible, scalable infrastructure has allowed us to quickly integrate the new employees and business systems we have acquired. 

TALENT MANAGEMENT 

We fully believe that our culture fosters intellectual creativity, collaboration and innovation. We believe in building relationships with both our associates and clients. We believe the best solutions come from teams of diverse individuals addressing problems collectively and from multiple dimensions, including the business, technological and human dimensions. We believe that the most effective working environment is one where everyone is encouraged to contribute and is rewarded for that contribution. Our core values are the strongest expression of our working style and represent what we stand for. These core values are: 

&#183; 

Continuous development of our associates, our unique content business model and our knowledge base; 

&#183; 

Diversity of backgrounds, skills and experiences; 

&#183; 

Knowledge capture, contribution and utilization; and 

&#183; 

Collaboration with one another, our partners and our clients. 

Our human resources staff includes seasoned professionals in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific who support our practices by, among other things, administering our benefit programs and facilitating the hiring process. Our human resources staff also includes dedicated individuals who recruit consultants with both business and technology expertise. Our recruiting team supports our hiring process by focusing on the highest demand solution areas of our business to ensure an adequate pipeline of new associates. We also have an employee referral program, which rewards existing employees who source new hires. 

As of January 1, 2016, we had 971 associates, excluding subcontractors, 79% of whom were billable professionals. We do not have any associates that are subject to collective bargaining arrangements; however, in France our associates enjoy the benefit of certain government regulations based on industry classification. We have entered into nondisclosure and non-solicitation agreements with virtually all of our personnel. From time to time, we also engage consultants as independent contractors. 

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 

One important way we put our values into action is through our commitment to the communities where we work. The mission of our Community Councils, which operate in each of the cities where we have offices, is to strive to make the markets, communities and clients we serve better than how we found them. We do so by building a strong sense of community, with collaboration and personal interaction from all of our associates, through both volunteer and service programs and social gatherings. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We have obtained trademark registrations for The Hackett Group and Book of Numbers and various other names and logos, and we own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad. We believe that the establishment 

&#160;

&#160; 

of these marks is an important part to our strategy of expanding the brand recognition we have built around our empirical knowledge capital.
