Applied&#8217;s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Applied&#8217;s business and results of operations. 

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies 

Applied&#8217;s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including Germany, Israel, Italy, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia. Applied uses numerous vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts and assembly services for the manufacture and support of its products, including some systems being completed at customer sites. 

Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts; monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts; qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and ensuring quality and performance of parts. 

Research, Development and Engineering 

Applied&#8217;s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Applied&#8217;s significant investments in research, development and engineering (RD&#38;E) must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements. 

Applied&#8217;s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, certain outsourced RD&#38;E activities, process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the United States, India, China, Singapore and Taiwan. 

Applied&#8217;s investments in RD&#38;E for product development and engineering programs over the last three fiscal years were as follows: $1.5 billion &#32;( 14 percent &#32;of net sales) in fiscal 2016 , $1.5 billion &#32;( 15 percent &#32;of net sales) in fiscal 2015 , and $1.4 billion &#32;( 16 percent &#32;of net sales) in fiscal 2014 . Applied has spent an average of 15 &#32;percent of net sales in RD&#38;E over the last five years. In addition to RD&#38;E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials research, environmental control and product ideation.

Competition 

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied&#8217;s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology, continually improve its products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation, productivity, cost-effectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base. The importance of these factors varies according to customers&#8217; needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all areas of Applied&#8217;s business. Competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversified companies. Applied&#8217;s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&#38;E, marketing and sales, and global customer support activities. Management believes that many of Applied&#8217;s products have strong competitive positions. 

The competitive environment for each segment is described below. 

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with increased capability, particularly mobility devices such as smartphones and tablets. The growth of data and new innovations such as augmented and virtual reality and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, new materials and an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors. Applied offers a variety of technologically-differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers&#8217; requirements in order to compete effectively in the marketplace. Applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products. There are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry, which has experienced increasing consolidation. Some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines, and range from suppliers serving a single region to global, diversified companies. The competitive environment for Semiconductor Systems in fiscal 2016 reflected steady overall demand for semiconductor equipment, with continued investments by memory customers in technology upgrades and additional capacity, reflecting primarily the transition from planar technology to 3D architectures. Demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes, driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. 

Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment complement Semiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets segments&#8217; products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete effectively, Applied offers products and services to improve tool performance, lower overall cost of ownership, and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers&#8217; fab operations. Significant competitive factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these factors varies according to customers&#8217; needs and the type of products or services offered. Industry conditions that affected Applied Global Services&#8217; sales of spares and services in fiscal 2016 were principally semiconductor manufacturers&#8217; wafer starts and factory utilization rates. 

Products in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in Asia. Applied holds established market positions with its technically-differentiated LCD and OLED manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color filter PVD, PVD array, PVD touch panel, and TFT array testing, although its market position could change quickly due to customers&#8217; evolving requirements. The Company has also entered a new business in yield control with its new inline e-beam review (EBR) system. The competitive environment for the Display and Adjacent Markets Groups in fiscal 2016 was characterized by increasing demand for manufacturing equipment for high-end mobile devices and continued demand for TV manufacturing equipment, although the TV manufacturing equipment sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions. Important factors affecting the competitive position of Applied&#8217;s Display and Adjacent Markets products include: industry trends, Applied&#8217;s ability to innovate and develop new products, and the extent to which Applied&#8217;s products are technically-differentiated, as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and Applied&#8217;s existing position at these customers. 

Patents and Licenses 

Applied&#8217;s competitive position significantly depends upon its research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, as well as its patent position. Protection of Applied&#8217;s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including patents, is important. Applied&#8217;s practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that it considers significant. Applied has approximately 10,200 patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of its business. In addition to its patents, Applied possesses other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and copyrights. 

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of its products, of certain patented technologies. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been, and are not expected to be, material to Applied&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. 

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Environmental Matters 

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health, and safety programs that are primarily preventative in nature. As part of these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental, health, or safety incidents, including, but not limited to, spills, releases, or possible contamination. 

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, remedial agreements, and other actions relating to the environment have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on Applied&#8217;s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations. 

The most recent report on Applied&#8217;s environmental, health and safety activities can be found in Applied&#8217;s latest Citizenship Report on its website at http://www.appliedmaterials.com/company/corporate-responsibility/reports. The Citizenship Report is updated periodically. This website address is intended to be an inactive textual reference only. None of the information on, or accessible through, Applied&#8217;s website is part of this Form 10-K or is incorporated by reference herein. 

Employees 

At October 30, 2016 , Applied employed approximately 15,600 &#32;regular employees and 1,100 &#32;temporary employees. In the high-technology industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense. Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees.
