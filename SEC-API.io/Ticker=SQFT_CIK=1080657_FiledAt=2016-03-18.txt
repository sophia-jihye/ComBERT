ITEM 1. 

OVERVIEW

NetREIT, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Maryland corporation which operates as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust as defined under the Internal Revenue Code (a&#8220; REIT &#8221;).

The Company sold all seven of its self-storage facilities (&#8220;Self-Storage Properties&#8221;) which totaled approximately 652,000 rentable square feet on April 10, 2015 for a net sales price of $34.0 million.

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

We were incorporated in the State of California on September 28, 1999, and in August 2010, we reincorporated as a Maryland chartered corporation. During the last five years, we have increased our investments in real property from 13 to 26 properties. Through NetREIT, Inc., its subsidiaries and its partnerships, we own 23 properties in fee interest and have partial interests in 3 properties through our investments in limited partnerships for which we serve as the General Partner. Each of the limited partnerships is referred to as a &#8220; DownREIT &#8221;. In each DownREIT, we have the right, through options and put options, to require our co-investors to exchange their interests for shares of our common stock at a stated price within a definite period, generally five years from the date they first invested in the entity&#8217;s real property. Through NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, Inc. and NetREIT Model Homes LLC, we also fully own or have an interest in 64 model home properties (the &#8220; Model Homes &#8221; ). 

MARKET AND BUSINESS STRATEGY

The Company invests in a diverse portfolio of real estate assets. The Company seeks three types of commercial real estate properties primarily located in the western United States for which the Company&#8217;s decision-makers internally evaluate operating performance and financial results: commercial office properties and industrial ( &#8220; Office/Industrial Properties &#8221;), retail properties (&#8220; Retail Properties &#8221;) and residential properties, including Model Homes (&#8220; Residential Properties &#8221;). 

Our investment objective is to create current income and growth for our stockholders to fund our continuing operations and to pay out monthly and quarterly cash distributions to our stockholders. Our primary strategy to achieve our objective is to invest in and own a diversified portfolio of income producing commercial real estate assets that will produce a stabilized cash flow with increase values over time. In the past, we have acquired commercial office, industrial, self-storage, retail, single family residential Model Homes, and multi-unit residential real estate with promising financial opportunities located primarily in the western United States. 

Investment &#8211; Commercial properties 

NetREIT&#8217;s Office/Industrial and Retail Properties are located primarily in Southern California and Colorado, with four properties located in North Dakota. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or had an equity interest in twenty Office/Industrial Properties which total approximately 1,614,000 rentable square feet and six Retail Properties which total approximately 236,000 rentable square feet. Our tenant list of the non-Model Home portfolio is highly diversified consisting of over 300 individual commercial tenants with an average remaining lease term of approximately five years. No single commercial tenant represents more than 5.0% of revenue, while the Company&#8217;s ten largest tenants represent approximately 23.2% of annualized base rent revenue. In addition, the rent rolls have limited exposure to any single industry. Our Office/Industrial and Retail Properties had a net book value of approximately $214.2 million as of December 31, 2015.

Investment - Model Home properties

Our Model Homes business is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, Inc., three limited partnerships, Dubose Model Home Investors #201, LP Dubose Model Home Investors #202, LP and NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, LP and one limited liability company NetREIT Model Homes, LLC. Our Model Home properties are located in ten states throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015, these entities owned 64 Model Homes with a net book value of approximately $16.9 million.

NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, Inc. (&#8220; NetREIT Dubose &#8221;) is engaged in the business of acquiring Model Homes from third party homebuilders in sale-leaseback transactions whereby a homebuilder sells the Model Home to NetREIT Dubose and leases back the Model Home under a triple net lease ( &#8220; NNN &#8221; ) for use in marketing its residential development. Our Model Home business was started in March 2010 through the acquisition of certain assets and rights from Dubose Model Homes USA (&#8220; DMHU &#8221; ), which we refer to as the ( &#8220; DMHU Purchase &#8221;). Subsequent to its formation, NetREIT Dubose raised $10.6 million pursuant to a private placement of its common stock (the private placement was terminated on December 31, 2013). As of December 31, 2015, NetREIT has invested $2.6 million in NetREIT Dubose through the purchase of common stock. We owned approximately 27.2% of NetREIT Dubose as of December 31, 2015.

We operate three limited partnerships in connection with NetREIT Dubose, Dubose Model Home Investors #201, LP (&#8220; DMHI #201 &#8221;), Dubose Model Home Investors #202, LP (&#8220; DMHI #202 &#8221;) and NetREIT Dubose Model Home REIT, LP (&#8220; NetREIT LP &#8221;). The limited partnerships typically raise private equity to invest in Model Home properties and lease them back to the homebuilders.

&#160;

&#183; 

We owned 8.3% of DMHI #201 LP as of December 31, 2015. DMHI #201 raised $3.0 million through the sale of partnership units. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We owned 10.3% of DMHI #202 as of December 31, 2015. The partnership had raised $2.9 million, including our investment, through December 31, 2015. This partnership was formed to raise up to $5.0 million through the sale of units. 

&#160;

&#183; 

NetREIT Dubose owned 100 % of NetREIT LP as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We owned 100% of NetREIT Model Homes, LLC as of December 31, 2015. 

We provide management services to our various limited partnerships through NetREIT Advisors, LLC ( &#8220; NetREIT Advisors &#8221; ) and Dubose Advisors LLC ( &#8220; Dubose Advisors &#8221; ). These entities are 100% owned subsidiaries and are referred to collectively as the (&#8220; Advisors &#8221;). For their services, each of the Advisors receives ongoing management fees, acquisition fees and has the right to receive certain other fees when a partnership sells or otherwise disposes of a Model Home. NetREIT Advisors manages NetREIT Dubose, NetREIT Model Homes, LLC and Dubose Advisors manages DMHI #201 and DMHI #202.

Use of Leverage

We use mortgage loans secured by the individual properties in order to maximize the return for our stockholders. Typically these loans would be for terms ranging from 5 to 10 years. Currently the majority of our mortgage loans are structured as non-recourse to us with the limited exceptions that would cause a recourse nature only upon occurrence of certain fraud, misconduct, environmental, or bankruptcy events. The non-recourse financing limits the exposure to the amount of equity invested in each property pledged as collateral thereby protecting the equity in the other assets. We can provide no assurance that the non-recourse financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all and there may be circumstances where lenders have recourse to our other assets. To a lesser extent, we use recourse financing or a cross collateral pledge of certain properties. At December 31, 2015, $9.1 million of our total debt was recourse to the Company and relates to the model homes properties.

We use both fixed and variable interest rate debt to finance our properties. Wherever possible, we prefer to obtain fixed rate mortgage financing as it provides better cost predictability. As of December 31, 2015, none of our mortgage obligations include variable interest rate provisions.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT 

The Company is the primary property manager for all of its properties. The Company retains third party property management companies in Colorado and North Dakota to render on-site management services.

COMPETITION

Our principal factors of competition is our focus on contrarian, immediate yield, value-driven acquisitions by seeking unique properties with identifiable value-creation opportunities without the need for significant structural improvements or other costly renovations. We operate in niche geographies, targeting $5-$25 million acquisitions of properties or small portfolios in order to limit competition from both larger and well capitalized buyers focused on core markets.

We compete with a number of other real estate investors, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. Competitors include other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships, and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of its investments. In addition, many of these entities have capital structures that allow them to make investments at higher prices than what we can prudently offer while still generating a return to their investors that is commensurate with the return we are seeking to provide our investors. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire. The concentration of our properties in Southern California, Colorado and North Dakota makes us especially susceptible to local market conditions in these areas. 

To be successful, we must be able to continue to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local and regional economic conditions by adjusting rental rates of our properties as appropriate. If we are unable to respond quickly and effectively, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay dividends may be adversely affected.

REGULATION

Our Management will continually review our investment activity in order to prevent us from coming within the application of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). Among other things, Management will attempt to monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments so that we do not come within the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Act. If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, would be required to comply with the operating restrictions of the 1940 Act which are generally inconsistent with our typical operations. As such, we will take the necessary action to ensure that we are not deemed to be an &#8220;investment company.&#8221;

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our properties. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint) and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. All proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we may be required to abandon otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a mater ial adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringe nt requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. 

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY

Our Management

We refer to our executive officers and any directors who are affiliated with them as our &#8220; Management &#8221;. &#160; Our Management is currently comprised of:

&#160;

&#183; 

Jack K. Heilbron, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of NetREIT, Inc., President and Director of NetREIT Dubose, and President of NetREIT Advisors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Kenneth W. Elsberry, Chief Financial Officer and Director of NetREIT, Inc., and CFO of Dubose Advisors and NetREIT Advisors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Larry G. Dubose, Director of NetREIT, Inc., CFO and Director of NetREIT Dubose, and CEO of Dubose and NetREIT Advisors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gary Katz, Senior Vice President-Asset Management; of NetREIT, Inc. 

Mr. Heilbron is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs. Mr. Dubose is responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of the Dubose and NetREIT Advisors and our Model Homes Division. Mr. Katz, is responsible for managing the day-to-day affairs for the Office/Industrial and Retail Properties. Mr. Heilbron, Mr. Elsberry, and Mr. Katz are responsible for all Company property acquisitions.

Our Board of Directors

Our Management is subject to the direction and supervision of our board of directors (our &#8220;Board&#8221; ). Among other things, our Board must approve each real property acquisition our Management proposes. There are eight directors comprising our Board, five of whom are independent directors, as defined by the New York and NASDQ Stock Exchanges ( &#8220;Independent Directors&#8221; ). Three of our directors, Mr. Heilbron, Mr. Elsberry, and Mr. Dubose are not independent directors. 

TAX STATUS

Starting in our 2000 tax year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), to maintain our status as a REIT and receive favorable REIT income tax treatment, we must comply with certain requirements of federal income tax laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to continuous change and reinterpretation. We have received an opinion of special tax counsel that we will qualify as a REIT if we achieve certain of our objectives, including diversity of stock ownership and operating standards. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve these goals and thus qualify or continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. The principal tax consequences of our being taxed as a REIT are that our stockholders may receive dividends that are indirectly sheltered from corporate federal income taxation. In the event we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to taxation on two levels because our income will be taxed at the corporate level and we will not be able to deduct the dividends we pay to our stockholders. In turn, stockholders will be taxed on dividends they receive from us.

To continue to be taxed as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, as defined in the Code and calculated on an annual basis. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year, our income will be taxed at regular corporate rates and stockholders will be taxed on dividends they receive from us, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify. Even though we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.

OFFICES AND EMPLOYEES 

Our offices are situated in approximately 12,134 square feet of space in Escondido, California.

As of March 18, 2016, we have a total of 23 full-time and 1 part-time employees.
