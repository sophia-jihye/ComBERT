 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Business Development 

&#160; 

Concierge Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Concierge&#8221; or sometimes the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated in California on August 18, 1993 as "Fanfest, Inc." On August 29, 1995 its name was changed to Starfest, Inc. (&#8220;Starfest&#8221;), and on March 20, 2002 its name was changed to &#8220;Concierge Technologies, Inc.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "MAS XX Purchase Agreement") dated March 6, 2000 between MAS Capital, Inc., an Indiana corporation, the controlling shareholder of MAS Acquisition XX Corp. ("MAS XX"), an Indiana corporation, and Starfest, approximately 96.83 percent (8,250,000 shares) of the outstanding shares of common stock of MAS XX were exchanged for $100,000 and 150,000 shares of common stock of Starfest in a transaction in which Starfest became the parent corporation of MAS XX. 

&#160; 

At the time of this transaction, the market price of Starfest's common stock was $1.50 bid at closing on March 7, 2000 on the OTC Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTCBB&#8221;). Accordingly, the consideration Starfest paid for the 96.83 percent interest in MAS XX was valued at $325,000. Concierge, Inc., a Nevada corporation, loaned Starfest the $100,000 cash portion of the consideration evidenced by a no-interest, demand note. Michael Huemmer, the president of Starfest, loaned to Starfest the 150,000 shares of common stock of Starfest that was the stock portion of the consideration. 

&#160; 

Upon execution of the MAS XX Purchase Agreement and the subsequent delivery of $100,000 cash and 150,000 shares of Starfest common stock on March 7, 2000, to MAS Capital Inc., pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;Commission&#8221;), Starfest became the successor issuer to MAS XX for reporting purposes under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) and elected to report under the Act effective March 7, 2000. 

&#160; 

MAS XX had no business, no assets, and no liabilities at the time of the transaction. Starfest entered into the transaction solely for the purpose of becoming the successor issuer to MAS XX for reporting purposes under the 1934 Exchange Act. Prior to this transaction, Starfest was preparing to register its common stock with the Commission in order to avoid being delisted by the OTCBB. By engaging in the Rule 12g-3(a) transaction, Starfest avoided the possibility that its planned registration statement with the Commission would not be fully reviewed by the Commission's staff before an April 2000 deadline, which would result in Starfest's common stock being delisted on the OTCBB. 

&#160; 

An agreement of merger was entered into between Starfest and Concierge, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on January 26, 2000. The proposed merger was submitted to the shareholders of each of Starfest and Concierge, Inc., pursuant to a Form S-4 Prospectus-Proxy Statement filed with the Commission. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As described in Starfest&#8217;s Form 8-K filed on April 2, 2002, with the Commission (Commission File No. 000-29913), the shareholders of Starfest and Concierge did approve the merger, and the merger was legally effected on March 20, 2002. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the agreement of merger between Starfest and Concierge, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Starfest was the surviving corporation, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The shareholders of Concierge received pro rata for their shares of common stock of Concierge, 99,957,713 shares of common stock of Starfest in the merger, and all shares of capital stock of Concierge were cancelled, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The fiscal year-end of the corporation was changed to June 30, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The officers and directors of Concierge became the officers and directors of Starfest, and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The name of Starfest was changed to "Concierge Technologies, Inc." 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Concierge conducts business primarily through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. The operations of Concierge&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries are more particularly described herein but are summarized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Kahnalytics, Inc., a US based company, captures and presents data from vehicle-mounted camera devices equipped for live-streaming. 

&#9679; 

Gourmet Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand based company, manufactures and distributes New Zealand meat pies on a commercial scale. 

&#9679; 

Brigadier Security Systems, a Canadian based company, sells and installs commercial and residential alarm monitoring systems. These activities are conducted in the US, New Zealand and Canada respectively. 

&#160; 

On May 5, 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding and issued shares of Planet Halo, a privately held Nevada corporation. 

&#160; 

On June 5, 2007 Planet Halo launched its first wireless broadband network designed for subscription access to the Internet. The second such network was completed in Ventura, California during the 2007-2008 fiscal year. Planet Halo continued to operate and expand the subscriber base until encountering insurmountable competition from disruptive technologies. The wireless business was discontinued during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, and a transition was made to research and development activities for in-vehicle video recording devices. In January 2013 we sold all of our interest in Planet Halo through a stock redemption agreement wherein a holder of Concierge Series B, Voting, Convertible Preferred stock exchanged a portion of those shares for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Planet Halo. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On January 23, 2008 we acquired all of the outstanding and issued shares of Wireless Village, a privately held Nevada corporation based in Cleveland, Ohio. Wireless Village&#8217;s assets included computer hardware, software, domain names, existing radio site infrastructure, and expertise in designing, operating, managing and maintaining wireless and wired networks, including video security systems. Wireless Village began transitioning to the business of mobile incident reporting, or &#8220;black box&#8221; technology, for vehicles during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. During September 2010 Wireless Village offered three knowledgeable individuals, a product manufacturer, and an industry lobbyist an equity stake in the company in exchange for providing their services and expertise, along with a potential client list, exclusively to Wireless Village. Accordingly, on October 8, 2010, we conveyed approximately 49% of Concierge&#8217;s equity in Wireless Village, in the aggregate, to the aforementioned group. As a result the focus of Wireless Village was redirected to the business of mobile incident reporting technology and sales. A fictitious business name of 3 rd Eye Cam was adopted and filed in the State of Nevada and, subsequent to a trade mark dispute settlement, that name was discontinued in favor of the fictitious name Janus Cam. The company then operated from leased offices in South San Francisco, CA. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Concierge, through a stock exchange agreement, acquired all of the shares owned by the minority shareholders of Wireless Village in exchange for shares of Concierge Series B, Voting, Convertible Preferred stock. As of June 30, 2014, Wireless Village was a wholly owned subsidiary of Concierge and its only operating subsidiary. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we entered into a Stock Redemption Agreement (the &#8220;SRA&#8221;) wherein we agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding shares in Wireless Village to the executive management team of Wireless Village in exchange for the redemption of 68,000,000 shares of Concierge&#8217;s common stock held by the buyers plus a forgiveness of intercompany debt totaling $344,052 owed to us by Wireless Village. As a further condition of the SRA a certain segment of the Wireless Village business was to be retained by Concierge through a non-exclusive distribution agreement. The transaction closed on May 7, 2015. 

&#160; 

On May 26, 2015, a new wholly-owned subsidiary named Kahnalytics, Inc. (&#8220;Kahnalytics&#8221;), was established in the State of California for the purpose of taking on the segment of the business retained in the spinoff of Janus Cam and to direct resources towards the further development of data processing capabilities intended for risk management used by vehicle insurance companies. 

&#160; 

On August 11, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock in Gourmet Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand corporation (&#8220;Gourmet Foods&#8221;) located in Tauranga, who is a commercial-scale manufacturer of New Zealand meat pies under the brand names &#8220;Ponsonby Pies&#8221; and &#8220;Pat&#8217;s Pantry&#8221;. Gourmet Foods distributes its products through major grocery store chains, convenience stores, small restaurants and gasoline station markets. The purchase price of $1,753,428 was paid in cash. 

&#160; 

On June 2, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock in Brigadier Security Systems, a Canadian corporation (&#8220;Brigadier&#8221;) located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Brigadier sells and installs alarm monitoring and security systems to commercial and residential customers under brand names &#8220;Brigadier Security Systems&#8221; and &#8220;Elite Security&#8221; throughout the province of Saskatchewan with offices in Saskatoon and Regina. The all-cash purchase price was $1,540,830. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition. Our potential competitors include larger, better financed companies that offer products similar to ours. In particular, our foreign subsidiaries face stiff competition with respect to their product and service offerings. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors&#8217; products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any products we may commercialize and may render our products obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their commercialization. Our larger competitors also enjoy a much wider and entrenched market share making it particularly difficult for us to penetrate certain market segments and even if penetrated, might make it difficult to maintain. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products and new competitors enter the market. However, with respect to the market share we currently enjoy, we believe that our core customers will remain loyal. We will continue to strive to capture additional customers through organic growth and a focus on quality. &#160; 

Governmental Approval of Principal Products . No governmental approval is required in the U.S. for Concierge's products. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations . There are no governmental regulations in the U.S. that apply to Concierge's sale of subscriptions to its Kahnalytics live-streaming data services, and no specific license or approvals are required, with the exception of adoption by local industry associations or municipalities on a case-by-case basis of the devices meeting suitability for purpose standards. 

&#160; 

Dependence on Major Customers and Suppliers . Concierge, through Kahnalytics as a licensed user of a proprietary software application, is dependent on the continued support of this online platform and the adherence to the license contract terms between Kahnalytics and the foreign-based licensor. Kahnalytics is also largely dependent on its single-source sales channel to continue to expand its dealer network of resellers who, in turn, activate subscribers to the Kahnalytics service. Hardware sold by Kahnalytics is currently supplied by one source, however in the event this source proves to be inadequate there are other alternative sources of equal or comparable devices as needed by Kahnalytics. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 Kahnalytics had just one customer accounting for 100% of its sales. Correspondingly, Kahnalytics had only two suppliers of the hardware it sold with the larger of the suppliers accounting for 92% of the cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Sales of these products were discontinued during the current fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Concierge, through Brigadier Security Systems, is dependent upon its contractual relationship with the alarm monitoring company who purchases the monitoring contracts and provides monitoring services to Brigadier&#8217;s customers. In the event this contract is terminated Brigadier would be compelled to find an alternate source of alarm monitoring, or establish such a facility itself. Management believes that the contractual relationship is sustainable, and has been for many years, with alternate solutions available should the need arise. Sales to the two largest customers totaled 55% of the total revenues for the one-month period ended June 30, 2016, and accounted for approximately 38.6% of accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date of June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Concierge, through Gourmet Foods, has three major customer groups comprising the gross revenues to Gourmet Foods; 1) grocery, 2) gasoline convenience stores, 3) independent retailers. The grocery and food industry is dominated by several large chain operations, which are customers of Gourmet Foods, and there are no long term guarantees that these major customers will continue to purchase products from Gourmet Foods, however the relationships have been in place for sufficient time to give management reasonable confidence in their continuing business. For the 11-month period ending and balance sheet date of June 30, 2016, our largest customer in the grocery industry, who operates through a number independently branded stores, accounted for approximately 14% of our gross sales revenues and 34% of our accounts receivable. The second largest in the grocery industry accounted for approximately 10% of our gross revenues and 12% of our accounts receivable. In the gasoline convenience store market we supply two major accounts. The largest is a marketing consortium of gasoline dealers accounting for approximately 44% of our gross sales revenues and 24% of our accounts receivable. The second largest are independent operators accounting for approximately 13% of gross sales and 17% of accounts receivable. The third category of independent retailers accounted for the balance of our gross sales revenue however the group is fragmented and no one customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Gourmet Foods is not dependent upon any one major supplier as many alternative sources are available in the local market place should the need arise. 

&#160; 

Seasonality . There should be no seasonal aspect to Concierge&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Research and Development . Concierge expended no significant amount of money on research and development during fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Environmental Controls . Concierge is subject to no environmental controls or restrictions that require the outlay of capital or the obtaining of a permit in order to engage in business in the US. In New Zealand, Gourmet Foods is subject to local regulations as are usual and customary for those in the food processing, manufacturing and distribution business. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Intellectual Property . Concierge has trademarked its Personal Communications Attendant. It has no patents on the product. Gourmet Foods, Ponsonby Pies and Pat&#8217;s Pantry are all registered trademarks of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. 

&#160; 

Number of Employees . On June 30, 2016, we employed no persons full time and relied solely on independent sales personnel, commissioned agents, contracted service providers and consultants to perform additional support and administrative functions in the US. Gourmet Foods employs approximately 45 persons in New Zealand and Brigadier employs approximately 19 persons in Canada.
