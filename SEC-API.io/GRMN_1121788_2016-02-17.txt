Company Overview 

&#160; 

For over 25 years, Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) has pioneered new Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and wireless devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. Garmin serves five primary business units, including auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a diverse family of hand-held, wearable, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications, sensor-based and information products. Since the inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 157 million products, which includes the delivery of more than 16 million products during 2015.

&#160; 

Overview of the Global Positioning System 

&#160; 

The Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology. The system consists of numerous constellations of orbiting satellites. Access to the systems is provided free of charge.

&#160;

Garmin utilizes a variety of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) including, but not limited to:

&#183; The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage. &#183; Japan&#8217;s MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) which achieved initial operating capability for enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation on September 27, 2007. &#183; The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) aviation Safety of Life (SoL) service which achieved initial operating capability for enroute, terminal, and approach navigation on March 2, 2011. &#183; The Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), a space-based satellite navigation system operated by the Russian Federation, consisting of 24 satellites and providing world-wide coverage. In certain urban canyon or restricted sky visibility situations, the use of both GPS and GLONASS satellites to produce a navigation fix may result in improved accuracy. &#160; 

The accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (&#8220;FAA&#8221;) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States and most of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications.

Garmin&#8217;s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin&#8217;s engineering and manufacturing teams. Garmin&#8217;s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 3,412 people worldwide as of December 26, 2015. Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin&#8217;s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin&#8217;s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin&#8217;s success. Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.

&#160;

Below is a table of Garmin&#8217;s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 26, &#160; &#160; December 27, &#160; &#160; December 28, &#160; ($'s in thousands) &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Research and development &#160; &#160; 427,043 &#160; &#160; &#160; 395,121 &#160; &#160; &#160; 364,923 &#160; Percent of net sales &#160; &#160; 15.1 % &#160; &#160; 13.8 % &#160; &#160; 13.9 % &#160; 

Manufacturing and Operations 

&#160;

Garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.

&#160;

Specifically, Garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality and time to market.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Cost: Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency, resulting in lower cost. Garmin&#8217;s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high, mid and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects Garmin&#8217;s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products. The ownership and integration of our resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products, yielding improved cost.

&#160;

Quality: Garmin&#8217;s automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.

&#160;

Time to Market: Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.

&#160;

Garmin&#8217;s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin&#8217;s automotive operations in Taiwan and Olathe have achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin&#8217;s new China facility in Yangzhou has received a TS16949 letter of conformance and expects to be formally certified in fourth quarter 2016. Garmin&#8217;s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry. 

&#160;

Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd. and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin&#8217;s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance.

&#160;

Materials 

&#160; 

Although most components essential to Garmin&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.

&#160;

Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components. Nevertheless, if Garmin&#8217;s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin&#8217;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Garmin&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin&#8217;s requirements.

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the Mother&#8217;s Day/Father&#8217;s Day/graduation buying season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160;

Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business. For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.

&#160;

As of January 7, 2016, Garmin&#8217;s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 950 patent and 640 trademark registrations issued worldwide. Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law. For the past eight years Garmin has been selected as a constituent of the Ocean Tomo&#174; 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin&#8217;s rights in its proprietary technologies.

&#160;

There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

&#160; 

Regulations 

&#160; 

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with the United States&#8217; Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin&#8217;s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin&#8217;s products, or losing certification for Garmin&#8217;s existing products could adversely affect our business. In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in &#8220;type certificated aircraft&#8221; are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company&#8217;s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin&#8217;s operations. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Garmin&#8217;s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes. Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget.

&#160;

Environmental regulation of Garmin&#8217;s products is increasing. Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency. Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

&#160;

Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management. Garmin&#8217;s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin&#8217;s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin&#8217;s European headquarters facility, and Garmin&#8217;s Taiwan manufacturing facility.

&#160;

Regulatory and &#8220;Green Procurement&#8221; demands from our customers are also increasing; particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives. The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established. Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 26, 2015, Garmin had 11,651 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 4,333 were in the United States, 88 were in Canada, 5,289 were in Taiwan, 1,294 were in Europe, and 647 were in other global locations. Except for some of Garmin&#8217;s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin&#8217;s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
