 Item 1. Business

&#160;

We are a blank check company incorporated on January 28, 2015 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our Sponsor and management team to identify and complete a business combination with one or more businesses in the asset management industry, although we may pursue business combination opportunities in other industries. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prohibit us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.

&#160;

The registration statement for the Company&#8217;s initial public offering (&#8220;Initial Public Offering&#8221;) was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on May 19, 2015. On May 26, 2015, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 units (the &#8220;Public Units&#8221;), with each Public Unit consisting of one ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share (the &#8220;Public Shares&#8221;), and one-half of one warrant (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;). The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $172,500,000.

&#160;

Prior to the consummation of our initial public offering, on March 2, 2015, our Sponsor purchased 4,312,500 ordinary shares (the &#8220;Founder Shares&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. The Founder Shares are identical to the ordinary shares included in the Public Units except that the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below.

&#160;

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 6,062,500 warrants (the &#8220;Private Placement Warrants&#8221;) at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement to the Company&#8217;s Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6,062,500. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount of $172,500,000 ($10.00 per share) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Company acting as trustee (&#8220;Trust Account&#8221;) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. As of December 31, 2015, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Effecting our Initial Business Combination

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Other than searching for and evaluating potential target companies, we are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effect our initial business combination using cash from proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.

&#160;

If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

&#160;

Selecting a Target Business and Structuring our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, advisory fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.

&#160;

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination in our proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable.

&#160;

To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which will include, as applicable, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.

&#160;

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. In no event, however, will our Sponsor, our officers or directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the closing of an initial business combination other than the reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses or the repayment of loans that we may receive from time to time to fund our working capital needs.

&#160;

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination

&#160;

We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares included in the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per Public Share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our Warrants. Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may acquire during or after our Initial Public Offering in connection with the completion of our business combination.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Manner of Conducting Redemptions

&#160;

We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval by law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination.

&#160;

If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

&#160;

&#183; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), which regulate issuer tender offers, and &#160;

&#183; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. &#160;

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

&#160;

If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:

&#160;

&#183; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and &#160;

&#183; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160;

In the event that we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after our Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, provided that a public shareholder must in fact vote for or against a proposed business combination in order to have his, her or its ordinary shares redeemed. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.

&#160;

We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either (a) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (b) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically, in each case prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public shareholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates delivered, or shares tendered electronically, by public shareholders who elected to redeem their shares.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

&#160;

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&#8217; ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering) for or against our initial business combination.

&#160;

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination

&#160;

Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders&#8217; rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. However, if our initial shareholders acquire Public Shares after our Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time frame. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our assets to our public shareholders.

&#160;

The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering.

&#160;

Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares upon approval of such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules).

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

We currently have two executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the closing of an initial business combination.

&#160;

Available Information

&#160;

We are required to file Annual Reports on form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g. changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Form on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy the materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statement and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC&#8217;s internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
