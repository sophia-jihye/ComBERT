 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Overview

Culp, Inc. manufacturers, sources, and markets mattress fabrics and sewn covers for mattresses, foundations and other bedding products; and upholstery fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily used in the production of upholstered furniture. The company competes in a fashion-driven business, and we strive to differentiate ourselves by placing sustained focus on product innovation and creativity along with excellent and dependable service to our customers. Our focused efforts to protect our financial strength have allowed us to maintain our position as a financially stable and trusted supplier of innovative fabrics to bedding and furniture manufacturers.

We believe Culp is the largest producer of mattress fabrics in North America and one of the largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture in North America, measured by total sales. We have two operating segments &#8212; mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. The mattress fabrics business markets primarily knitted and woven fabrics, and sewn covers made from those fabrics, which are used in the production of bedding products, including mattresses, foundations, and mattress sets. The upholstery fabrics business markets a variety of fabric products that are used principally in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture, including sofas, recliners, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, sofa-beds and office seating.

Culp markets a variety of fabrics in different categories to a global customer base, including fabrics produced at our manufacturing facilities and fabrics produced by other suppliers. We had thirteen active manufacturing plants and distribution facilities as of the end of fiscal 2016, located in North and South Carolina; Quebec, Canada; and Shanghai, China. We also source fabrics from other manufacturers, located primarily in China and Turkey, with almost all of those fabrics produced specifically for Culp and created by Culp designers. We operate distribution centers in North Carolina and Shanghai, China, to facilitate distribution of our products. Over the past decade, the portion of total company sales represented by fabrics produced outside of the U.S. and Canada has increased, while sales of goods produced in the U.S. have decreased. This trend is due primarily to the upholstery fabrics segment, where 91% of our sales now consist of fabrics produced in Asia.

Total net sales in fiscal 2016 were $312.9 million. The mattress fabrics segment had net sales of $186.4 million (60% of total net sales), while the upholstery fabrics segment had net sales of $126.4 million (40% of total net sales).

During fiscal 2016, both segments continued to build upon strategic initiatives and structural changes that were implemented over the last several years. The flexible manufacturing and sourcing platform created through these changes has allowed Culp to place a greater emphasis on product innovation and the introduction of new designs to keep current with industry trends and differentiate our products. This approach has helped us drive continued sales growth, with fiscal 2016 representing our seventh consecutive year of higher net sales.

&#160;

Industry strength and demand for our products has improved during the past several years, with a stronger recovery in the bedding industry than in the upholstered furniture business. During the same period, we have experienced positive responses from customers to our innovative designs and new product introductions during these years, with improved profitability. Sales and operating income in mattress fabrics increased 4% and 22%, respectively, during fiscal 2016. Net sales for upholstery fabrics were slightly lower in fiscal 2016. but our operating income showed significant improvement due to a more profitable product mix. Both business segments experienced lower raw material costs and lower operating expenses due to more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. An increasing percentage of our sales are now based on new product introductions. For the company as a whole, pre-tax income for fiscal 2016 was $27.9 million, the highest level in company history, exceeding the record level of the previous year.

The mattress fabrics segment has made strategic investments in capital projects and expansion initiatives in recent years. Investments have been targeted at expanding capacity, continuing improvements in service capabilities, maintaining a flexible approach to fabric sourcing, and dealing with challenging industry conditions. The mattress fabrics segment has also expanded its design capabilities with additional personnel and product software to enhance innovation. During fiscal 2013, this segment announced a joint marketing agreement to market sewn mattress covers, which involved the establishment of a new production facility. In fiscal 2014, we completed an asset purchase and related consulting agreement that provided for, among other things, the purchase of equipment and certain other assets and the restructuring of prior consulting and non-compete agreements. These initiatives have allowed for further expansion of our mattress fabrics business.

Our upholstery fabrics segment underwent major changes over the past decade, transforming from a primarily U.S.-based manufacturing operation with large amounts of fixed assets, to a more flexible variable cost model, with most fabrics sourced in Asia. At the same time, we have maintained control over the key components of fabric production such as design, finishing, quality control, and distribution. These changes involved a multi-year restructuring process that ended in fiscal 2009, during which time our upholstery fabric sales declined considerably. This multi-year trend of declining upholstery revenues and profits has reversed, with sales and income for this segment well above the levels reached during the Great Recession, and pre-tax income establishing a new record in fiscal 2016. Since the end of our multi-year restructuring, we have focused on product innovation and marketing, including the exploration of new markets.

Mattress Fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment, also known as Culp Home Fashions, manufactures and markets mattress fabric and mattress covers to bedding manufacturers. These products include woven jacquard fabrics, knitted fabrics, and some converted fabrics. Culp Home Fashions has manufacturing facilities located in Stokesdale and High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada. One Stokesdale plant and the St. Jerome plant both manufacture and finish jacquard (damask) fabric. The main Stokesdale plant also finishes knitted fabric and houses the division offices and finished goods distribution capabilities, while the High Point and St. Jerome facilities house our knitted mattress fabrics manufacturing operations. During fiscal 2013, the mattress fabrics division established a second plant in Stokesdale to produce cut and sewn mattress covers, a growing product category that is used primarily by producers of specialty (non-innerspring) bedding. We have also maintained flexibility in our supply of the major categories of mattress fabrics and some sewn covers, with sourcing capacity located in Turkey and China. Most of our woven jacquard and knitted fabrics can be produced in multiple facilities (internal or external to the company), providing us with mirrored, reactive capacity involving state of the art capabilities across plant facilities.

Culp Home Fashions had capital expenditures during the past ten years totaling approximately $56 million, which primarily provided for increased knit machine capacity, faster and more efficient weaving machines, and the initial capital required for our sewn cover business. These capital expenditures also provided high technology finishing equipment for woven and knitted fabric and an improved platform for warehousing and distribution. In order to maintain our leading edge technology and support modernization and expansion projects, we significantly increased our capital investments in the mattress fabrics segment during fiscal 2015 and 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

Asset acquisition transactions in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2014 allowed us to enhance and secure our competitive position and to increase our mattress fabrics business. Taken together, the two transactions allowed us to secure our supply for knitted mattress fabrics, an important and growing product category, while also gaining control of product development and enhancing customer service. The transactions also involved consulting and non-compete agreements that enhanced our mattress fabrics product development and helped to secure our end markets. In addition to these transactions, we have continued to make further investments in knitting machines and finishing equipment, increasing our internal production capacity substantially.

Our sewn mattress cover business, established during fiscal 2013, participates in a joint marketing agreement for the production and marketing of sewn mattress covers and represents a further step in our efforts to respond to industry demands. The marketing venture is known as Culp-Lava Applied Sewn Solutions (CLASS), and is a joint marketing effort with A. Lava &#38; Son Co. of Chicago, a leading provider of mattress covers. This manufacturing operation, located near our other plants in North Carolina, involves leased space and a limited capital investment in equipment. Teaming with A. Lava &#38; Son allows us to have two mirrored manufacturing facilities and great flexibility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers.

Upholstery Fabrics. The upholstery fabrics segment markets fabrics for residential and commercial furniture, including jacquard woven fabrics, velvets, microdenier suedes, woven dobbies, knitted fabrics, piece-dyed woven products, and polyurethane &#8220;leather look&#8221; fabrics. This segment operates fabric manufacturing facilities in Anderson, South Carolina, and Shanghai, China. We market fabrics produced in these two locations, as well as a variety of upholstery fabrics sourced from third party producers, mostly in China. In the past fiscal year, sales of non-U.S. produced upholstery accounted for approximately 91% of our upholstery fabric sales. Our China facilities near Shanghai include fabric sourcing, finishing, warehousing, quality control and inspection operations, as well as a plant where sourced fabrics are cut and sewn into &#8220;kits&#8221; made to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers. Important recent developments in our China operations include expansion of our product development and design capabilities in China and further strengthening of key strategic partnerships with mills. We also have expanded our marketing efforts to sell our China products in countries other than the U.S., including the Chinese local market. The U.S. facility in South Carolina produces a variety of woven upholstery fabrics, including velvets and certain decorative fabrics.

During fiscal 2015 we closed our distribution warehouse in Poland that had been established to support sales in Europe. We are currently reviewing the company&#8217;s best long-term strategy for marketing upholstery fabrics in Europe.

Our upholstery fabrics business has moved from one that relied on a large fixed capital base that was difficult to adjust to a more flexible and scalable marketer of upholstery fabrics that meets changing levels of customer demand and style preferences. At the same time, we have maintained control of the most important &#8220;value-added&#8221; aspects of our business, such as design, finishing, quality control, and logistics. This strategic approach has allowed us to limit our investment of capital in fixed assets and control the costs of our products, while continuing to leverage our design and finishing expertise, industry knowledge, and important relationships.

Our upholstery fabrics sales decreased slightly in fiscal 2016 after six consecutive years of growth, while operating income for this segment increased strongly during the year. We believe the positive trends in sales and profits for the upholstery fabrics segment are due primarily to implementation of a business strategy that has included: 1) innovation in a low-cost environment, 2) speed-to-market execution, 3) consistent quality, 4) reliable service and lead times, and 5) increased recognition of and reliance on the Culp brand. Success in upholstery fabrics has been achieved through development of a unique business model that has enabled the upholstery segment to execute a strategy that we believe is clearly differentiated from our competitors. In this way, we have maintained our ability to provide furniture manufacturers with products from every category of fabric used to cover upholstered furniture, and to meet continually changing demand levels and consumer preferences.

&#160;

Overview of Industry and Markets

&#160;

Culp markets products primarily to manufacturers that operate in three principal markets. The mattress fabrics segment supplies the bedding industry, which produces mattress sets (mattresses, box springs, foundations and top of bed components). The upholstery fabrics segment supplies the residential furniture industry and, to a lesser extent, the commercial furniture industry. The residential furniture market includes upholstered furniture sold to consumers for household use, including sofas, sofa-beds, chairs, recliners, and sectionals. The commercial furniture and fabrics market includes upholstered office seating and modular office systems sold primarily for use in offices and other institutional settings, fabrics used in the hospitality industry, and commercial textile wall coverings. The principal industries into which the company sells products are described below. Currently the vast majority of our products are sold to manufacturers for end use in the U.S., and thus the discussions below are focused on that market.

Overview of Bedding Industry

The bedding industry has contracted and expanded in recent years in accordance with the general economy, although traditionally the industry has been relatively mature and stable. This is due in part to the fact that a majority of bedding industry sales are replacement purchases, which are less volatile than sales based on economic growth and new household formations. Unlike the residential furniture industry, which continues to face intense competition from imports, the U.S. bedding industry has largely remained a North American-based business with limited competition from imports. Imports of bedding into the U.S. have increased in recent years, but imported beds still represent only a small fraction of total U.S. bedding sales. The primary reasons for this fact include: 1) the short lead times demanded by mattress manufacturers and retailers due to their quick service delivery model, 2) the limited inventory carried by manufacturers and retailers requires &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; delivery of product, 3) the customized nature of each manufacturer&#8217;s and retailer&#8217;s product lines, 4) high shipping and import duty costs, 5) the relatively low direct labor content in mattresses, and 6) strong brand recognition and importance.

A key trend driving the bedding industry is increased awareness among consumers about the health benefits of better sleep, which has caused an increased focus on the quality of bedding products and an apparent willingness on the part of consumers to upgrade their bedding. Another important trend is the strong and growing emphasis on the design knitted or woven into mattress fabrics to appeal to the customer&#8217;s visual attraction and perceived value of the mattress on the retail floor. Mattress fabric design efforts are based on current trends in home decor and fashion. Another trend has been the growth in non-traditional sources for retail mattress sales such as internet sales and wholesale warehouse clubs. These sales channels have the potential to increase overall consumption of goods due to convenience and high traffic volume, which in turn results in higher turnover of product. Among fabric types, knitted fabrics have continued to increase in popularity. Knitted fabric was initially used primarily on premium mattresses, but these products are now being placed increasingly on mattresses at mid-range to lower retail price points.

&#160;

Overview of Residential and Commercial Furniture Industry

Sales of residential and commercial furniture were both severely affected by the global economic downturn in 2008-2009, and have now been in recovery for several years along with the overall economy. The pace of recovery since 2010 has been relatively steady, but modest, as has the growth rate for the economy as a whole. Sales of residential furniture are influenced significantly by the housing industry and by trends in home sales and household formations, while demand for commercial furniture generally reflects economic trends affecting businesses.

The sourcing of components and fully assembled furniture from overseas continues to play a major role in the furniture industry. By far, the largest source for these imports continues to be China. Imports of upholstery fabric, both in roll and in &#8220;kit&#8221; form, have also had a significant impact on the market for upholstery fabrics in recent years. Fabrics entering the U.S. from China and other low labor cost countries have resulted in increased price competition in the upholstery fabric and upholstered furniture markets. Prices for leather have created increased opportunities for suppliers of &#8220;leather look&#8221; and suede fabrics, and for suppliers of upholstery generally.

In general, the residential furniture industry has been consolidating for several years. The result of this trend is fewer, but larger, customers for marketers of upholstery fabrics. Intense price competition continues to be an important consideration for both residential and commercial furniture.

Products

As described above, our products include mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, which are our identified operating segments. These fabrics are sold in roll form and as sewn mattress covers by the mattress fabrics segment, and in roll form and as cut and sewn kits by the upholstery fabrics segment.

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Mattress fabrics segment sales constituted 56% to 60% of our total net sales in each of the past three fiscal years. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at prices generally ranging from $1.50 to more than $10.00 per yard.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Upholstery fabrics segment sales totaled 40% to 44% of our sales for each of the past three fiscal years. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;better&#8221; prices, generally ranging from $3.00 to $10.00 per yard.

&#160;

Culp Product Categories by Segment 

&#160;

We market products in most categories of fabric that manufacturers currently use for bedding and furniture. The following table indicates the product lines within each segment, and a brief description of their characteristics.

Mattress Fabrics 

&#160;

Woven jacquards Various patterns and intricate designs. Woven on complex looms using a variety of synthetic and natural yarns. 

&#160;

Converted Suedes, pile and embroidered fabrics, and other specialty type products are sourced to offer diversity for higher end mattresses. 

&#160;

Knitted fabric Various patterns and intricate designs produced on special-width circular knit machines utilizing a variety of synthetic and natural yarns. Knitted mattress fabrics have inherent stretching properties and spongy softness, which conforms well with layered foam packages. 

&#160;

Sewn mattress covers Covers for bedding (primarily non-inner spring), sewn from knitted, jacquard and other mattress fabrics produced by our facilities or sourced from others. 

&#160;

Upholstery Fabrics 

&#160;

Woven jacquards Elaborate, complex designs such as florals and tapestries in traditional, transitional, and contemporary styles. Woven on intricate looms using a wide variety of synthetic and natural yarns. 

&#160;

Woven dobbies Fabrics that use straight lines to produce geometric designs such as plaids, stripes, and solids in traditional and country styles. Woven on less complicated looms using a variety of weaving constructions and primarily synthetic yarns. 

&#160;

Velvets Soft fabrics with a plush feel. Woven or knitted in basic designs, using synthetic yarns which are yarn dyed or piece dyed. 

&#160;

Suedes Fabrics woven or knitted using microdenier polyester yarns, which are piece dyed and finished, usually by sanding. The fabrics are typically plain or small jacquard designs, with some being printed. These are sometimes referred to as microdenier suedes. 

&#160;

Faux leathers Sueded or knitted base cloths which are overprinted with polyurethane, and composite products consisting of a base fabric which is coated with a top layer of polyurethane, which simulate the look and feel of leather. 

&#160;

Cut and sewn kits Covers made from various types of upholstery fabrics and cut and sewn to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers for use on specific furniture frames. 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing and Sourcing

&#160;

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Our mattress fabrics segment operates four manufacturing plants, with two located in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and one each in High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada. Over the past ten fiscal years, we made capital expenditures of approximately $56 million to consolidate all of our production of woven jacquards, or damask fabric, to these plants and to modernize both knit and weaving equipment, enhance and provide knit and woven finishing capabilities, and expand capacity in each of these facilities. The result has been an increase in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating costs, as well as expanded product offerings.

Jacquard mattress fabrics and knitted fabrics are produced at the St. Jerome plant, with further jacquard capacity at our main Stokesdale facility and knitting capacity at our High Point facility. Most finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the main Stokesdale plant. We have a joint marketing arrangement with a producer of sewn mattress covers for bedding. This arrangement includes an additional manufacturing facility in Stokesdale to produce and market sewn mattress covers.

In addition to the mattress fabrics we manufacture, we have important supply arrangements in place that allow us to source mattress fabric from strategic suppliers. A portion of our woven jacquard fabric and knitted fabric is obtained from a supplier located in Turkey, based on designs and a production schedule created by Culp. We are also sourcing some Culp-designed knitted fabrics using our Culp China platform, and we are also sourcing certain converted fabric products (such as suedes, pile fabrics and embroidered fabrics) through our China platform.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

We currently operate one upholstery manufacturing facility in the U.S. and three in China. The U.S. plant is located in Anderson, South Carolina, and mainly produces velvet upholstery fabrics with some production of certain decorative fabrics.

Our upholstery manufacturing facilities in China are all located within the same industrial area near Shanghai. At these facilities, we apply value-added finishing processes to fabrics sourced from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we inspect sourced fabric there as well. In addition, the Shanghai operations include facilities where sourced fabric is cut and sewn to provide &#8220;kits&#8221; that are designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by our customers.

A large portion of our upholstery fabric products, as well as certain elements of our production processes, are being sourced from outside suppliers. Our facilities in China provide a base from which to access a variety of products, including certain fabrics (such as microdenier suedes and polyurethane fabrics) that are not produced anywhere within the U.S. We have found opportunities to develop significant relationships with key overseas suppliers in China that allow us to source products on a cost-effective basis, while limiting our investment of capital in manufacturing assets. We source unfinished and finished fabrics, as well as a portion of our cut and sewn kits, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China who are willing to commit significant capacity to meet our needs while working with our product development team to meet the demands of our customers. We also source a portion of our yarns for our U.S. operation through our China facilities. The remainder of our yarn is obtained from other suppliers around the world.

&#160;

Product Design and Styling

Consumer tastes and preferences related to bedding and upholstered furniture change over time. The use of new fabrics and creative designs remains an important consideration for manufacturers to distinguish their products at retail and to capitalize on changes in preferred colors, patterns and textures. Culp&#8217;s success is largely dependent on our ability to market fabrics with appealing designs and patterns. The process of developing new designs involves maintaining an awareness of broad fashion and color trends both in the United States and internationally.

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Design innovation is a very important element of producing mattress fabrics. Price point delineation is accomplished through fabric quality as well as variation in design. Additionally, consumers are drawn to the mattress that is most visually appealing when walking into a retail showroom. Fiber differentiation also plays an important part in design. For example, rayon, organic cotton, and other special fibers are incorporated into the design process to allow the retailer to offer consumers additional benefits related to their sleeping experience. Similarly, many fabrics contain special production finishes that enhance fabric performance.

Mattress fabric designs are not routinely introduced on a scheduled season. Designs are typically introduced upon the request of the customer as they plan introduction to their retailers. Additionally, we work closely with our customers on new design offerings around the major furniture markets such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and High Point, North Carolina.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The company has developed an upholstery fabrics design and product development team (with staff located in the U.S. and in China) with a focus on value in designing body cloths, while promoting style leadership with pillow fabrics and color. Our design staff travels regularly to international trade and design shows to maintain familiarity with current design and fashion trends. The team searches continually for new ideas and for the best sources of raw materials, yarns, and fabrics, utilizing a supply network located mostly in China. Using these design elements, they develop product offerings using ideas and materials that take both fashion trends and cost considerations into account to offer products designed to meet the needs of furniture manufacturers and ultimately the desires of consumers.

Upholstery fabric designs are introduced at major fabric trade conferences that occur twice a year in the United States (June and December). In recent years, we have become more aggressive in registering copyrights for popular fabric patterns and taking steps to discourage the illegal copying of our proprietary designs.

&#160;

Distribution

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The vast majority of our shipments of mattress fabrics originate from our facilities in Stokesdale, North Carolina. Through arrangements with major customers and in accordance with industry practice, we maintain a significant inventory of mattress fabrics at our distribution facility in Stokesdale (&#8220;make to stock&#8221;), so that products may be shipped to customers with short lead times and on a &#8220;just in time&#8221; basis.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

A majority of our upholstery fabrics are marketed on a &#8220;make to order&#8221; basis and are shipped directly from our distribution facilities in Burlington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China. In addition to &#8220;make to order&#8221; distribution, an inventory of a limited number of fabric patterns is held at our distribution facilities in Burlington and Shanghai from which our customers can obtain quick delivery of sourced fabrics through a program known as &#8220;Culp Express.&#8221; Beginning in fiscal 2010 and continuing through fiscal 2016, market share opportunities have been expanded through strategic selling partnerships.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

&#160;

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of mattress fabric production costs. The mattress fabrics segment purchases synthetic yarns (polyester, polypropylene, and rayon), certain greige (unfinished) goods, latex adhesives, laminates, dyes, and other chemicals. Most of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products. The mattress fabrics segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of upholstery fabric manufacturing costs for products the company manufactures. This segment purchases synthetic yarns (polyester, acrylic, rayon, and polypropylene), acrylic staple fiber, latex adhesives, dyes, and other chemicals from various suppliers.

Increased reliance by both our U.S. and China upholstery operations on outside suppliers for basic production needs such as base fabrics, yarns, and finishing services has caused the upholstery fabrics segment to become more vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control. 

&#160;

Both Segments 

&#160;

Many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs can be sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. During fiscal 2015 and 2016, our profitability was aided by lower raw material prices due to lower oil prices.

&#160;

Seasonality

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The mattress fabrics business and the bedding industry in general are slightly seasonal, with sales being the highest in early spring and late summer, with another peak in mid-winter. 

&#160;

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The upholstery fabrics business is somewhat seasonal, with sales often higher during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. In the past, seasonality resulted from one-week closings of our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of most of our customers in the United States during our first and third fiscal quarters for the holiday weeks of July 4th and Christmas. This effect has become less pronounced as a larger portion of our fabrics are produced or sold in locations outside of the U.S. The timing of the Chinese National Holiday in October and the Chinese New Year (which occurs in January or February each year) now have a more significant impact on upholstery sales than the effects of U.S. holiday periods.

Competition

Competition for our products is high and is based primarily on price, design, quality, timing of delivery, and service.

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The mattress fabrics market is concentrated in a few relatively large suppliers. We believe our principal mattress fabric competitors are BekaertDeslee Textiles, Global Textile Alliance, and several smaller companies producing knitted and other fabric.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

In the upholstery fabrics market, we compete against a large number of companies, ranging from a few large manufacturers comparable in size to the company to small producers, and a growing number of &#8220;converters&#8221; of fabrics (companies who buy and re-sell, but do not manufacture fabrics). We believe our principal upholstery fabric competitors are Dorell Fabrics Co., Merrimack Fabrics, Morgan Fabrics, Richloom Fabrics and Specialty Textile, Inc. (or STI), plus a large number of smaller competitors (both manufacturers and converters).

The trend in the upholstery fabrics industry to greater overseas competition and the entry of more converters has caused the upholstery fabrics industry to become substantially more fragmented in recent years, with lower barriers to entry. This has resulted in a larger number of competitors selling upholstery fabrics, with an increase in competition based on price.

&#160;

Environmental and Other Regulations

We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and federal and state environmental laws, as well as similar laws governing our manufacturing facilities in China and Canada. We periodically review our compliance with these laws and regulations in an attempt to minimize the risk of violations.

&#160;

Our operations involve a variety of materials and processes that are subject to environmental regulation. Under current law, environmental liability can arise from previously owned properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as from properties currently owned and leased by the company. Environmental liabilities can also be asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation.

In addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and analogous state statutes, liability can be imposed for the disposal of waste at sites targeted for cleanup by federal and state regulatory authorities. Liability under CERCLA is strict as well as joint and several.

The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that greenhouse gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. International agreements may also result in new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation, and electricity. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any new rules or regulations would affect our business, but we would expect the effect on our operations to be similar to that for other manufacturers, particularly those in our industry.

We are periodically involved in environmental claims or litigation and requests for information from environmental regulators. Each of these matters is carefully evaluated, and the company provides for environmental matters based on information presently available. Based on this information, we do not believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on either the company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with environmental matters will not increase in the future.

Employees

As of May 1, 2016, we had 1,217 employees, compared with 1,188 at the end of fiscal 2015. Overall, our total number of employees has remained fairly steady over the past five years, with increases in the mattress fabrics segment and decreases in the upholstery segment during that period.

The hourly employees at our manufacturing facility in Canada (approximately 14% of the company&#8217;s workforce) are represented by a local, unaffiliated union. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees expires on February 1, 2017. We are not aware of any efforts to organize any more of our employees, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

The following table illustrates the changes in the location of our workforce and number of employees, as of year-end, over the past five fiscal years.

Backlog

Mattress Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

The backlog for mattress fabric is not a reliable predictor of future shipments because the majority of sales are on a just-in-time basis.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment 

&#160;

Although it is difficult to predict the amount of backlog that is &#8220;firm,&#8221; we have reported the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog from customers with confirmed shipping dates within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year. On May 1, 2016, the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog with confirmed shipping dates prior to June 6, 2016, was $8.4 million, all of which are expected to be filled early during fiscal 2017, as compared to $9.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2015 (for confirmed shipping dates prior to June 7, 2015).
