 Item 1. Business 

References to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries, in all cases acting through its external advisor, unless context specifically requires otherwise. 

Overview 

We were formed to acquire, originate and asset manage a diversified portfolio of equity, debt and securities investments in healthcare real estate, directly or through joint ventures, with a focus on the mid-acuity senior housing sector, which we define as assisted living, or ALF, memory care, or MCF, skilled nursing, or SNF, independent living, or ILF, facilities and continuing care retirement communities which may have independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing and memory care available on one campus, or CCRC. We also invest in other healthcare property types, including medical office buildings, or MOB, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and ancillary services businesses. Our investments are predominantly in the United States, but we also selectively make international investments. We were formed in October 2010 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in February 2013. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended &#32; December 31, 2013 . We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

Our equity investments are generally healthcare properties, which are either structured as net leases to healthcare operators or operated through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly through the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA, structures that permit us, through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, to have direct exposure to resident fee income and incur related operating expenses. Our debt investments consist of first mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. As of December 31, 2015 , we did not own any securities investments. 

We are externally managed and have no employees. Prior to June 30, 2014, we were managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF), or NorthStar Realty. Effective June 30, 2014, NorthStar Realty spun-off its asset management business into a separate publicly traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), or our Sponsor. Our Sponsor and its affiliates provide asset management and other services to us, NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. (NYSE: NRE), other sponsored public retail-focused companies and any other companies our Sponsor and its affiliates may manage in the future, or collectively the NSAM Managed Companies, both in the United States and internationally. As of December 31, 2015 , NSAM had an aggregate of $38.0 billion &#32;of assets under management, adjusted for commitments to acquire or sell certain investments by NSAM and the NSAM Managed Companies. Concurrent with the spin-off, affiliates of our Sponsor entered into a new advisory agreement with us and each of the other NSAM Managed Companies. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, NSAM J-NSHC Ltd, an affiliate of our Sponsor, or our Advisor, agreed to manage our day-to-day operations on terms substantially similar to those set forth in our prior advisory agreement with NorthStar Healthcare Income Advisor, LLC, or our Prior Advisor. References to our Prior Advisor herein refer to the services performed by and fees paid and accrued to our Prior Advisor during the period prior to June 30, 2014. The spin-off of NorthStar Realty&#8217;s asset management business had no impact on our operations. 

Our primary investment types are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Equity - &#32;Our equity investments, directly or through joint ventures, focus on properties in the mid-acuity senior housing sector, which we define as ALF, MCF, SNF, ILF and CCRC. Our equity investments may also include MOB, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and ancillary services businesses. Our investments are predominantly in the United States, but we also selectively make international investments. Our healthcare properties generally operate under net leases or through management agreements with independent third-party operators. 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Debt &#32; - &#32;Our debt investment business focuses on originating, acquiring and asset managing healthcare-related debt investments and may include first mortgage loans, subordinate interests and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans, as well as preferred equity interests. 

&#8226; 

Healthcare-Related Securities - &#32;Our securities investments may include commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and other securities backed primarily by loans secured by healthcare properties. 

We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on real estate fundamentals and ability to apply similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect capital. 

We initially registered to offer up to 100.0 million &#32;shares pursuant to our primary offering to the public, or our Initial Primary Offering, and up to 10.5 million &#32;shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or our Initial DRP, which are herein collectively referred to as our Initial Offering. Our Initial Offering (including 8.6 million &#32;shares reallocated from our Initial DRP) was completed on February 2, 2015 &#32;by raising $1.1 billion . All of the shares initially registered for our Initial Offering were issued. 

On February 6, 2015 , our registration statement on Form S-11 was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for a follow-on public offering, or our Follow-on Offering, of up to $700.0 million, which included up to $500.0 million in shares pursuant to our follow-on primary offering, or our Follow-on Primary Offering, and up to $200.0 million in shares pursuant to our follow-on distribution reinvestment plan, or our Follow-on DRP. We stopped accepting subscriptions for our Follow-on Offering on December 17, 2015 and all of the shares initially registered (including $159.5 million &#32;of shares reallocated from our Follow-on DRP) for our Offering were issued on or before January 19, 2016. We registered an additional 30.0 million &#32;shares to be offered pursuant to our DRP beyond the completion of our Offering and continue to offer such shares. 

Our Initial Primary Offering and our Follow-on Primary Offering are collectively referred to as our Primary Offering and our distribution reinvestment plan, including but not limited to our Initial DRP and Follow-on DRP are collectively referred to as our DRP. Additionally, our Primary Offering and our Initial DRP and Follow-on DRP are collectively referred to as our Offering. 

NorthStar Securities, LLC, or our Dealer Manager, formerly a subsidiary of NorthStar Realty that became a subsidiary of our Sponsor upon completion of the spin-off, served as the dealer manager for our Primary Offering. 

On February 11, 2013, we commenced operations by satisfying our minimum offering requirement in our Initial Primary Offering as a result of NorthStar Realty purchasing 222,223 &#32;shares of common stock for $2.0 million . From inception through March 23, 2016 , we raised total gross proceeds of $1.8 billion .

Underwriting Process 

We use a rigorous investment and underwriting process that has been developed and utilized by our Advisor&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; senior management team leveraging their extensive commercial and healthcare real estate expertise over many years and real estate cycles, which focuses on some or all of the following factors designed to ensure each investment is being evaluated appropriately: (i) a property&#8217;s market, including applicable state regulations that may impact the local industry, local supply constraints, the quality and nature of the local workforce and prevailing local real estate values; (ii) fundamental analysis of underlying real estate, including rent rolls, material contracts, lease terms, zoning, necessary licensing, operating costs and the asset&#8217;s overall competitive position in the market; (iii) real estate market factors that may influence the economic performance of the investment including leasing conditions and overall competition; (iv) the operating expertise and financial strength and reputation of the borrower, operator/tenant or partner; (v) the cash flow in place and projected to be in place over the term of the investment and overall potential return; (vi) the appropriateness of the business plan and estimated costs associated with repositioning or capital improvements; (vii) an internal and third-party valuation of the property, the investment basis relative to the competitive set of comparable investments, the estimated replacement cost and the ability to liquidate an investment through a sale or refinancing; (viii) review of third-party reports including appraisals, engineering and environmental reports; (ix) physical inspections of properties; (x) the overall legal structure of the investment, contractual implications and the lenders&#8217; rights; (xi) insurance coverages and premiums; (xii) current and expected capitalization rates and lease coverage ratios; (xiii) the type and availability of third party project financing; (xiv) the tax and accounting impact; (xv) claims history; and (xvi) for debt investments, the borrower credit, loan collateral, lease reserves, debt service coverage ratios, security, reserve requirements, cash flow sweeps, call protection and recourse provisions. 

The following section describes the major asset classes in which we may invest and actively manage to maximize value and to protect capital. 

Real Estate Equity 

Overview 

Our real estate equity investment strategy is focused on acquiring interests in healthcare properties, directly or through joint ventures, with a focus on the mid-acuity senior housing sector, which we define as ALF, MCF, SNF, ILF and CCRC. We also invest in other healthcare property types, including MOB, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and ancillary services businesses. Our investments are predominantly in the United States, but we also selectively make international investments. 

Our equity investments are generally healthcare properties, which are either structured as net leases to healthcare operators or operated through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly under the RIDEA structure, whereby we participate directly in the operational cash flow of a property, we generate resident level income from short-term residential agreements and incur customary related operating expenses. 

We believe that mid-acuity senior housing facilities may provide an opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Mid-acuity senior housing facilities benefit from positive demographic and economic trends and generally provide the broadest level of services to residents in a cost-effective setting resulting in a longer length of stay for residents and less turnover in tenancy than in some other healthcare settings. 

Our Portfolio 

As of December 31, 2015 , $3.2 billion , or 94.3% &#32;of our assets, were invested in healthcare real estate equity, adjusted through March 1, 2016 for the acquisition of all of the interests in the Winterfell portfolio.

Real Estate Debt 

Overview 

Our real estate debt investment strategy is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing debt, secured by the same property types that we target for our real estate equity investments, including first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. 

We emphasize direct origination of our debt investments as this allows us a greater degree of control over how they are underwritten and structured and it provides us the opportunity to syndicate all or a portion (i.e., senior or subordinate interests) in a loan, if desired. Further, it facilitates a more direct relationship with our borrowers which helps us maintain a robust pipeline and provides an opportunity for us to earn origination and other fees. 

Our Portfolio 

As of December 31, 2015 , $193.4 million , or 5.7% &#32;of our assets, was invested in real estate debt secured by healthcare facilities, consisting of four &#32;loans with an average investment size of $48.4 million . The weighted average extended maturity of our real estate debt portfolio is 4.1 &#32;years.

Classification based on predominant services provided, but may include other services. 

Healthcare-Related Securities 

Our healthcare-related securities investment strategy may include investing primarily in CMBS, and may include other healthcare-related securities, backed primarily by loans secured by a variety of healthcare properties. We expect that this asset class will be less than 10% of our total portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 , we did not own any securities investments. 

Financing Strategy 

We use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy to prudently leverage our investments while managing refinancing and interest rate risk. Our Advisor is responsible for managing such financing and interest rate risk on our behalf. We consider a variety of financing arrangements such as mortgage notes, credit facilities, securitization financing transactions and other term borrowings. We continue to seek and prefer long-term, non-recourse financing. We may, as circumstances warrant, utilize some level of recourse financing. 

Our financing strategy for our real estate equity investments is typically to seek long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans. For our debt and securities investments, we seek to obtain match-funded borrowings whenever possible at rates that provide a positive net spread, generally using credit facilities and securitization financing transactions. Our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. 

In November 2013, we entered into a credit facility agreement, or our Term Loan Facility, to finance real estate investments and first mortgage loans secured by healthcare real estate. On September 28, 2015, we voluntarily terminated our Term Loan Facility, as we have been able to obtain attractive asset-level borrowings to finance our investments and no amounts were drawn under our Term Loan Facility. 

Although we have a limitation on the maximum leverage for our portfolio, which approximates 75% of our assets (excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments), other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, we do not have a targeted debt-to-equity ratio on an asset-by-asset basis, as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we finance depends on the specific credit characteristics of each asset. We use leverage for the sole purpose of financing our investments and diversifying our equity and we do not employ leverage to speculate on changes in interest rates. We also seek assignable financing when available. Once we have fully invested the proceeds of our Offering, we expect that our financing may approximate 50% of the cost of our investments, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments. 

Portfolio Management 

Our Advisor and its affiliates, directly or together with third party sub-advisors, maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes oversight by the asset management team, regular management meetings and an exhaustive quarterly credit review process. These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific credit issues and trends on a portfolio-wide, sub-portfolio or by asset type basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our Advisor&#8217;s review, or any third parties acting on our or our Advisor&#8217;s behalf, will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from issues that are not identified during these credit reviews. 

Our Advisor has delegated certain asset management functions in connection with our portfolio to American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or AHI. As of December 31, 2015, AHI provides these asset management services in connection with our Griffin-American, Winterfell and Trilogy portfolios and we expect AHI to provide these asset management services for the balance of our portfolio (other than joint ventures with Formation Capital LLC, or Formation) beginning in the second or third quarter of 2016. In addition, Formation provides similar asset management services to us in connection with the Eclipse, Espresso and Envoy joint ventures. Our Advisor&#8217;s asset management team, under the direction of our Advisor&#8217;s investment committee, supervises AHI and Formation and retains ultimate oversight and responsibility for the management of our portfolio. 

Our Advisor&#8217;s asset management team, together with AHI or Formation, uses many methods to actively manage our asset base to enhance or preserve our income, value and capital. Our Advisor, together with AHI or Formation, seeks to identify strategic development opportunities for our existing and future investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide optimal mix of services and enhance the overall value of our assets. To manage risk, frequent review and dialogue with operators/managers/borrowers and regular inspections of our owned properties and collateral have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early. In addition, our Advisor, together with AHI or Formation, considers the impact of regulatory changes on the performance of our portfolio. During the quarterly credit review, or more frequently as necessary, investments are put on highly-monitored status, as appropriate, based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in performance and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment. Each situation depends on many factors, including the number of properties, the type of property, macro and local market conditions impacting supply/demand, cash flow and the financial condition of our operators/managers/borrowers. Our Advisor, together with AHI or Formation, as applicable, uses an experienced asset management team that monitors these factors on our behalf. 

Our investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstances among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant/operator/resident receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of tenant/operator/resident to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, allowance for future operator/tenant credit losses on unbilled rents receivable based upon an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts. 

One of our operators, which accounts for 3.0% &#32;of the total revenue attributable to our direct investments, recently failed to timely pay its full rental obligations and satisfy certain covenants under certain leases. As a result, we were required to fund additional reserves under the mortgage note payable relating to the portfolio. We are currently evaluating the situation to determine the appropriate course of action. 

As of December 31, 2015 , except as discussed above, our direct investments were performing in accordance with the contractual terms of their governing documents, in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record impairment, as appropriate, if required. 

Independent Directors&#8217; Review of Our Policies 

As required by our charter, our independent directors have reviewed our policies, including but not limited to our policies regarding investments, leverage, conflicts of interest and investment allocation and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our key policies that provide the basis for such determination are summarized herein. 

Regulation 

We are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: 

&#8226; 

regulate our public disclosures, reporting obligations and capital raising activity; 

&#8226; 

require compliance with applicable REIT rules; 

&#8226; 

regulate healthcare operators, including those in the senior housing sector that may be our borrowers or operators, with respect to licensure, certification for participation in government programs and relationships with patients, physicians, tenants and other referral sources; 

&#8226; 

establish loan servicing standards; 

&#8226; 

regulate credit granting activities; 

&#8226; 

require disclosures to customers; 

&#8226; 

govern secured transactions; 

&#8226; 

set collection, taking title to collateral, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices; 

&#8226; 

regulate land use and zoning; 

&#8226; 

regulate the foreign ownership or management of real property or mortgages; 

&#8226; 

regulate the ability of foreign persons or corporations to remove profits earned from activities within the country to the person&#8217;s or corporation&#8217;s country of origin; 

&#8226; 

regulate tax treatment and accounting standards; and 

&#8226; 

regulate use of derivative instruments and our ability to hedge our risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates. 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. If we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year after electing REIT status, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and will generally not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and cash available for distribution. However, we believe that we are organized and expect to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes thereafter. In addition, we have healthcare properties owned through structures permitted by RIDEA, where we participate directly in the operational cash flow of a property. 

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a provision referred to as t he Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which changes certain of the rules &#32;affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT stockholders described under the heading &#8220;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221; in our Prospectus included in our Registration Statement on Form S&#8209;3 filed December 7, 2015. These changes are briefly summarized as follows: 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT&#8217;s total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. 

&#8226; 

For distributions in taxable years beginning after 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to us as a &#8220;publicly offered REIT,&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 562(c)(2). 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, but interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. Under a new asset test, not more than 25% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs and would not otherwise be treated as qualifying real estate assets. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property) , the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to &#8220;redetermined services income,&#8221; i.e., non-arm&#8217;s-length income of a REIT&#8217;s TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents) . 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains acquired from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. 

&#8226; 

REITs are subject to a 100% tax on net income from &#8220;prohibited transactions,&#8221; i.e., sales of dealer property (other than &#8220;foreclosure property&#8221;). These rules also contain safe harbors under which certain sales of real estate assets will not be treated as prohibited transactions. One of the requirements for the current safe harbors is that (I) the REIT does not make more than seven sales of property (subject to specified exceptions) during the taxable year at issue, or (II) the aggregate adjusted bases (as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits) of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the aggregate bases in the REIT&#8217;s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year, or (III) the fair market value of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the fair market value of the REIT&#8217;s total assets as of the beginning of the taxable year. If a REIT relies on clause (II) or (III), substantially all of the marketing and certain development expenditures with respect to the properties sold must be made through an independent contractor. For taxable years beginning after December 18, 2015, c lauses (II) and (III) are liberalized to permit the REIT to sell properties with an aggregate adjusted basis (or fair market value) of up to 20% of the aggregate bases in (or fair market value of) the REIT&#8217;s assets as long as the 10% standard is satisfied on average over the three-year period comprised of the taxable year at issue and the two immediately preceding taxable years. In addition, for taxable years beginning after 2015, for REITs that rely on clauses (II) or (III), a TRS may make the marketing and development expenditures that previously had to be made by independent contractors . 

&#8226; 

A number of changes applicable to REITs are made to the FIRPTA rules for taxing non-U.S. persons on gains from sales of U.S. real property interests (&#8220;USRPIs&#8221;): 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. 

&#8226; 

Effective December 18, 2015, new rules will simplify the determination of whether we are a &#8220;domestically controlled qualified investment entity.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(l)(2) and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from FIRPTA and FIRPTA withholding. New FIRPTA rules also apply to &#8220;qualified shareholders&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(k)(3). 

&#8226; 

For sales of USRPIs occurring after February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate for sales of USRPIs and certain distributions generally increases from 10% to 15%. 

We believe that we are not, and intend to conduct our operations so as not to become, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. We have relied, and intend to continue to rely, on current interpretations of the staff of the SEC in an effort to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. For more information on the exemptions that we use refer to Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Maintenance of our Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our operations .&#8221; 

We own and manage healthcare properties. As such, we or our operators, as the case may be, are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied 

retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing laws. Refer to &#8220;Healthcare Regulation&#8221; below. 

We are also subject to regulation governing mortgage lending. Although most states do not regulate commercial real estate finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial real estate loans. 

Real estate properties owned by us and the operations of such properties are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. In addition, such properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, the Fair Housing Act, applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations. For further information regarding environmental matters and the ADA, refer to &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; and &#8220;ADA&#8221; below. 

In the judgment of management, while we do incur significant expense complying with the various regulations to which we are subject, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

For additional information regarding regulations applicable to us, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Environmental Matters 

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our properties. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner&#8217;s or secured lender&#8217;s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. 

ADA 

Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect. 

Healthcare Regulation 

Overview 

Assisted living, memory care, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and industry standards governing their operations. Failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in loss of licensure; loss of certification or accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and sanctions; suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or closure of the facility. Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the area of fraud and abuse, among others. We also expect that efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurers, to impose greater and more stringent cost controls upon operators will intensify and continue. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement, and enforcement activity can all have a significant effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, managers and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us, as set forth below and under Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this report. 

Healthcare Reform 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA, and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends PPACA, collectively, the Health Reform Laws, and certain follow-on laws (e.g., the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Transformation Act of 2014, or IMPACT) serve as the primary vehicle for comprehensive healthcare reform in the United States and are becoming effective through a phased approach, which began in 2010 and will conclude in 2018. The laws are intended to reduce the number of individuals in the United States without health insurance and significantly change the means by which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. Among other provisions, the legislation includes: (i) program integrity provisions that both create new authorities and expand existing authorities for federal and state governments to address fraud, waste and abuse in federal health programs; (ii) expanded reporting requirements and responsibilities related to property ownership and management, patient safety and care quality; and (iii) new initiatives to strengthen post-acute care services and promote relationships between acute and post-acute care providers. The inability or failure to comply with these reform laws could impact the ability of our operators and tenants to participate in federal healthcare programs, causing revenues to decline and ultimately impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us. 

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement 

Healthcare providers, including, but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and some senior housing facilities), are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern their operations and arrangements with referral sources. These laws include: (i) laws requiring providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service; (ii) state anti-kickback laws and the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibit persons from offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a government healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid; (iii) the federal physician self-referral law (commonly known as the Stark Law), which generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment that were the result of a referral by a physician who has a financial relationship with the health service provider and analogous state laws; and (iv) the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act including its &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services. Additionally, certain laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Reform Laws have broadened the federal fraud and abuse laws to enhance both the scope and the penalties for non-compliance with the laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from government healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us. Additionally, private lawsuits brought under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry have resulted in increased enforcement activity and can involve significant monetary damages and awards to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. 

Reimbursement 

Federal, state and private payor reimbursement methodologies applied to healthcare providers continue to evolve. Federal and state healthcare financing authorities are implementing new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact healthcare property operations. Additional changes may be considered and implemented in the future, and those also could negatively impact healthcare property operations. A new presidential administration in 2017 also could set the country on a different course with respect to health insurance and payment. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our healthcare property operations. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including private insurers and self-pay patients. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews, and other audits by federal and state authorities. Federal and state authorities are increasing their scrutiny of payments for items and services, and are increasingly decreasing or denying payments to providers. A review or audit of a property operator&#8217;s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future, each of which could have a significant negative consequence. 

Medicare Reimbursement . Medicare, a federal program, is a significant payor source for our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System, or SNF PPS. Hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems which vary based upon the type of hospital, geographic location and service furnished. Most SNF and hospital prospective payment systems pay a pre-determined fixed fee for defined services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. For skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, there is a substantial risk that costs will exceed the fixed payments, and payments will be insufficient as compared to actual costs of delivering care, which could result in financial difficulties for the facilities. Federal legislation enacted in recent years imposes considerable pressure on long-term care facilities to focus services on patients with certain complex diagnoses. This legislation will substantially reduce payments for some long-term care hospitals, and result in others losing their long-term care hospital designation and eligibility for higher 

payments attendant that status. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program, seeks to reduce spending and improve the quality of services furnished to program beneficiaries. In pursuit of these goals, CMS is reducing the amount it pays for services, linking payment to performance relative to quality and other metrics, and bundling payments for multiple items and services in a way that shifts more financial risk to providers. Additionally, CMS is establishing policies intended to encourage providers to collaborate and coordinate care. These changes could reduce payments and patient volumes for some facilities, which could result in financial challenges for our healthcare property operations. Congress also is examining payments to providers of similar services, and contemplating legislation that would equalize payments across settings for similar services such that a long-term care hospital, for example, could be paid the same amount as a SNF for comparable services. These site-neutral policies also could have a detrimental effect on payments to providers of services. Recent attention on billing practices and payments and/or ongoing payment program reforms and government pressure to reduce spending by government healthcare programs, could result in lower payments to skilled nursing facilities and/or hospitals and, as a result, may impair an operator&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations to us. 

Medicaid Reimbursement . Medicaid is also a significant payor source for our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. The federal and state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid. The percentage of Medicaid dollars used for long-term care varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse long-term care facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. In addition, federal budgetary proposals could have lower federal spending for Medicaid, potentially impacting provider Medicaid reimbursement rates. Finally, certain states have elected not to expand their Medicaid eligibility criteria pursuant to recent healthcare reform laws, as described further below. In these states, there may be fewer individuals receiving insurance through state Medicaid programs and healthcare providers may continue to have a population of uninsured patients that require treatment. Other states that have opted to expand Medicaid may later choose to discontinue or modify that expansion. Reductions in Medicaid reimbursement rates or patient eligibility could materially affect revenues of our facilities. Additionally, a new presidential administration in 2017 may seek substantial changes to the Health Reform Laws, including the components of the law that facilitate Medicaid expansion. Changes that induce states to roll-back eligibility expansion or otherwise decrease the number of individuals covered by Medicaid could have a materially negative effect on an operator&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations to us. 

Senior Housing Facilities (assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities, excluding skilled nursing facilities). &#32;&#32;While the majority of revenues received by the operators of our senior housing facilities are from private pay sources, a small portion of their revenue is received from Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program will continue to reimburse for services at current levels or continue to be available to our residents. Rates generated at facilities will vary by payor mix, market conditions and resident acuity. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. 

Licensure, Certification and CON 

Hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio are subject to extensive state licensing and registration laws. The failure of our operators and tenants to maintain or renew any required license, certification, accreditation or regulatory approval could prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. 

Certain of our healthcare facilities are subject to a variety of state certificate of need (CON) laws and regulations, which may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility&#8217;s size or services. In addition, CON laws and regulations may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. 

Information Privacy and Security 

Healthcare providers are subject to a myriad of state and federal laws which protect the privacy and security of information. HIPAA provides for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, strengthened the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Secretary&#8217;s authority to impose civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. 

Competition 

We compete, primarily on the basis of price, available capital, knowledge of the industry and flexibility of financing structure, with real estate partnerships, other REITs, independent owners and operators and other investors (including, but not limited to, 

banks and insurance companies) in the acquisition and financing of healthcare-related real estate assets. Among the factors adversely affecting our ability to compete are the following: 

&#8226; 

we may have less knowledge than our competitors of certain markets in which we seek to purchase, develop or finance facilities; 

&#8226; 

our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we have; and 

&#8226; 

our competitors or other entities may determine to pursue a strategy similar to ours. 

Our healthcare investments will experience local and regional market competition for residents, operators and staff. Competition will be based on quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, services offered, family preference, physicians, staff and price. Competition will come from independent operators as well as companies managing multiple properties, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than our operators. Some of these properties are operated for profit while others are owned by governmental agencies or tax-exempt, non-profit organizations. Competitive disadvantages at our healthcare investments may result in vacancies at facilities, reductions in net operating income and ultimately a reduction in shareholder value. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had no employees. Our Advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, advisory, marketing, investor relations and certain administrative services for us. 

Corporate Governance and Internet Address 

We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors. The audit committee of our board of directors is composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers and directors.
