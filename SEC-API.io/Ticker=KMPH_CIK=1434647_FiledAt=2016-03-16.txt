 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS.

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs that we believe will be improved versions of widely prescribed, approved drugs. We employ our Ligand Activated Therapy, or LAT, platform technology to create our prodrugs. Our most advanced product candidate, KP201/APAP, consists of KP201, our prodrug of hydrocodone, combined with acetaminophen, or APAP. We are developing KP201/APAP as an immediate release, or IR, product candidate for the short-term, or no longer than 14 days, management of acute pain. We designed KP201/APAP with abuse-deterrent properties to address the epidemic of opioid abuse in the United States. We submitted a new drug application, or NDA, under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, otherwise known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, for KP201/APAP to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in December 2015. The FDA subsequently accepted this NDA for priority review in February 2016. The FDA has set a target action date for review of the NDA under the Prescription Drug User Free Act, or PDUFA, of June 9, 2016. We are also building a pipeline of additional prodrug product candidates that target large market opportunities in pain and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

&#160;

Key members of our senior management, while at New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., were instrumental in the development of Vyvanse, a prodrug of amphetamine indicated for ADHD, through FDA approval. New River Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire plc in 2007 and Vyvanse generated over $1.7 billion in sales in 2015.

&#160;

We use our LAT platform technology to discover and develop prodrugs that improve one or more of the attributes of approved drugs, such as susceptibility to abuse, bioavailability and safety. A prodrug is a precursor chemical compound of a drug that is inactive or less than fully active, which is then converted in the body to its active form through a normal metabolic process. We primarily seek to develop prodrugs that will be eligible for approval under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, which allows us to rely on the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products, if we demonstrate such reliance is scientifically appropriate. Because our prodrugs are novel combinations of an FDA-approved drug, referred to as the parent drug, with one or more ligands, they may be new molecular entities, or NMEs, and thus may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection. An NME is a drug containing an active ingredient that has not been approved or marketed in the United States.

&#160;

IMS, a healthcare information firm, estimates that IR hydrocodone bitartrate, or HB, formulated in combination with APAP, or hydrocodone/APAP, products accounted for 127 million prescriptions in the United States in 2013. We designed KP201/APAP to offer significant benefits over these widely prescribed hydrocodone/APAP products. We believe that KP201/APAP will provide abuse-deterrence while offering equivalent efficacy to these products.

&#160;

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, prescription drug overdose death rates in the United States have increased five-fold since 1980, and by 2009, drug overdose deaths outnumbered deaths due to motor vehicle crashes. HHS also estimates that, in 2010, opioid analgesics were involved in approximately 60% of U.S. drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified.

&#160;

We designed KP201/APAP to deter tampering and abuse by selecting a molecular structure that prevents the release of the opioid upon crushing, physical manipulation and the application of other commonly employed extraction techniques. This approach to abuse-deterrence at the molecular level contrasts with other abuse-deterrent technologies, which are formulation-based, combining the opioid drug with another drug or use an abuse-deterrent capsule or physical matrix. We believe our molecular-based approach to abuse deterrence may be more effective than many formulation-based approaches. We believe the KP201 prodrug releases hydrocodone less effectively than hydrocodone bitartrate, the form of hydrocodone in Norco, upon intranasal administration. We also believe the KP201 prodrug has very poor solubility in blood, water and other solvents, thus rendering it unsuitable for intravenous, or IV, administration.

&#160;

We believe the data from our clinical trials suggest comparable bioavailability between the hydrocodone released from KP201/APAP and the hydrocodone in Vicoprofen, and comparable bioavailability between the APAP in KP201/APAP and the APAP in Ultracet. In addition, the FDA has confirmed that the results of our bioavailability trial comparing KP201/APAP to Norco, an approved hydrocodone/APAP combination product, support a finding that KP201/APAP is bioequivalent to Norco for hydrocodone. Vicoprofen, Ultracet and Norco are listed drugs that we cited in our 505(b)(2) NDA. Two drugs are said to be bioequivalent if there is no clinically significant difference in their bioavailability. Based on communications with the FDA, we believe that we will not be required to conduct any additional efficacy trials for KP201/APAP. At our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in May 2015, we received feedback on the bioequivalence findings to Norco, the potential sufficiency of our proposed preclinical and clinical data package to support our NDA and the design of our abuse liability studies.

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that KP201/APAP has the potential to be the first FDA-approved IR product for the short-term management of acute pain with the efficacy of hydrocodone/APAP combination products and abuse-deterrent labeling. We have conducted clinical trials designed with the goal of obtaining abuse-deterrent claims in our product label for KP201/APAP. We conducted these trials in accordance with guidance that the FDA finalized in 2015 specifying the necessary studies and data required for obtaining abuse-deterrent claims in a product label. We submitted our NDA to the FDA in December 2015 . The FDA subsequently accepted this NDA for priority review in February 2016. The FDA has set a target action date for review of the NDA under PDUFA of June 9, 2016. 

&#160;

Additionally, we intend to advance our pipeline of other product candidates for the treatment of various pain indications and ADHD and we anticipate reporting human proof-of-concept, or POC, data for three product candidates in 2016 and 2017. We filed an IND for KP511 in March 2016, and we expect to file an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for each of KP415 and KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2016, followed with an NDA for KP201/IR (APAP-free) as early as 2017. We plan to employ our LAT platform technology and development expertise to develop additional product candidates that address unmet medical needs in large, established markets. We believe our product candidates will be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection and we intend to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway when available, which we believe will reduce drug development time, risk and expense. We own worldwide commercial rights for all of our product candidates, including KP201/APAP, except that Shire has a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our patent portfolio consisted of 47 granted patents and 77 pending patent applications worldwide, including a granted U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering KP201, a granted U.S. patent covering KP201-related compositions-of-matter, and granted U.S. composition-of-matter patents covering the prodrugs underlying two of our other product candidates.

&#160;

Our Strategy

&#160;

Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel and proprietary prodrugs. Key components of our strategy are:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Secure FDA approval for KP201/APAP as the first IR pain therapeutic product with the efficacy of hydrocodone/APAP combination products and an abuse-deterrent label . We are developing KP201/APAP for the short-term management of acute pain. We submitted a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA in December 2015. The FDA subsequently accepted this NDA for priority review in February 2016. The FDA has set a target action date for review of the NDA under PDUFA of June 9, 2016. Prior to product launch, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, would then need to determine the controlled substance schedule of KP201/APAP, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA, which we expect could occur as early as the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercialize KP201/APAP . We intend to evaluate U.S. commercialization options for KP201/APAP, if it is approved by the FDA, including pursuing a commercial collaboration, building a proprietary sales force, utilizing a contract sales force or pursuing a strategic transaction. We may also license the international commercial rights to KP201/APAP to one or more collaborators. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Advance the development of our other pipeline product candidates . We plan to advance the development of KP201/IR (APAP-free), our APAP-free formulation of our prodrug of hydrocodone, for the short-term management of acute pain, KP415, our prodrug of methylphenidate, for the treatment of ADHD, KP511/ER, our extended release, or ER, formulation of our prodrug for hydromorphone, for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate, KP606/IR, our IR formulation of our prodrug of oxycodone, for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate, and KP746, our prodrug of oxymorphone, for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. We plan to advance three of these product candidates through human proof-of-concept trials to evaluate their bioequivalence to appropriate FDA-approved drugs, and expect to report data from these trials in 2016 and 2017. We filed an IND for KP511 in March 2016, and we expect to file INDs for KP415 and KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2016, following with an NDA for KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2017. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our LAT platform technology to develop additional product candidates . We plan to employ our LAT platform technology to develop additional prodrugs that have improved properties over approved drugs and address unmet medical needs in large, established markets. We intend to develop prodrugs of FDA-approved drugs in multiple therapeutic areas. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to build a global intellectual property portfolio . We intend to vigorously pursue composition-of-matter patent protection for our prodrugs in markets covering a majority of the global commercial opportunity. As of December 31, 2015, our patent portfolio consisted of 47 granted patents and 77 pending patent applications worldwide, including a granted U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering KP201, a granted U.S. patent covering KP201-related compositions-of-matter, and granted U.S. composition-of-matter patents covering KP511, the prodrug underlying our KP511/ER product candidate, and KP415, the prodrug underlying our KP415 product candidate. &#160;

&#160;

Our LAT Prodrug Platform Technology

&#160;

We use our LAT platform technology to create prodrugs by chemically attaching one or more molecules, referred to as ligands, to an FDA-approved parent drug. We typically use ligands that have been demonstrated to be safe in toxicological studies or have been granted Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, status for food use by the FDA. Our prodrugs are chemical successors of the parent drugs, but may be considered to be NMEs and thus may be eligible for protection by composition-of-matter patents. When the prodrug is administered to a patient as intended, the targeted human metabolic processes, such as those in the GI tract, separate the ligand from the prodrug and release the parent drug, which can then exert its therapeutic effect. We select particular ligands that, when combined with the parent drug, create prodrugs designed to have improved drug attributes while maintaining efficacy equivalent to the parent drug.

&#160;

We believe that our LAT platform technology offers the following potential benefits:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved drug properties . We seek to develop prodrugs with improved attributes over FDA-approved drugs, such as reduced susceptibility to abuse, enhanced bioavailability and increased safety. For example, the molecular structure of KP201/APAP is designed to resist tampering and deter abuse. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Composition-of-matter patent protection . Our prodrugs combine an FDA-approved parent drug with one or more ligands to create NMEs and may be eligible for patent protection as novel compositions of matter, provided that all other applicable requirements are met. We seek patent protection not only for our prodrug product candidates, but also for related compounds with the intention of creating heightened barriers to market entry. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Eligibility for 505(b)(2) NDA pathway . Our LAT platform technology allows us to develop prodrugs that may be eligible to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Under that regulatory pathway, if we are able to demonstrate the bioequivalence of our product candidates to appropriate approved drugs, we will then be able to reference the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the approved drugs in our 505(b)(2) NDA submissions. This may allow us to avoid the significant time and expense of conducting large clinical trials and eliminate the need for some preclinical activities. 

&#160;

The Epidemic of Prescription Drug Abuse in the United States

&#160;

The United States is facing a growing epidemic of prescription drug abuse. According to HHS, prescription drug overdose death rates in the United States have increased five-fold since 1980, and by 2009, drug overdose deaths outnumbered deaths due to motor vehicle crashes. HHS also estimates that opioid analgesics were involved in approximately 60% of U.S. drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified in 2010. The economic costs of this public health problem are significant. A study published in 2011 in a peer-reviewed medical journal estimated that the costs of the non-medical use of prescription opioids in the United States are over $50 billion annually, including medical and substance abuse treatment costs, lost work productivity and criminal justice costs.

&#160;

The increasing negative social consequences and costs of prescription drug abuse have led to a number of regulatory and legislative actions and proposals, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA Guidance . In January 2013, the FDA published draft guidance with regard to the evaluation and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids. The guidance was published in final form in April 2015. The FDA guidance provides direction as to the studies and data required for obtaining abuse-deterrent claims in a product label. The draft guidance describes four categories of label claims for abuse-deterrent products. Depending on product and study data, a combination of categories can be included in the label claims. The FDA guidance lists the following theoretical examples: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Category 1&#8211;in vitro data demonstrate the product has physical and chemical properties that are expected to deter intravenous abuse. However, abuse is still possible by the oral and nasal routes. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Category 1 and 2&#8211;in vitro data demonstrate that the product has physical and chemical properties that are expected to deter oral, nasal and intravenous abuse. However, abuse of intact product is still possible by the oral route. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Category 2 and 3&#8211;pharmacokinetic and clinical abuse potential studies indicate that the product has properties that are expected to deter abuse via the oral, intranasal and intravenous routes. However, abuse of product by these routes is still possible. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Category 4&#8211;data demonstrated a reduction in the abuse of the product in the community setting compared to the levels of abuse, overdose, and death that occurred when only formulations of the same opioid without abuse-deterrent properties were available. This reduction in abuse appears to be attributable to the product&#8217;s formulation, which deters abuse by injection or snorting of the manipulated product. However, such abuse of this product is still possible, and the product&#8217;s abuse deterrence properties do not deter abuse associated with swallowing the intact formulation. 

&#160;

If a product is approved by the FDA to include such claims in its label, the applicant may use information about the abuse-deterrent features of the product in its marketing efforts to physicians.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA Authority . In an April 2013 letter to the U.S. House of Representatives&#8217; Committee on Energy and Commerce, the FDA outlined its authority to address the issue of prescription opioid abuse in the United States. The FDA asserted that, if it determines that a formulation of an extended-release opioid drug product has abuse-deterrent properties, it has the authority to refrain from approving non-abuse-deterrent formulations of the drug and to initiate procedures to withdraw the non-abuse-deterrent formulations already on the market. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA Action . The FDA has approved the inclusion of language regarding the ability to deter abuse in the product labels for five abuse-deterrent opioids, OxyContin, Targiniq ER, Embeda, Hysingla and MorphaBond. These actions reinforce the FDA&#8217;s public statement that the development of abuse-deterrent opioid analgesics is a public health priority. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

STOPP Act . In July 2012, a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders introduced the STOPP (Stop the Tampering of Prescription Pills) Act. Reintroduced in May 2015, the STOPP Act would require that non-abuse-deterrent opioids be removed from the market if an abuse-deterrent formulation of the same opioid is approved for marketing by the FDA. The STOPP Act is currently assigned to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce&#8217;s Subcommittee on Health. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA Public Meeting . In October 2014, the FDA hosted a public meeting to discuss the development, assessment and regulation of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid medications. In the announcement for the public meeting, the FDA anticipated that, after abuse-deterrent formulations become available for a number of different opioid medications and after it gains more experience with formulations with meaningful abuse-deterrent properties, the FDA may determine that the risks outweigh the benefits for all or most opioid products without abuse-deterrent properties. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Prodrug Product Candidates

&#160;

We have employed our LAT platform technology to create a portfolio of product candidates that we believe will offer significant improvements over FDA-approved and widely prescribed drugs. Our pipeline of product candidates is summarized in the table below:

KP201/APAP

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

Our most advanced product candidate, KP201/APAP, is an IR combination of KP201, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and APAP. We are developing KP201/APAP for the short-term management of acute pain. KP201/APAP is designed to be an abuse-deterrent opioid product that offers equivalent efficacy to the existing standard-of-care, IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products, such as Vicodin, Norco and Lortab. KP201 combines hydrocodone with the ligand benzoic acid to form benzhydrocodone and can be formulated in both IR and ER dosage forms. KP201 is designed not to release its hydrocodone component until it is metabolized in the GI tract following oral administration. We believe KP201/APAP is highly tamper-resistant and is stable under conditions that can potentially defeat many other abuse-deterrent technologies.

&#160;

&#160;

The graphic below illustrates the steps required to extract abusable opioid from traditional opioid products that do not incorporate abuse-deterrent technology, from many formulation-based abuse-deterrent products and from KP201/APAP. We believe the molecular-based abuse-deterrent characteristics of KP201/APAP present a higher barrier to abuse than many formulation-based abuse- deterrent approaches.

&#160;

Number and Complexity of Steps Required to Access Abusable Opioid

&#160;

&#160;

We are seeking approval of KP201/APAP under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, which permits companies to rely upon the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product or products and published medical and scientific literature. We submitted our 505(b)(2) NDA for KP201/APAP to the FDA in December 2015. The FDA subsequently accepted this NDA for priority review in February 2016. The FDA has set a target action date for review of the NDA under PDUFA of June 9, 2016. However, we are relying in our 505(b)(2) NDA in part on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of Vicoprofen, a product that has two listed patents in the FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. Both listed patents expire in June 2017. As a result, FDA approval of our 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed until June 10, 2017 or later if the patent or NDA holder files a patent infringement claim against us. In addition, and prior to product launch, the DEA would also need to determine the controlled substance schedule of KP201/APAP, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. Subject to potential delay as a result of any delay in approval of our 505(b)(2) NDA, we expect the DEA could make a scheduling determination as early as the third quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

IMS estimates that in 2013, IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products represented the most frequently prescribed opioid products in the United States, accounting for 127 million U.S. prescriptions. Typically, patients are instructed to take four pills per day and prescriptions provide approximately 14 days of therapy. Hydrocodone is associated with more drug abuse and diversion than any other opioid and IR hydrocodone abuse results in more emergency department visits than any other prescription opioid. Currently, there are no IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products approved in the United States with an abuse-deterrent label.

&#160;

Key Product Features of KP201/APAP

&#160;

We believe KP201/APAP, if approved by the FDA, may have many valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely prescribed IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Molecular-based abuse-deterrent technology . Unlike formulation-based opioid abuse-deterrent approaches, KP201/APAP incorporates our LAT platform technology to create its abuse-deterrent properties at the molecular level. This may provide a higher barrier against attempted abuse than many existing formulation-based approaches. Physical manipulation, common solvent extraction, smoking and other conventional extraction methods applied to KP201/APAP do not release significant amounts of hydrocodone when compared to hydrocodone/APAP. We believe the KP201 prodrug releases hydrocodone less 

&#160;

&#160;

effectively than hydrocodone bitartrate upon intranasal administration and has very poor solubility in blood, water and other solvents, thus rendering it unsuitable for IV administration. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Composition-of-matter patent protection . KP201/APAP is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on KP201 that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2031. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic market opportunities, and, as of December 31, 2015, KP201 had received granted, issued or allowed patent status in 14 foreign jurisdictions and patent applications covering KP201 were pending in an additional 16 foreign jurisdictions. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No generic equivalent product . KP201 is a prodrug with a new chemical name, benzhydrocodone. We expect KP201/APAP, if approved, will have a lower prescribed milligram strength of KP201 than the therapeutic equivalent amount of hydrocodone bitartrate used in existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products. The difference in chemical name and prescription strength will mean that there will be no generic equivalent product for KP201/APAP in most states, making substitution difficult at the pharmacy. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Convenient dosing . Based on data from our food-effect clinical trial, we believe that KP201/APAP can be administered under both fed and fasting conditions and, accordingly, we believe that KP201/APAP will be as convenient as existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products. 

&#160;

KP201/APAP Clinical Development Program

&#160;

We submitted our 505(b)(2) NDA for KP201/APAP to the FDA in December 2015. The FDA subsequently accepted this NDA for priority review in February 2016. The FDA has set a target action date for review of the NDA under PDUFA of June 9, 2016. We are seeking approval of KP201/APAP under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, which permits companies to rely upon the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products and published medical and scientific literature. We completed a bioavailability trial comparing KP201/APAP to Norco, an approved hydrocodone/APAP combination product, and the FDA confirmed at our May 2015 pre-NDA meeting that the results of the trial support a finding that KP201/APAP is bioequivalent to Norco for hydrocodone. For APAP, the FDA found that KP201/APAP was close to meeting the agency&#8217;s metrics for bioequivalence but that we may be able to justify the difference. In order to rely on the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product in a 505(b)(2) NDA, the approved product must be an NDA product. Because there are no approved NDAs for hydrocodone/APAP combination products, including for Norco, we are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of hydrocodone and the safety and effectiveness of APAP separately through other methods. We completed a bridging bioavailability trial of KP201/APAP and Vicoprofen, an FDA-approved hydrocodone/ibuprofen combination NDA product. The data from this trial suggests comparable bioavailability between the hydrocodone released from KP201/APAP and the hydrocodone in Vicoprofen. We also completed a bridging bioavailability trial of KP201/APAP and Ultracet, an FDA-approved tramadol/APAP combination NDA product. The data from this trial suggests comparable bioavailability between the APAP in KP201/APAP and the APAP in Ultracet. We referenced the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for the hydrocodone component of Vicoprofen and the APAP component of Ultracet in our 505(b)(2) NDA. Based on communications with the FDA, we believe that no additional efficacy trials will be required for KP201/APAP.

&#160;

We also conducted two human abuse liability trials and one intranasal bioavailability study, each of which generated data that we included in our 505(b)(2) NDA submission. We designed these trials and this study with the goal of obtaining abuse-deterrent claims in our product label for KP201/APAP in accordance with FDA guidance.

&#160;

Clinical Trials and Bioavailability Studies.

&#160;

Abuse Quotient and Relative Abuse Potential. Clinical observations suggest that euphoric effects are enhanced both by increasing the peak plasma concentration, or Cmax, of an active opioid and by reducing the time to peak plasma concentration, or Tmax. The higher the opioid concentrations are in the blood and brain, and the faster they rise, the greater the reward to the abuser. It has also become apparent, however, that neither Tmax nor Cmax considered alone are sufficient to predict euphoria. Both parameters are important and need to be evaluated together.

&#160;

As a result, the abuse quotient, or AQ, calculated as Cmax/Tmax, has been introduced to allow numerical assessment of peak drug exposure relative to the rate of rise in plasma concentration. AQ increases both as Cmax is increased and as Tmax is shortened. Thus higher AQ scores suggest greater abuse potential.

&#160;

&#160;

The AQ values for all treatments we assessed in studies KP201.A01, KP201.A02 and KP201.A03, our abuse deterrence clinical trials and intranasal bioavailability study, have been calculated to allow comparison of their relative abuse potentials based on pharmacokinetics and hydrocodone exposure, and are shown in the table below:

SD = Standard Deviation 

&#160;

Of all the treatments we evaluated, intranasal KP201, either with or without APAP, had the lowest AQ when administered at an equimolar dose. This was the case when compared to oral KP201/APAP and when compared to all other hydrocodone treatments included in the trials, whether with or without APAP, oral or intranasal.

&#160;

KP201 Pilot Pharmacokinetics and Comparative Bioavailability Trials . We submitted our IND application for KP201 to the FDA in January 2011, and conducted our first human clinical trial of KP201 from February through March 2011. This trial was intended to provide proof of concept of KP201&#8217;s bioavailability compared to Norco. This trial assessed the pharmacokinetics of KP201, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, an opioid resulting from the metabolism of hydrocodone, over a 24-hour period after oral administration of KP201 at doses of 5 mg and 10 mg and the commercially available tablet version of Norco (10 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate / 325 mg of APAP) under fasted conditions. The 10 mg dose of KP201 and the tablet version of Norco are equimolar, meaning the number of KP201 molecules in the KP201 dose is the same as the number of molecules of hydrocodone in the Norco dose. Pharmacokinetics refers to the process by which a drug is distributed and metabolized in the body, including information on drug levels in the systemic circulation and how these levels change over time. A total of 24 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the trial and 21 of the subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that the plasma concentrations for both hydrocodone and hydromorphone after administration of 10 mg of KP201 were comparable to the levels following an equimolar dose of Norco and the results were within the statistical parameters established for bioequivalence by the FDA. In addition, we observed dose proportionality of 5 mg of KP201 as compared to 10 mg of KP201. The systemic exposure to intact KP201 was below the measurement threshold in each subject at all of the measurement points.

&#160;

A total of 58 adverse events following dose administration were reported over the course of the trial. Of these, 35 were mild and 23 were moderate. We do not believe any of the adverse events were occurring in the trial unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

KP201/APAP Bioequivalence Trial . In August 2013, we conducted our second human clinical trial of KP201, an open-label, bioequivalence trial comparing KP201/APAP to Norco. The primary objective of this trial was to compare the pharmacokinetic profile and exposure of hydrocodone, hydromorphone and APAP over a 24-hour period after a single dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg) relative to a single dose of Norco (7.5 mg / 325 mg) when administered orally under fasted conditions. These doses of KP201/APAP and Norco are equimolar even though the milligram dose of each drug per tablet is slightly different. Randomized subjects received two single-dose treatments, each separated by a seven-day washout period. A total of 30 healthy volunteers participated in the trial and 23 of the subjects completed it. 

&#160;

&#160;

The following charts summarize the bioequivalence data from this trial.

KP201/APAP Bioequivalence Trial

Note: HC refers to hydrocodone and HM refers to hydromorphone

&#160;

The results of the trial were that the plasma concentration levels for hydrocodone, hydromorphone and APAP after administration of KP201/APAP were comparable to the levels following an equimolar dose of Norco, and the results for hydrocodone and hydromorphone were within the statistical parameters established for bioequivalence by the FDA. The bioavailability data for APAP was slightly outside of the statistical range for bioequivalence.

&#160;

In addition, systemic exposure to intact KP201 was below the measurement threshold in each subject at all of the measurement points. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

KP201/APAP Multi-Dose/Steady State Trial . This trial, which we conducted in July and August 2013, was intended to assess the pharmacokinetics of KP201 after single and multiple doses of KP201/APAP in healthy volunteers. The primary objectives of this trial were to assess the pharmacokinetics of KP201, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and APAP following a single dose of two KP201/APAP tablets (6.67 mg / 325 mg) and to assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics of KP201, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and APAP following 13 doses of two KP201/APAP tablets administered every four hours under fasted conditions. A total of 26 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the trial and 24 of the subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that all plasma concentrations of KP201 were below the measurement threshold at all time points for all subjects, indicating that there was no systemic exposure to the prodrug even after administration of two tablets every four hours for 13 doses. Naltrexone, a narcotic antagonist, was administered to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects often associated with administration of opioids. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

KP201/APAP Food-Effect Trial . This trial, which we conducted in December 2013 and January 2014, was intended to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and APAP from KP201/APAP tablets, as well as to assess the relative bioavailability of hydrocodone and APAP from KP201/APAP tablets as compared to equimolar doses of Norco, each under fed conditions. Randomized subjects received a single dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg) administered orally under fed conditions in one period, a single dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg) under fasted conditions in one period, and a single dose of Norco (7.5 mg / 325 mg) under fed conditions in one period. Fed conditions reflected an FDA-standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. A total of 42 healthy adult volunteers enrolled in the trial and 38 of the subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that there were no overall changes in exposure to hydrocodone or to APAP when KP201/APAP tablets were administered under fed conditions that would be of clinical significance compared to KP201/APAP administered under fasted conditions or compared to Norco administered under fed conditions. We believe the data from this trial suggest there is no food effect with regard to the administration of KP201/APAP and that the labeling for KP201 could indicate that it can be administered without regard to meals.

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, systemic exposure to intact KP201 was below the measurement threshold in each subject at all of the measurement points. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication. 

&#160;

Comparative Bioavailability of KP201/APAP and Vicoprofen Trial . This trial, which was conducted in June and July 2014, was intended to assess the relative bioavailability of KP201/APAP compared to Vicoprofen in order to allow us to reference the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of Vicoprofen in our 505(b)(2) NDA. Vicoprofen, like KP201/APAP, is a product containing hydrocodone. The primary objective of this trial was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of hydrocodone and hydromorphone from KP201/APAP relative to Vicoprofen when administered orally to healthy subjects under fasted conditions. Randomized subjects received a single dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg) and a single dose of Vicoprofen (7.5 mg of hydrocodone / 200 mg of ibuprofen) with the two administrations separated by a seven-day washout period. A total of 30 healthy adult volunteers enrolled in the trial and 28 of the 30 subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that there were no overall differences in exposure to hydrocodone and active metabolite hydromorphone from KP201/APAP as compared to Vicoprofen. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

Comparative Bioavailability of KP201/APAP and Ultracet Trial . This trial, which was conducted in July and August 2014, was intended to assess the relative bioavailability of KP201/APAP compared to Ultracet in order to allow us to reference the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of Ultracet in our 505(b)(2) NDA. Ultracet, like KP201/APAP, is a combination product containing an opioid, in this case tramadol, and APAP. The primary objective of this trial was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of APAP from KP201/APAP relative to Ultracet when administered orally to healthy subjects under fasted conditions. Randomized subjects received a single dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg) and a single dose of Ultracet (37.5 mg of tramadol / 325 mg of APAP) with the two administrations separated by a seven-day washout period. A total of 30 healthy adult volunteers enrolled in the trial and 27 of the 30 subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that there were no overall differences in exposure to APAP from KP201/APAP as compared to Ultracet. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

Abuse Deterrence Clinical Trials and Intranasal Bioavailability Study

&#160;

In 2015, we completed two human abuse liability trials and one intranasal bioavailability study, each of which generated data that we included in our 505(b)(2) NDA submission. We believe the data from these trials and study, together with the data from the tamper-resistant extraction studies we have completed, may allow us to obtain the FDA&#8217;s Category 1, Category 2 and potentially Category 3 abuse-deterrent language in the KP201/APAP product label, if it is approved.

&#160;

KP201.A01 Oral Human Abuse Liability Trial . This trial, which was conducted from August 2014 through January 2015, was intended to compare the pharmacodynamic, or drug likability, effects, exposure levels and safety of KP201/APAP compared to Norco after oral administration at four, eight and twelve tablet dosages. Pharmacodynamics refers to the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the human body and the purpose of a drug likeability analysis is to assess how probable it is that the drug will be attractive to abusers. Randomized subjects received tablets of Norco (7.5 mg hydrocodone bitartrate/325 mg APAP), and an equivalent amount of KP201/APAP. This was a single-center, double-blind, active-and placebo-controlled, crossover trial. A total of 71 opioid-experienced nondependent volunteers enrolled in the trial and 62 of the 71 subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the trial were that KP201/APAP released less hydrocodone as compared to Norco at the two highest doses administered (eight and twelve tablets). At the lowest doses administered, there was no statistical difference in hydrocodone exposure between KP201/APAP and Norco. In addition, there was a numerically lower incidence of adverse events related to hypoxia for KP201/APAP at both the eight and twelve tablet doses as compared to Norco. Drug liking, as measured by peak maximum effect on the Visual Analogue Scale, was similar for KP201/APAP and Norco at each equivalent dose level. The Visual Analogue Scale is a psychometric response scale used to measure the subjective effect of a dose level based on responses from the subject and is commonly used to evaluate drug likability.

&#160;

KP201.A02 Intranasal Human Abuse Liability Trial . This trial, which was conducted from September 2014 through July 2015, was intended to assess the relative drug likability effects, exposure levels and safety of KP201/APAP compared to Norco after crushing and intranasal administration. Randomized subjects received an intranasal or oral dose of Norco (7.5 mg hydrocodone bitartrate/325 mg APAP) and an intranasal or oral dose of KP201/APAP (6.67 mg / 325 mg). This was a single-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, single-dose, two-part, five-way crossover trial. A total of 46 opioid-experienced nondependent volunteers enrolled in the trial and 42 of the 46 subjects completed it. 

&#160;

&#160;

The results of the trial were that, overall, administration of intranasal crushed or oral intact KP201/APAP resulted in statistically similar results for drug liking relative to intranasal crushed or oral intact Norco. We believe this was potentially due to the effects of APAP. An important component of the APAP mechanism involves indirect activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which likely contribute to the analgesia of APAP and some of its other behavioral effects, such as euphoria. While the role of APAP associated with potential drug liking effects has not yet been determined, it appears plausible that APAP may &#8220;mask&#8221; negative drug effects or reduce differences in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as drug liking, between opioid combination products that contain large volumes of APAP. However, intranasal crushed KP201/APAP demonstrated, as compared to intranasal crushed Norco, a lower peak hydrocodone exposure and a decrease in exposure to hydrocodone in the early time points typically associated with an increased safety risk. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

&#160;

KP201.A03 Intranasal Bioavailability Study . This study, which was conducted from May 2015 through July 2015, was intended to measure the amount of hydrocodone released from KP201, when insufflated without APAP, as compared directly to hydrocodone bitartrate. Randomized subjects received an intranasal dose of hydrocodone bitartrate (15 mg) and an intranasal dose of KP201 (13.34 mg). This was a single-center, cross-over pharmacokinetic study. A total of 66 opioid-experienced nondependent volunteers enrolled in the study and 51 of the 66 subjects completed it. 

&#160;

The results of the study were that KP201 demonstrated a statistically significant lowering in peak hydrocodone exposure, a delay in the time to achieve peak exposure and a decrease in total exposure to hydrocodone, especially in the early time points typically associated with increased drug liking and abuse. We do not believe any of the adverse events occurring in the trial were unusual or unexpected following the administration of opioid medication.

Tamper-Resistant Extraction Studies

&#160;

In 2015, we completed three tamper-resistant extraction studies, each of which generated data that we included in our 505(b)(2) NDA submission. We believe the data from these three studies, together with the data from our two human abuse liability trials and one intranasal bioavailability study described above, may allow us to obtain the FDA&#8217;s Category 1, Category 2 and potentially Category 3 abuse-deterrent language in the KP201/APAP product label, if it is approved.

&#160;

KP201.T01 Study . Our KP201.T01 study was designed to evaluate KP201/APAP for the possibility and potential for individuals to extract KP201 from its tablet formulation and convert the extracted KP201 active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, into active hydrocodone, following a protocol that we developed with input from the FDA. The study evaluated how the abuse-deterrent properties of KP201 could be defeated or compromised, as compared to hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP tablets. The results of the study were that efforts to extract and hydrolyze KP201/APAP were less efficient compared to hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP tablets. Under the more than 1,000 conditions tested, KP201/APAP released less hydrocodone compared to the hydrocodone released from the hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP tablets in every case, and in many cases KP201/APAP released only the inactive prodrug, KP201. 

&#160;

KP201.T02 Study . Our KP201.T02 study was designed to evaluate the properties of KP201 that could reduce the likelihood of IV abuse of KP201/APAP as compared to hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP, based on a protocol developed by us with input from the FDA. The study evaluated the amount of KP201, APAP and hydrocodone detected in an extract derived from KP201/APAP tablets that would be suitable for IV abuse. The results of the study were that the traditional means used to prepare a drug for injection were likely not suitable for KP201/APAP. In each condition employed, only inactive KP201 was extracted, if anything at all, while up to 100% of the hydrocodone from hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP tablets could be extracted for injection. Cold water extraction methods typically used by abusers to &#8220;enrich&#8221; or &#8220;purify&#8221; the hydrocodone from hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP also yielded only inactive KP201 with no release of hydrocodone from the prodrug. Hydrocodone was readily extracted from hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP tablets by this method. 

&#160;

KP201.T03 Study . Our KP201.T03 study was designed to evaluate the potential to abuse KP201/APAP by smoking. The results of the study were that KP201/APAP could not be smoked in either tablet or KP201 form. The results also showed that freebasing KP201/APAP was not possible. By contrast, hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP can be prepared as a freebase and also smoked in the API form. 

&#160;

KP201/IR (APAP-free)

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

Our second most advanced product candidate, KP201/IR (APAP-free), is an IR formulation of KP201 without any APAP. We are developing KP201/IR (APAP-free) for the short-term management of acute pain. KP201/IR (APAP-free) is designed to be an abuse-

&#160;

deterrent opioid product that offers comparable efficacy to the existing standard-of-care, IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products, such as Vicodin, Norco and Lortab, but with the potential safety advantage of having no added APAP. 

&#160;

Based on our current development timelines, we anticipate submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2017. We expect that KP201/IR (APAP-free), like other abuse-deterrent opioids, would receive priority review.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

Currently, there are no IR hydrocodone products approved in the United States that are formulated without APAP, with or without an abuse-deterrent label. We believe KP201/IR (APAP-free) will provide physicians with a highly differentiated abuse-deterrent hydrocodone product to help them with the short-term management of acute pain.

&#160;

Key Product Features of KP201/IR (APAP-free)

&#160;

We believe KP201/IR (APAP-free), if approved by the FDA, may have many valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Molecular-based abuse-deterrent technology . Similar to KP201/APAP, KP201/IR (APAP-free) uses our KP201 prodrug which incorporates our LAT platform technology to create its abuse-deterrent properties at the molecular level and thus may provide a higher barrier against attempted abuse than many existing formulation-based approaches. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No added APAP . KP201/IR (APAP-free) contains no acetaminophen. According to the FDA, overdoses of APAP are the most common cause of drug-related liver injury. In 2011, the FDA limited the amount of APAP in prescription combination products and required warnings be added to all APAP prescription products. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Composition-of-matter patent protection . KP201/IR (APAP-free) is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on KP201 that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2031. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No generic equivalent product . Similar to KP201/APAP, the difference in chemical name, prescription strength and lack of APAP in the formulation will mean that there will be no generic equivalent product for KP201/IR (APAP-free) in most states. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Convenient dosing . Based on data from our food-effect clinical trial of KP201/APAP, we believe that KP201/IR (APAP-free) will also be able to be administered under both fed and fasting conditions and, accordingly, we believe that KP201/IR (APAP-free) will be as convenient as existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products. 

&#160;

KP511/ER

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

KP511/ER is our ER formulation of KP511, our prodrug of hydromorphone, which we are developing for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. KP511/ER is designed to be an abuse-deterrent opioid product that offers equivalent efficacy to approved ER hydromorphone products. KP511 combines hydromorphone with one or more ligands and can be formulated in both IR and ER dosage forms. KP511 is designed not to release its hydromorphone component until it is metabolized in the GI tract following oral administration. We believe KP511 is highly tamper-resistant and is stable under conditions that can potentially defeat many formulation-based abuse-deterrent technologies.

&#160;

We plan to seek approval of KP511/ER under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that KP511 may release hydromorphone after oral administration in humans in a manner that is comparable to the appropriate approved hydromorphone drug. We filed an IND for KP511 in March 2016. We anticipate reporting human proof-of-concept data for KP511/ER in 2016 and submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP511/ER in 2018.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

Oral hydromorphone products are typically used for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. IMS estimates that in 2013 there were 3.5 

&#160;

million dispensed prescriptions of hydromorphone in the United States. Currently, there are no hydromorphone products approved in the United States with an abuse-deterrent label. 

&#160;

Key Product Features of KP511/ER

&#160;

Based on our preclinical data, we believe KP511/ER, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society when compared to FDA-approved hydromorphone products:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Molecular-based abuse-deterrent technology . In order to evaluate the abuse-deterrent qualities of KP511, we conducted preclinical studies in rats to compare the exposure to hydromorphone following intranasal and IV administration of KP511 as compared to intranasal and IV administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride. We observed significantly lower concentrations of hydromorphone following intranasal and IV administration of KP511 compared to intranasal and IV administered hydromorphone hydrochloride. KP511/ER incorporates our LAT platform technology to create its abuse-deterrent properties at the molecular level and, based on our preclinical studies, we believe it may have abuse-deterrent characteristics similar to KP201/APAP. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Oral overdose protection . In our preclinical studies, we observed that hydromorphone blood levels in rats increased more slowly and to a lesser extent after oral administration of increasing excessively large doses of KP511, as compared to increasing equimolar oral doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride. We also observed that the study animals began dying from the increasing excessively large oral doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride, but never died from an equimolar oral dose of KP511. Based on the molecular structure of KP511, we believe it is possible that the metabolic processes of releasing hydromorphone from the prodrug become saturated at excessively large oral doses. If confirmed by further studies, this could potentially mean that KP511 and KP511/ER may reduce the risk of oral overdosing by a mechanism that is inherent in the prodrug molecule itself. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Composition-of-matter patent protection . KP511/ER is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on KP511 that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2032. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic market opportunities, and, as of December 31, 2015, a composition-of-matter patent on KP511 was granted in Australia, Japan, Philippines, New Zealand, South Africa, and Singapore, and applications covering KP511 were pending in the United States and an additional 20 foreign jurisdictions. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No generic equivalent product . KP511 is a prodrug that we believe will be given a new chemical name, which would mean that there would be no generic equivalent product for KP511/ER in most states, making substitution difficult at the pharmacy. 

&#160;

KP415

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

KP415 is our prodrug of methylphenidate, which we are developing for the treatment of ADHD. The ADHD market is largely served by the stimulant products methylphenidate and amphetamine. KP415 is designed to be a controlled release, or CR, abuse-deterrent methylphenidate product.

&#160;

We plan to seek approval of KP415 under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. We anticipate reporting human proof-of-concept data for KP415 in 2016 and submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP415 in 2019.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

We believe the ADHD market would be receptive to new branded drugs that have improved properties when compared to current treatments. We believe a new product in the form of a prodrug that has abuse-deterrent features and a more consistent controlled release drug delivery mechanism may provide a preferred treatment option in this large market segment. While methylphenidate is available as a generic product, the branded formulations, Concerta, Focalin and Ritalin, accounted for sales of $1.2 billion in 2015.

&#160;

Key Product Features of KP415

&#160;

Based on our preclinical data, we believe KP415, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and provide significant benefits to patients, physicians, and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely prescribed methylphenidate products:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Molecular-based abuse-deterrent technology . In order to evaluate the abuse-deterrent qualities of KP415, we conducted preclinical studies in rats to compare the exposure to methylphenidate following intranasal and IV administration of KP415 as compared to intranasal and IV administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride. We observed significantly lower concentrations of methylphenidate following intranasal and IV administration of KP415 compared to intranasal and IV administered methylphenidate hydrochloride. KP415 incorporates our LAT platform technology to create its abuse-deterrent properties at the molecular level and, based on our preclinical studies, we believe it will have abuse-deterrent characteristics similar to KP201/APAP. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Once-daily dosing . Pharmacokinetic data from our preclinical studies suggest that the time to maximum plasma concentration of methylphenidate after oral administration of KP415 is approximately three times longer than that after oral administration of currently marketed IR methylphenidate. We believe this inherent CR attribute of KP415&#8217;s molecular structure may allow for convenient, once-daily dosing. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Amenable to patient-friendly formulations . Although we believe our prodrug, KP415, possesses abuse-deterrent properties at the molecular level similar to KP201, our preclinical data shows that KP415 is highly water soluble and we believe it could ultimately be used in a variety of patient-friendly dosage forms such as oral thin film, orally dissolving tablets, chewable tablets and liquids as a means of increasing patient convenience and compliance. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Composition-of-matter patent protection . KP415 is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2032. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic market opportunities, and, as of December 31, 2015, a composition-of-matter patent on KP415 was granted in New Zealand and South Africa, and additional KP415 patent filings were pending in the United States and an additional 23 foreign jurisdictions. In addition, subject to further discussions with the FDA, KP415 may be eligible for new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity status, which could allow for five years of U.S. market exclusivity following the FDA&#8217;s approval of an NDA for KP415. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No generic equivalent product . KP415 is a prodrug that we believe will be given a new chemical name, which would mean that there would be no generic equivalent product for KP415 in most states, making substitution difficult at the pharmacy. 

&#160;

Other Product Candidates

&#160;

We are using our LAT platform technology to develop other product candidates in pain. One example is KP606/IR, an IR formulation of KP606, our prodrug of oxycodone, which we are developing for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. KP606/IR is designed to be an IR abuse-deterrent opioid product that offers equivalent efficacy to OxyContin. KP606 combines oxycodone with one or more ligands.

&#160;

We anticipate reporting human proof-of-concept data for KP606/IR in 2017 and submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP606/IR in 2019.

&#160;

Another example is KP746, our prodrug of oxymorphone, which is currently in preclinical development. We are developing KP746 for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.

&#160;

Our Intellectual Property

&#160;

Our intellectual property strategy includes seeking composition-of-matter patents, among other patents, for our prodrugs and product candidates and conjugates of our prodrugs while also protecting as trade secrets our LAT platform technology, the process by which we identify, screen, evaluate and select ligands to be conjugated with parent drugs to create our prodrugs. Our current prodrugs all consist of an approved parent drug and one or more ligands that we have selected using our LAT platform technology. The parent drug and ligand or ligands together may potentially constitute an NME and thus may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection, among other patent protections, in the United States and abroad.

&#160;

To date, we have internally developed all of our intellectual property, including our LAT platform technology, and have not in-licensed or otherwise acquired our technology, patents, show-how or know-how from an outside source. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 12 issued patents within the United States, and an additional 35 foreign patents covering our prodrugs or product candidates. The terms of the 12 issued U.S. patents extend to various dates between 2030 and 2032. The term of our overall domestic and foreign patent portfolio related to our prodrugs and product candidates, including patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, extend to various dates between 2030 and 2032, if pending patent applications in each of our patent families issue as patents. As of December 31, 2015, we owned eight pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States, and an additional 69 pending foreign patent applications covering our prodrugs and product candidates. Our issued and granted patents 

&#160;

provide protection in jurisdictions that include the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, Singapore, Indonesia and South Africa. 

&#160;

In 2013, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, issued a composition-of-matter patent covering KP201, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2031. Further, there are granted or recently allowed compositions-of-matter patents covering KP201 in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Ukraine, Indonesia and South Africa. In addition, one U.S. patent application covering KP201-related compositions-of-matter were pending as of December 31, 2015, and patent applications covering KP201 were pending as of December 31, 2015, in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Belarus, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Europe, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Oman, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

&#160;

In August 2014, the USPTO issued a composition-of-matter patent covering KP511, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2032. In July 2015, the USPTO issued a composition-of-matter patent covering KP415, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding patent term extensions, in 2032. We have also filed composition-of-matter patent applications for KP415 and KP511 in the United States and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Europe, India, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam and South Africa. We anticipate filing additional patent applications for our prodrug product candidates.

&#160;

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our LAT platform technology as well as any proprietary know-how and show-how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

&#160;

Commercialization

&#160;

We have begun initial pre-approval commercialization activities for KP201/APAP although currently we do not have any internal sales or distribution infrastructure. These initial pre-approval commercialization activities include developing the marketing strategy, designing the product distribution infrastructure, coordinating managed care access and identifying the promotional sales force size and structure. These activities are aligned to support a planned promotional launch of KP201/APAP as early as the first quarter of 2017, subject to FDA approval and DEA scheduling.

&#160;

Because many of our product candidates, including KP201/APAP, may have large potential market opportunities, and may require significant marketing resources, we may conclude that the most appropriate approach to their commercialization, if they receive regulatory approval, will involve forming a commercial collaboration or strategic relationship, or consummating some type of strategic transaction, with a larger pharmaceutical marketing organization. Alternatively, we may conclude that building our own focused sales and marketing organization will be most appropriate, perhaps as part of a co-promotional arrangement, or some other form of collaboration. As we get closer to potential approval of our product candidates, we will work to identify and implement the commercialization strategies that we conclude are the most desirable with regard to the specific product candidates.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

Historically, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $13.9 million, $11.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We plan to increase our research and development expense for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to commercialize, if approved, and further advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. 

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We will face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include their potential degree of abuse deterrence, onset of action, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, convenience of dosing, safety, tolerability and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products 

&#160;

and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop abuse-deterrent or other products for the short-term management of acute pain, or for other indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future, and such competitors&#8217; products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials. 

&#160;

If approved, our abuse-deterrent opioid product candidates will face competition from commercially available branded and generic opioid drugs, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as other marketed non-opioid products for the treatment of pain, and potential competition from opioid and non-opioid products for the treatment of pain that are currently in clinical development. In addition, our product candidates will face competition from approved and abuse-deterrent labeled opioid drugs and potential competition from abuse-deterrent opioid drugs that are currently in clinical development. We may compete with multiple companies that have developed and are developing abuse-deterrent technologies that may be applied to a variety of drugs, including those being developed for the short-term management of acute pain as well as for other indications that we are pursuing or may pursue in the future. If approved, our abuse-deterrent opioid product candidates may face competition from opioid products or abuse-deterrent technologies from companies including Allergan plc, Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Depomed, Inc., DURECT Corporation, Egalet Corporation, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo International plc, Gr&#252;nenthal Group, Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, IntelliPharmaceutics International Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Mylan Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pain Therapeutics, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., Signature Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Trevena Inc. and UCB S.A.

&#160;

If approved, KP201/APAP will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products indicated for the short-term management of acute pain. Some of these currently marketed products include AbbVie&#8217;s Vicodin, Allergan&#8217;s Norco, Shionogi&#8217;s Xodol and UCB Pharma&#8217;s Lortab, in addition to multiple other branded and generic hydrocodone/APAP combination products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Endo International plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP201/APAP will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent IR or other hydrocodone/APAP combination products for the short-term management of acute pain that are currently in or may enter into clinical development.

&#160;

If approved, KP415 will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently marketed products include Johnson &#38; Johnson&#8217;s Concerta, Novartis AG&#8217;s Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Focalin and Focalin XR, UCB S.A.&#8217;s Metadate CD, and Noven Pharmaceuticals&#8217; Daytrana, in addition to multiple other branded and generic methylphenidate products marketed by companies including Allergan plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP415 will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent or other methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.

&#160;

If approved, KP511/ER will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic, IR and ER hydromorphone products approved for use in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Some of these currently marketed products include Purdue Pharma L.P.&#8217;s Dilaudid and Mallinckrodt plc&#8217;s Exalgo, in addition to multiple other branded and generic IR and ER hydromorphone products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Mallinckrodt plc, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals L.P. and Roxanne Laboratories, Inc. In addition, if approved, KP511/ER will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent or other IR and ER hydromorphone products for the treatment of pain that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.

&#160;

If approved, KP606/IR will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic, abuse-deterrent and other IR and ER oxycodone products approved for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate or for use in opioid-tolerant patients for the treatment of acute pain and pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Some of these currently marketed products include Purdue Pharma L.P.&#8217;s OxyContin and Mallinckrodt plc&#8217;s Roxicodone, in addition to multiple other branded and generic, abuse-deterrent and other, IR and ER oxycodone products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Endo International plc, and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP606/IR will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent and other, IR and ER oxycodone products that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.

&#160;

If approved, KP746 will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic oxymorphone products for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. Some of these currently marketed products include Endo International plc&#8217;s Opana ER, in addition to other generic oxymorphone products marketed by companies including CorePharma, LLC, Impax Laboratories Inc., Mallinckrodt Inc., Roxane Laboratories, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. In addition, if approved, KP746 will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent and other IR and ER oxymorphone products that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing

&#160;

Our manufacturing strategy is to rely on contract manufacturers to produce our prodrug product candidates for clinical trials and, if approved, drug product for commercial sale. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on a third-party manufacturer to produce KP201/APAP for our clinical trials and we expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of KP201/APAP if and when we receive approval for marketing from the FDA. We also rely on Johnson Matthey Inc., or JMI, a third-party manufacturer, to produce the bulk quantities of KP201 required for the manufacture of the KP201/APAP used in our clinical trials under a supply agreement. We plan to continue to rely on JMI to manufacture commercial quantities of KP201 used in production of KP201/APAP for sale in the United States if and when we receive approval for marketing by the FDA. We expect to contract with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of KP201 and KP201/APAP outside the United States if and when we receive approval for marketing by regulatory authorities outside the United States.

&#160;

Our current and any future third-party manufacturers, their facilities and all lots of drug substance and drug products used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our current and any future third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.

&#160;

Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonments.

&#160;

Supply Agreement with Johnson Matthey

&#160;

Under our supply agreement with JMI, or the Supply Agreement, JMI has agreed to supply us with all of the KP201 necessary for clinical trials and commercial sale for a price equal to JMI&#8217;s manufacturing cost and to provide process development services for KP201. In exchange, we issued shares of our common stock to JMI, provided that the commercial supply arrangement for KP201 would be exclusive to them in the United States. In addition, for further process optimization and manufacture of NDA registration batches, we agreed to pay a minimum royalty on the net sales on the commercial sale of KP201/APAP, if approved by the FDA. The percentage royalty rate ranges from the high teens at low volumes to the mid-single digits at higher volumes. Under the agreement, JMI has completed manufacture of our registration batches of KP201/APAP and stability testing for those batches is in process.

&#160;

Under the Supply Agreement, we retain sole ownership of KP201 and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to pursue FDA marketing approval of KP201/APAP. We are responsible for product development, including formulation, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and for regulatory approval, quality assurance and commercialization. If KP201 is subject to a DEA scheduling quota, then each quarter, both we and JMI are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a quota from the DEA for the production of the KP201 API and for KP201.

&#160;

We are responsible for all costs of any KP201 manufactured during a specified validation process for KP201. After completion of the validation process, but prior to the commercial launch of KP201, JMI will manufacture batches of KP201 at a price to be negotiated. Failure to agree upon this pricing would result in JMI supplying these batches to us free of charge and we would pay JMI an additional royalty payment on such batches. The percentage royalty rate ranges from the low teens at low volumes to the low single digits at higher volumes and is additive to any minimum royalty we may owe JMI on such batch. After the commercial launch of KP201/APAP, JMI will manufacture and supply KP201 at a price equal to JMI&#8217;s fully allocated manufacturing cost.

&#160;

We must purchase all of our U.S. KP201 needs from JMI and JMI cannot supply KP201 to other companies. After the commercial launch of KP201, JMI is required to identify a secondary manufacturing site and qualify and validate that site for the production of KP201.

&#160;

&#160;

The term of the S upply A greement extends as long as we hold a valid and enforceable patent for KP201 or until the tenth anniversary of KP201&#8217;s commercial launch, whichever date is later. Upon the expiration of such term, the agreement will automatically renew for a period of two years unless either party provides 12 months&#8217; prior notice of its intent not to renew. 

&#160;

Asset Purchase Agreement with Shire LLC

&#160;

In March 2012, as a result of a litigation settlement, we and our chief executive officer, Travis C. Mickle, Ph. D., entered into an asset purchase agreement with Shire LLC, or Shire, pursuant to which we sold assets and intellectual property to Shire for proceeds of $5.1 million. As partial consideration for this sale, we and Dr. Mickle agreed not to compete with Shire in the development, commercialization, production or distribution of amphetamine amino acid conjugate products until March 21, 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, we also granted Shire a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415.

&#160;

Third-Party Reimbursement

&#160;

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governmental authorities, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private insurers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay providers for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. These decisions are influenced by the existence of multiple drug products within a therapeutic class and the net cost to the plan, including the amount of the prescription price, if any, rebated by the drug&#8217;s manufacturer. Typically, generic versions of drugs are placed in a preferred tier. The position of a drug on the formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Additionally, a third-party payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. As a result, coverage, reimbursement and placement determinations are complex and are often the subject of extensive negotiations between the payor and the owner of the drug.

&#160;

Unless we enter into a strategic collaboration under which our collaborator assumes responsibility for seeking coverage and reimbursement for a given product, we will be responsible for negotiating coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for our product candidates. Coverage, reimbursements and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, the clinical need for the new product and the cost-effectiveness of the product. Increasingly, both purchasers and payors are also conducting comparative clinical and cost effectiveness analyses involving application of metrics, including data on patient outcomes, provided by manufacturers.

&#160;

Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, KP201/APAP, KP201/IR (APAP-free), KP415, KP511/ER, KP606/IR and KP746 would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These plans develop formularies that determine which products are covered and what co-pay will apply to covered drugs. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures, negotiating rebates with manufacturers and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products, subject to review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for discriminatory practices. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on, in whole or in part, to each of the plan&#8217;s enrollees through reduced premiums. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the &#8220;donut hole&#8221;, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% in 2020. To help achieve this reduction, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide quarterly discounts of 50% off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the donut hole.

&#160;

If a drug product is available for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid, its manufacturer must comply with various health regulatory requirements and price reporting metrics, which may include, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers with certain drugs covered by Medicaid to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. States may 

&#160;

also negotiate &#8220;supplemental&#8221; Medicaid rebates on drug products dispensed under Medicaid. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also generally required to participate in the Public Health Service 340B Drug Discount Program, which imposes a mandatory discount on purchases by certain customers. Manufacturers of innovator drugs, including 505(b)(2) drugs, that participate in the Medicaid program are also required to offer the drugs on the Federal Supply Schedule purchasing program of the General Services Administration for purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and other authorized users at a mandatory discount. Additional laws and requirements apply to these contracts. Participation in such federal programs may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. 

&#160;

Third-party payors, including the U.S. government, continue to apply downward pressure on the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations may result in lower reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. We expect that these trends will continue as these payors implement various proposals or regulatory policies, including various provisions of the recent health reform legislation that affect reimbursement of these products. There are currently, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement controls on reimbursement and pricing, directly and indirectly.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products.

&#160;

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

nonclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and GCPs; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use. 

&#160;

Prior to the commencement of marketing of controlled substances, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA.

&#160;

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each study site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and other communications to 

&#160;

study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s or the IRB&#8217;s requirements, if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise us to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 

&#160;

In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1 &#8212;Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2 &#8212;Controlled studies are conducted with groups of subjects with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3 &#8212;These clinical trials are undertaken in larger subject populations to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations so long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs. 

&#160;

In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the relevance of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the NDA.

&#160;

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.

&#160;

Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make specified financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Information about some clinical trials, including a description of the trial and trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.

&#160;

The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the 

&#160;

identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

&#160;

505(b)(2) Approval Process

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, or 505(b)(2), provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug for purposes of a 505(b)(2) NDA. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the reference listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.

&#160;

Our current and anticipated product candidates are or will be based on already approved APIs in combination with a ligand. Accordingly, we have and expect to be able to continue to rely on information from studies previously conducted by the companies that obtained approval for drugs containing such APIs.

&#160;

Orange Book Listing

&#160;

Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed &#8220;abbreviated&#8221; because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject&#8217;s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.

&#160;

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA patents whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.

&#160;

Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, or, if permissible, are carved out.

&#160;

If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, 

&#160;

recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor&#8217;s decision to initiate patent litigation. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 

&#160;

We have made a Paragraph IV certification in our 505(b)(2) NDA for KP201/APAP based on our reliance in part on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of Vicoprofen, a product that remains under patent until June 2017. FDA approval of our 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed until June 10, 2017 or later if the patent or application holder files a patent infringement claim against us. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates&#8212;Our NDA for KP201/APAP includes a Paragraph IV certification and, therefore, we have provided notice of this certification to the holders of certain patents and NDAs upon the FDA&#8217;s acceptance of our NDA for review. This notice may result in a delay in the approval of our NDA by the FDA and potential patent infringement lawsuit by the patent or NDA holder&#8221; for additional information regarding the risk associated with the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway and associated patent infringement lawsuits that may delay FDA approval of 505(b)(2) NDAs.

&#160;

Exclusivity

&#160;

The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA&#8217;s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. Applicants may also seek to carve out certain drug labeling that is protected by exclusivity.

&#160;

If a product is not eligible for the NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug&#8217;s approval. As a general matter, three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

&#160;

NDA Submission and Review by the FDA

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application.

&#160;

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. We have agreed with the FDA on a Pediatric Study Plan which outlines the adult, pediatric and nonclinical studies, as well as formulation work, that we plan to conduct and the associated schedule, which is subject to post-approval amendment of the NDA. We have requested a deferral of these efforts.

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety, purity or potency to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA has also previously indicated that our NDA for KP201/APAP raises issues that will likely require advisory committee review. 

&#160;

The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.

&#160;

Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The timeline for the FDA to complete its review of an NDA may differ based on whether the application is a standard review or priority review application. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for an NME and make a decision on the application. For non-NME standard applications, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the submission date to complete its initial review and to make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date and non-NME applications within six months of the submission date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal and the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding the submission.

&#160;

Once the FDA&#8217;s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information or analyses in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.

&#160;

The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product, or impose additional post-marketing requirements, based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.

&#160;

FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings or precautions in the product labeling, including a black box warning. For instance, we expect that at least some of our product candidates would likely be required to carry black box warnings, including warnings regarding tampering, lethality if our oral tablets are prepared for injection and hepatotoxicity. For example, Norco carries a black box warning related to the APAP component and the risk of liver failure or injury. If the FDA requires a black box warning, we would also be subject to specified promotional restrictions, such as the prohibition of reminder advertisements. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In 

&#160;

addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 

&#160;

Post-approval Requirements

&#160;

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences.

&#160;

After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.

&#160;

Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences.

&#160;

The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. We, however, are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling.

&#160;

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.

&#160;

Failure to comply with any of the FDA&#8217;s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.

&#160;

Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

&#160;

The FDA has the authority to require a REMS to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is an NME. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must develop the REMS program, which the FDA reviews and approves. A REMS may be required for a single drug or an entire class of drugs.

&#160;

&#160;

A REMS may be required to include various elements, including, but not limited to, a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug&#8217;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, an implementation system, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under specified circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug&#8217;s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. 

&#160;

Based upon currently approved product REMS programs and class-wide REMS programs, including the class-wide REMS programs for extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics, we believe that most of our product candidates, if approved, may be subject to a REMS. Accordingly, we expect to have to take prescribed measures to ensure the safe use of our products, if they are approved.

&#160;

DEA Regulation

&#160;

Most of our product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as &#8220;controlled substances&#8221; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the DEA&#8217;s implementing regulations, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.

&#160;

The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

the drug has a high potential for abuse; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

the drug has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

abuse of the drug may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. 

&#160;

We expect that most of our product candidates may be listed by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. However, we have requested in our NDA that KP201/APAP be listed as a Schedule III controlled substance based on its differential abuse potential when compared to other Schedule II controlled substances, such as IR hydrocodone combination products. None of the previously approved abuse deterrent formulations of opioids have received Schedule III designation. In 2014, the DEA also rescheduled hydrocodone combination products into Schedule II from Schedule III. If our product candidates are ultimately listed as Schedule II controlled substances, then the importation of APIs for our product candidates, as well as the manufacture, shipping, storage, sales and use of the products, will be subject to a high degree of regulation. In addition to maintaining an importer and/or exporter registration, importers and exporters of controlled substances must obtain a permit for every import of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III, IV and V, as well as every export of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III and IV. For all other drugs in Schedule III, IV and V, importers and exporters must submit an import or export declaration. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Electronic prescriptions may also be permissible depending on the state, so long as the prescription complies with the DEA&#8217;s requirements for electronic prescriptions.

&#160;

Controlled substances classified in Schedule III, IV, and V are also subject to registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and security requirements. For example, Schedule III drug prescriptions must be authorized by a physician and may not be refilled more than six months after the date of the original prescription or more than five times. A prescription for controlled substances classified in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a physician, may be communicated either orally, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacies. Controlled substances that are also classified as narcotics, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and hydromorphone, are also subject to additional DEA requirements, such as manufacturer reporting of the import of narcotic raw material.

&#160;

&#160;

Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. Acquisition and distribution transactions must also be reported for Schedule I and II controlled substances, as well as Schedule III narcotic substances. 

&#160;

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs.

&#160;

In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance or Schedule III narcotic must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because most of our product candidates may be regulated as Schedule II controlled substances, they may be subject to the DEA&#8217;s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA&#8217;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids and stimulants that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II for use in manufacturing of our product candidates. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers&#8217;, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers&#8217;, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.

&#160;

Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.

&#160;

Other Healthcare Regulations

&#160;

Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the CMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including those described below.

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some other healthcare criminal fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to 

&#160;

have violated the statute. The ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 

&#160;

The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.

&#160;

We, and our business activities, are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

&#160;

As a condition of Medicaid payment for prescription drugs, the Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report to CMS their Average Manufacturer Price, which is used to determine rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and, for some multiple source drugs, Medicaid payment rates for the drug, and for drugs paid under Medicare Part B, to also calculate and report their average sales price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate for the drug. Drugs that are approved under a biologics license application, or BLA, or an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, are subject to an additional requirement to calculate and report the manufacturer&#8217;s best price for the drug and inflation penalties which can substantially increase rebate payments. For BLA and NDA drugs, the Veterans Health Care Act requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Department of Veterans Affairs a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, offer the drugs for sale on the Federal Supply Schedule, and charge the government no more than a statutory price referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price, which includes an inflation penalty. A separate law requires manufacturers to pay rebates on these drugs when paid by the Department of Defense under its TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program. Knowingly submitting false pricing information to the government creates potential False Claims Act liability.

&#160;

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of some of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.

&#160;

Additionally, the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, require some manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

&#160;

Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. CMS released the data for the first reporting period on a public website on September 30, 2014.

&#160;

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of 

&#160;

health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160;

Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

&#160;

Enforcement actions can be brought by federal or state governments or as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government. Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.

&#160;

Healthcare Reform Measures

&#160;

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

&#160;

For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed. The ACA has substantially changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. We expect that the ACA will continue to create significant changes in the healthcare industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for specified branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expanded health care fraud and abuse laws, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, imposed an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#8217;s comparative effectiveness research. There have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has on our business. Final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are anticipated in the future and we will continue to assess the ACA&#8217;s impact on us as final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are issued.

&#160;

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

&#160;

Foreign Regulation

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. 

&#160;

The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 26 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

&#160;
