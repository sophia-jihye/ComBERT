 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Our Company &#38; History 

References to the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the &#147;Report&#148;) are references to Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s Entertainment, Inc. (&#147;D&#38;B Entertainment&#148;) and its subsidiaries. 

We are a leading owner and operator of high-volume entertainment and dining venues under the name &#147;Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s&#148;. The core of our concept is to offer our customers the opportunity to &#147;Eat Drink Play and Watch&#148; all in one location. Eat and Drink is offered through a full menu of &#147;Fun American New Gourmet&#148; entr&#233;es and appetizers and a full selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Our Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports and other televised events. Our customer mix skews moderately to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, and we believe we also serve as an attractive venue for families with children and teenagers. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by providing a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting. 

We operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53 week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, which ended on January 31, 2016, February 1, 2015, February 2, 2014, February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012, respectively, each contained 52 weeks except fiscal 2012, which contained 53 weeks. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share amounts. 

We opened our first store in Dallas, Texas in 1982 and since then we have expanded our portfolio nationally to 81 stores across 30 states and Canada as of January 31, 2016, adding ten new stores during fiscal 2015. Comparable store data presented in this Report relates to stores open at least 18 months as of the beginning of each of the relevant fiscal years and excludes information for our franchised store located in Ontario, Canada, which ceased operations on May 31, 2013. Our Farmingdale (Long Island), New York (&#147;Farmingdale&#148;) store, which closed on February 8, 2015, and our Williamsville (Buffalo), New York location, which closed on September 27, 2015, are not included in comparable store data for fiscal 2015. Our store closure in Williamsville, New York was replaced with a new store in Buffalo, New York which opened for business on October 1, 2015, and is included in the ten new store openings. Our average revenues per comparable store were $11,801 in fiscal 2015. Subsequent to January 31, 2016, we opened a location in Rochester, New York on March 7, 2016. 

From 1997 to early 2006, we operated as a public company under the leadership of our founders, David &#147;Dave&#148; Corriveau and James &#147;Buster&#148; Corley. In March 2006, Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s, Inc. (&#147;D&#38;B Inc&#148;) was acquired by Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s Holdings, Inc. (&#147;D&#38;B Holdings&#148;), a holding company controlled by affiliates of Wellspring Capital Partners III, L.P. (&#147;Wellspring&#148;) and HBK Main Street Investors L.P. (&#147;HBK&#148;). In connection with the acquisition of D&#38;B Inc by Wellspring and HBK, D&#38;B Inc&#146;s common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, since 2006, our management team has been led by our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen King. 

On June 1, 2010, D&#38;B Entertainment, a newly-formed Delaware corporation owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners III, L.P. and Oak Hill Capital Management Partners III, L.P. (collectively, the &#147;Oak Hill Funds&#148;) acquired all of the outstanding common stock of D&#38;B Holdings from Wellspring and HBK. In connection therewith, Games Merger Corp., a newly-formed Missouri corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of D&#38;B Entertainment, merged with and into D&#38;B Holdings&#146; wholly owned subsidiary, D&#38;B Inc (with D&#38;B Inc being the surviving corporation in the merger). D&#38;B Entertainment has no material assets or operations other than 100% ownership of the outstanding common stock of D&#38;B Holdings, which owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of D&#38;B Inc, the operating company. 

&#160;

In October 2014, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized share count to 450,000,000 shares of stock, including 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share and to split our common stock 224.9835679 for 1. Unless otherwise noted herein, historic share data has been adjusted to give effect to the stock split. 

In October 2014, we completed our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) of 6,764,705 shares of common stock (including the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; overallotment option to purchase an additional 882,352 shares) at a price of $16.00 per share. 

During fiscal 2015, we completed three follow-on offerings of our common stock. All shares were offered by our selling shareholders and, in each case, included the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; overallotment option. The timing and share activity for each of these offerings is summarized below:

&#160; (1) &#160; We utilized 248,412 treasury shares in partial satisfaction of the shares provided by option exercise in the May 2015 offering. In December 2015, the Oak Hill Funds sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to the public. As of January 31, 2016, the Oak Hill Funds beneficially owned approximately 18% of our outstanding stock and certain members of our Board of Directors and our management beneficially owned approximately 1% of our outstanding stock. The remaining 81% was owned by the public. 

During fiscal 2015, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility that provides a $150,000 term loan facility and a $350,000 revolving credit facility (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;). The proceeds of the Credit Facility were used to refinance in full the balance of a prior credit facility of $430,000 and to pay related interest and expenses. 

At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we were classified as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as defined in the JOBS Act, which provided us certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;Sarbanes-Oxley&#148;), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. However, as of the end of our second quarter of fiscal 2015, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700,000, and as a result, we ceased to be classified as an &#147;emerging growth company.&#148; Consequently, we are required to file this Report as a large accelerated filer. 

Eat Drink Play and Watch - All Under One Roof 

When our founders opened our first location in Dallas, Texas in 1982, they sought to create a brand with a fun, upbeat atmosphere providing interactive entertainment options for adults and families, while serving high-quality food and beverages. Since then we have followed the same principle for each new store and in doing so we believe we have developed a distinctive brand based on our customer value proposition: &#147;Eat Drink Play and Watch.&#148; The interaction between playing games, watching sports, dining and enjoying our full-service bar areas is the defining feature of the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s customer experience, and the layout of each store is designed to 

&#160;

promote crossover between these activities. We believe this combination creates an experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. Our locations are also designed to accommodate private parties, business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. 

Eat 

We seek to distinguish our food menu from other casual dining concepts with our strategy of offering &#147;Fun American New Gourmet&#148; entr&#233;es and appetizers. Our &#147;Fun American New Gourmet&#148; menu is intended to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers and includes classic &#147;American&#148; offerings with a fun twist. We believe we offer high-quality meals, including gourmet pastas, choice-grade steaks, premium sandwiches, decadent desserts and health-conscious entr&#233;e options that compare favorably to those of other higher-end casual dining operators. We believe our broad menu offers something for everyone and captures full meal, snacking and sports-viewing occasions. We plan to introduce new menu items three times per year that we believe reinforce the fun of the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand. Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for 67.4% of our food and beverage revenues and 31.6% of our total revenues during fiscal 2015. 

Drink 

Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, signature cocktails, and premium spirits. We continually strive to innovate our beverage offering, adding new beverages three times per year, including the introduction of fun beverage platforms such as our Glow Kones, Tiki Drinks and Mega Mojitos. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, allowing for multiple sales opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to each of the Eat, Play and Watch aspects of our brand. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for 32.6% of our total food and beverage revenues and 15.2% of our total revenues during fiscal 2015. 

Play 

The games in our Midway are a key aspect of the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s entertainment experience, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brand. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, typically with over 150 redemption and simulation games. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for 53.2% of our total revenues during fiscal 2015. Redemption games, which represented 78.3% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2015, offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores that we have branded WIN!, where customers can redeem the tickets won through play of our redemption games for prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this &#147;opportunity to win&#148; creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Our video and simulation games, many of which can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games commercially available, represented 18.0% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2015. Other traditional amusements represented the remainder of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2015. 

Watch 

Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s. All of our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other televised events. In fiscal 2010, we initiated a program that evolved into &#147;D&#38;B Sports,&#148; which is a more immersive viewing environment that provides customers with an average of 40 televisions, including 100+ inch high definition televisions, to watch televised events and enjoy our full bar and extensive food menu. We believe that we have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience that offers a new reason for customers to visit Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s. Through continued development of the D&#38;B Sports concept in new stores and additional renovations of existing stores, our goal is to build awareness of D&#38;B Sports as &#147;the best place to watch sports&#148; and the &#147;only place to watch the games and play the games.&#148; 

&#160;

Our Company&#146;s Core Strengths 

We believe we benefit from the following strengths: 

Strong, distinctive brand with broad customer appeal . We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience of &#147;Eat Drink Play and Watch&#148; at Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s, supported by our national marketing, has helped us create a widely recognized brand with no direct national competitor that combines all four elements in the same way. In markets where we have stores, over 93% of casual dining customers stated that they are aware of our brand as a dining and entertainment venue. Our customer research shows that our brand appeals to a relatively balanced mix of male and female adults which is moderately skewed to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, as well as families and teenagers. Based on customer survey results, we also believe that the average household income of our customers is in excess of $75, which we believe represents an attractive demographic. 

Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining and full-service beverage offerings, delivered in a highly-energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and food providers to create new games and food items at compelling price points to retain and generate customer traffic and improve the customer experience. Our value proposition is enhanced by what we consider to be innovative marketing initiatives, including our Eat &#38; Play Combo (a promotion that provides a discounted Power Card in combination with select entr&#233;es), Super Charge Power Card offerings (when purchasing or adding value to a Power Card, the customer is given the opportunity to add more chips to the Power Card at a lower cost per chip amount), Half-Price Game Play (every Wednesday, from open to close, we reduce the price of every game in the Midway by one-half), Everyone&#146;s a Winner (a limited-time offer providing a prize to every customer that purchases or adds value to a Power Card in the amount of $10 or more) and free game play promotions to feature the introduction of our new games. Power Cards are magnetic stripe cards that enable a customer to play our games. A customer purchases &#147;chips&#148; that are used to play our games and are loaded to a Power Card at an automated kiosk or by an employee. We believe these initiatives have helped increase customer visits and encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage and entertainment offerings. 

Vibrant, contemporary store design that integrates entertainment and dining. We believe we continue to benefit from enhancements to the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand through our store design and D&#38;B Sports initiatives, which began in fiscal 2011. Our new store design provides a contemporary, engaging atmosphere for our customers that includes clearly differentiated spaces, which are typically sub-branded as Eat at Buster&#146;s, Gamebar, Dave&#146;s Arcade, WIN! and D&#38;B Sports, designed to convey each component of our customer value proposition: &#147;Eat Drink Play and Watch.&#148; These store design changes include a modern approach to the finishes and layout of the store, which we believe encourages participation across each of the store&#146;s elements. The oversized graphics and images throughout the store are intended to communicate our brand personality by being fun, contemporary and larger-than-life. The dining room d&#233;cor includes booth seating and table seating and colorful artwork, often featuring local landmarks. Our WIN! area provides a retail-like environment where customers can redeem their tickets for prizes. All of our new locations opened since the beginning of fiscal 2011 incorporate our new store design. We believe the introduction and continued expansion of our D&#38;B Sports concept, currently incorporated in approximately 70% of our store base, provides an attractive opportunity to market our broader platform to new and existing customers through a year-round calendar of programming and promotions tied to popular sporting events and sport-related activities. The large television screens, comfortable seating, a full menu of food and beverages and artwork often featuring images of local sports teams and sports icons help create what we believe to be an exciting environment for watching sports programming. We have strategically invested over $68,300 since the beginning of fiscal 2011 to introduce D&#38;B Sports and modernize the exteriors, front lobbies, bars, dining areas and the WIN! area of select locations. During fiscal 2015, we 

&#160;

completed the remodel of three stores and added D&#38;B Sports branding to an additional five stores. As of the end of fiscal 2015, approximately 77% of our stores are either new or were remodeled to incorporate our new store design. 

History of margin improvement. We have a proven track record of identifying operational efficiencies and implementing cost saving initiatives and have increased our Adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 830 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2015. We expect our continued focus on operating margins at individual locations and leveraging general and administrative expense and advertising expense will continue to yield incremental margin improvements, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. During fiscal 2015, we completed the rollout of our electronic ticket initiative, which is a paperless distribution system. We leverage our investments in technology, such as our labor scheduling system and our proprietary technology linking games with Power Cards, to increase the overall performance of our stores while also enhancing the customer experience. Our business model has a relatively lower proportion of variable costs versus fixed costs compared to our competitors. We believe this creates operating leverage and gives us the potential to further improve margins and deliver greater earnings from expected future increases in comparable store sales and new store growth. 

Store model generates favorable store economics and strong returns. We believe our store model offering entertainment, food and beverages provides certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, as reflected by our average comparable store revenues of $11,801 and average Store-level EBITDA margins of 31.0% for comparable stores in fiscal 2015. Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs and produced gross margins of 87.4% for fiscal 2015. With approximately 53% of our revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs, which represented only 8.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2015. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our Store-level EBITDA margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve our targeted average year one cash-on-cash returns in excess of 35% and five-year average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 25% for both our large format and small format store openings, however there is no guarantee such results will occur with future store openings. The 27 stores that we have opened since the beginning of 2008 (that have been open for more than 12 months as of January 31, 2016) have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of 45.5%. The 19 stores that opened subsequent to fiscal 2010 have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of 52.1%. 

Commitment to customer satisfaction. We aim to enhance our combination of food, beverage and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. As a result, we have experienced significant improvement in our Guest Satisfaction Survey results since we began the surveys in 2007. In 2015, 83.7% of respondents to our Guest Satisfaction Survey rated us &#147;Top Box&#148; (score of 5 out of a possible 5) in &#147;Overall Experience&#148; and 85.1% of respondents rated us &#147;Top Box&#148; in &#147;Intent to Recommend.&#148; By comparison, in 2007, 44.0% of respondents rated us &#147;Top Box&#148; in &#147;Overall Experience&#148; and 64.8% of respondents rated us &#147;Top Box&#148; in &#147;Intent to Recommend.&#148; We utilize our loyalty program to market directly to members with promotional emails and location-based marketing. Through our loyalty program, we email offers and coupons to members and notify them of new games, food, drinks and local events. In addition, members can earn game play credits based on the dollar amount of qualifying purchases at our stores. We expect that as our loyalty program grows it will be an important method of maintaining customers&#146; connection with our brand and further drive customer satisfaction. 

Experienced management team. We believe we are led by a strong senior management team averaging over 25 years of experience with national brands in all aspects of casual dining and entertainment operations. In 2006, we hired our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen King. From fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2015, under the leadership of Mr. King, Adjusted EBITDA has grown by 205.6%, Adjusted EBITDA margins have increased by approximately 1100 basis points and employee turnover and customer satisfaction metrics have improved 

&#160;

significantly. We believe that our management team&#146;s prior experience in the restaurant and entertainment industries combined with its experience at Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brand. 

Our Growth Strategies 

The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concept is built on the following key components: 

Pursue disciplined new store growth. We will continue to pursue what we believe to be a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we feel we are capable of achieving consistently high store revenues and Store-level EBITDA margins as well as strong cash-on-cash returns. We believe that the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand is currently significantly under-penetrated, as internal studies and third-party research suggests a total store potential in the United States and Canada in excess of 200 stores (including our 82 existing stores). We believe our new store opportunity is split fairly evenly between large format and small format stores. We opened ten stores in fiscal 2015, including the relocation of our Buffalo store to a new site in the same market. We opened eight stores in fiscal 2014. Store openings during the past five fiscal years were primarily financed with available cash and operating cash flows. In 2016 and thereafter, we believe that we can continue opening new stores at an annual growth rate of approximately 10% of our then existing store base. 

Our new store expansion strategy is driven by a site selection process that allows us to evaluate and select the location, size and design of our stores based on consumer research and analysis of operating data from sales in our existing stores. Our site selection process and flexible store design enable us to customize each store with the objective of maximizing return on capital given the characteristics of the market and the location. Our new store large formats are 30,001 to 45,000 square feet in size and our new store small formats span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet, which provides us the flexibility to enter new smaller markets and further penetrate existing markets. These formats also provide us with the ability to strategically choose between building new stores and converting existing space, which can be more cost efficient for certain locations. We are targeting average year one cash-on-cash returns in excess of 35% for both our large format and small format stores. To achieve this return for large format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $8,800 and first year store revenues of approximately $12,200. For small format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $6,800 and average first year store revenues of approximately $8,500. Additionally, we target average year one margins on Store-level EBITDA (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 29%, for both large format and small format stores. 

Grow our comparable store sales. We intend to grow our comparable store sales by seeking to differentiate the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand from other food and entertainment alternatives, through the following strategies: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Provide our customers the latest exciting games. We believe that our Midway games are the core differentiating feature of the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand, and staying current with the latest offerings creates new content and excitement to drive repeat visits and increase length of customer stay. We plan to continue to update approximately 10% of our games each year and seek to buy games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We aim to leverage our investment in games by packaging our new game introductions featuring exclusive game offerings and focusing our marketing spending to promote these events. We also plan to continually elevate the redemption experience in our WIN! area with prizes that we believe customers will find more attractive, which we expect will favorably impact customer visitation and game play. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage D&#38;B Sports. In 2010, we initiated a program to improve our sports-viewing as part of our strategy to enhance our entertainment offering and increase customer traffic and frequency by creating another reason to visit Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s. This initiative evolved into the D&#38;B Sports concept, which has been incorporated into all new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2013 and will continue to be incorporated into all new stores. In the fall of 2013, we launched a national advertising campaign for 

&#160;

&#160; D&#38;B Sports promoting Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s as the &#147;only place to watch the games and play the games.&#148; We intend to continue leveraging our investments in D&#38;B Sports by building awareness of Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s as &#147;the best place to watch sports&#148; through national cable advertising. In addition, we are strategically expanding our year-round sporting and pay-per-view content to drive increased traffic and capture a higher share of the sports-viewing customer base. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Serve food and beverage offerings with broad appeal. Our menu has a variety of items, from hamburgers to steaks to seafood that represent our new &#147;Fun American New Gourmet&#148; strategy. We aim to ensure a pipeline for three new product launches each year, aligning with the timing of our new game launches. This strategy has been well received by our customers as the percentage of customers rating our food quality as &#147;Excellent&#148; was 81.8% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 700 basis points compared to fiscal 2011, and an increase of 4,390 basis points since fiscal 2007. Similarly, the percentage of customers rating our beverage quality as &#147;Excellent&#148; in fiscal 2015 was 84.9%, an increase of 750 basis points compared to fiscal 2011, and an increase of 4,510 basis points since fiscal 2007. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Grow our special events usage. The special events portion of our business represented 10.8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015. We believe our special events business is an important sampling and promotional opportunity for our customers because many customers are experiencing Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s for the first time. We plan to leverage our existing special events sales force and call center to attract new corporate customers. In addition, we introduced online booking for social parties in order to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers and look to expand its functionality over time. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance brand awareness and generate additional visits to our stores through marketing and promotions. We believe offering new items from each of the &#147;Eat Drink Play and Watch&#148; pillars will keep the brand relevant to customers and drive traffic and frequency. We have identified five key promotional periods throughout the year when we feature this &#147;New News&#148; in national advertising. To increase national awareness of our brand, we plan to continue to invest a significant portion of our marketing expenditures in national cable television and radio advertising focused on promoting our capital investments in new games, D&#38;B Sports and new food and beverage offerings. We also have customized local store marketing programs to increase new visits and repeat visits to individual locations. We will continue to utilize our loyalty program and digital efforts to communicate promotional offers directly to our most passionate brand fans, and we are aggressively optimizing our search engine and social marketing efforts. We also leverage our investments in technology across our marketing platform, including in-store marketing initiatives to drive incremental sales throughout the store. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive customer frequency through greater digital and mobile connectivity . We believe that there is a potential to increase customer frequency by enhancing the in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives as well as through implementing enhanced technology. We intend to leverage our growing loyalty database as well as continue to invest in mobile game systems (game applications for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets), second screen sports-watching apps (applications for mobile devices, allowing our customers to enhance their sports-watching experience by, for example, accessing information about the live sporting event being watched or by playing along with the live sporting event) and social games (game applications that allow our customers to play online together, whether competitively or cooperatively) to create customer connections and drive recurring customer visitation. Expand the Dave &#160; &#38; Buster&#146;s brand internationally. We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America, the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We are currently assessing these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy. As such, we have retained the services of a third-party consultant to assist in identifying and prioritizing potential markets for expansion as well as 

&#160;

potential franchise or joint venture partners. Thus far, we have identified our international market priorities and begun the process of identifying potential international partners within select markets. The market priorities were developed based on a specific set of criteria to ensure we expand our brand into the most attractive markets. In October 2015, we signed a seven store franchising agreement for licensed development in six countries in the Middle East, and we are targeting our first international opening outside of Canada in 2017. 

Site Selection 

We believe that the location of stores is critical to our long-term success. In 2012, we made strategic additions to our development team to better align our resources with our new store model and growth strategy. The prior experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. We have also improved our site selection, design and approval process. We devote significant time and resources to strategically analyze each prospective market, trade area and site. We continually identify, evaluate and update our database of potential locations for expansion. We have recently conducted extensive demographic and market analyses to determine the key drivers of successful new store performance. We base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores. 

Our Store Formats 

We have historically operated stores varying in size from 16,000 to 66,000 square feet. In order to optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics, the target size of our future large format stores is expected to be between 30,001 and 45,000 square feet while our small format stores span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet. We may take advantage of local market and economic conditions to open stores that are larger or smaller than these target sizes. 

To facilitate further growth of our brand, we have developed a small store format specifically designed to penetrate less densely populated markets and backfill existing markets. To accomplish this, we have reduced the back-of-house space, and optimized the sales area allocated to billiards and other traditional games in favor of space dedicated to more profitable video and redemption games. We believe that the small store format will maintain the dynamic guest experience that is the foundation of our brand and allow us flexibility in our site selection process. We also believe that the small store format will allow us to take less capital investment risk per store. As a result, we expect these smaller format stores to achieve returns within our target range and enable us to expand into additional markets. We anticipate that approximately half of our new store openings will be large format and half will be small. At January 31, 2016, 13 of our 81 operating stores were the small store format. Our fiscal 2015 new store openings included nine large format stores: Pelham Manor (metro New York City), New York (1st Quarter), Euless (Dallas), Texas (1st Quarter), Woburn (Boston), Massachusetts (2nd Quarter), Edina (Minneapolis), Minnesota (3rd Quarter), Buffalo, New York (3rd Quarter), Friendswood (Houston), Texas (4th Quarter), Glendale (Phoenix), Arizona (4th Quarter), Springfield (Greater DC), Virginia (4th Quarter) and San Antonio, Texas (4th Quarter). We have also opened one small format store in Kentwood (Grand Rapids), Michigan (2nd Quarter). 

Since fiscal 2010, we have completed major remodel projects at 23 locations as of January 31, 2016 (one in fiscal 2011, nine in fiscal 2012, seven in fiscal 2013, three in fiscal 2014, and three in fiscal 2015). Our focus in the remodeling initiative is to introduce D&#38;B Sports and modernize the exteriors, front lobbies, bars, dining areas and WIN! area. We have received positive customer feedback related to the remodel projects completed to date. 

&#160;

Marketing, Advertising and Promotion 

Our corporate marketing department manages all consumer-focused initiatives for the Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s brand. In order to drive sales and expand our customer base, we focus our efforts in three key areas: 

Marketing: national advertising, media, promotions, in-store merchandising, pricing, local and digital marketing programs 

Food and beverage: menu and product development, in-store execution 

Customer insights: research, brand health and tracking 

We spent approximately $29,970 in marketing efforts in fiscal 2015, $29,144 in fiscal 2014, and $27,475 in fiscal 2013. Our annual marketing expenditures include the cost of national television and radio advertising totaling $22,551, $20,553 and $18,621 in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We have improved marketing effectiveness through a number of initiatives. Over the last three years, we: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refined our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; created new advertising campaigns; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invested in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; developed product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; leveraged our loyalty database to engage and motivate customers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invested more in our customer loyalty program to create stronger relationships with consumers; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; defined a consistent brand identity that reflects our quality, heritage and energy. To drive traffic and increase visit frequency and average check size, the bulk of our marketing budget is allocated to our national cable television media. To enhance that effort, we also develop: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; local marketing plans, including radio and out-of-home; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; in-store promotions and point-of purchase materials; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; customer loyalty programs, including promotional and trigger emails; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; digital programs, including social, search, website, mobile and display. We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 

Special Event Marketing 

Our corporate and group sales programs are managed by our sales department, which provides direction, training, and support to the special events managers and their teams within each location. They are supported by a Special Events call center located at our Corporate Office, targeted print and online media plans, as well as promotional incentives at appropriate times during the year. In addition, we have online booking for social parties in order to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 

&#160;

Operations 

Management 

The management of our store base is divided into ten regions, each of which is overseen by a Regional Operations Manager, Regional Operations Director or Regional Vice President (collectively &#147;Regional Management&#148;) who reports to the President and Chief Operating Officer. Our Regional Management oversee six to ten stores each, which we believe enables them to better support the General Managers and achieve sales and profitability targets for each store within their region. In addition, we have one Regional Operations Director whose primary focus is on new store openings. 

Our typical store team consists of a General Manager supported by an average of nine additional management positions. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities from Area Operations Manager through various positions up to the General Manager role. This structure ensures that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each management member handles various departments within the location including responsibility for hourly employees. A typical store employs approximately 140 hourly employees, most of whom work part time. The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of that store, including the hiring, training and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performances. Our stores are generally open seven days a week, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. 

Operational Tools and Programs 

We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. We have developed customized labor scheduling tools designed to assist our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. We perform weekly &#147;test drives&#148; on our games to ensure that our amusement offerings are consistent with Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s standards and are operational. Consolidated reporting tools for key drivers of our business exist for our Regional Management to be able to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues. 

Management Information Systems 

We utilize a number of proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games&#146; functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our store expansion plans. 

Training 

We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide all new team members with complete orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they are able to meet our high standards. All of our new team members are trained by partnering with a certified trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness training. 

We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store where they receive additional training with their General Manager. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs in order to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct semi-annual evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and also receive an update on our business plan. 

&#160;

When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the location to prepare for an intensive two week training program for all team members hired for the new store opening. Part of the training team stays on site during the first week of operation. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important, because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. 

After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 

Recruiting and Retention 

We seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and team members, and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Our store managers all participate in a performance-based incentive program that is based on sales and profit goals. In addition, our salaried and hourly employees are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. 

Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing 

We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products, per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities. 

Foreign Operations 

We own and operate one store outside of the United States, in Toronto, Canada. This store generated revenues of approximately $10,587 USD in fiscal 2015, $10,611 USD in fiscal 2014, and $10,598 USD in fiscal 2013, representing approximately 1.2%, 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. As of January 31, 2016, less than 1.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 

The foreign activities of this store are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations. 

Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality 

We expect seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of the business in the future with higher first and fourth quarter revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays. These quarters will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to the other quarters. 

Suppliers 

The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We have expanded our contacts with amusement merchandise suppliers through the direct import program, a program in which we purchase WIN! merchandise and certain glassware, plateware and furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Federal and state health care mandates 

&#160;

and mandated increases in the minimum wage and other macro-economic pressures could have the repercussion of increasing expenses, as suppliers may be adversely impacted and seek to pass on higher costs to us. 

Competition 

The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers&#146; discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other concepts that are similar to ours. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie delivery. 

Intellectual Property 

We have registered the trademarks Dave &#38; Buster&#146;s &#174; , Power Card &#174; , Eat &#38; Play Combo &#174; , Eat Drink Play &#174; , and Eat Drink Play Watch &#174; , and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradename and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, we employed 12,495 persons, 206 of whom served at our corporate headquarters, 814 of whom served as management personnel and the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. 

None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage, strike or labor dispute. We believe working conditions and compensation packages are competitive with those offered by competitors and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
