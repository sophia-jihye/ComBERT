History and Background 

&#160;

(1) Share Exchange &#160;

On November 30, 2012, the Company (then known as Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation, referred herein below as &#8220;ICE Corp.&#8221;), and One Horizon Group PLC, a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (&#8220;One Horizon UK&#8221;), consummated a share exchange (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;), pursuant to which ICE Corp. acquired One Horizon UK stock from its then existing shareholders in exchange for 17,853,476,138 shares of ICE Corp.&#8217;s common stock. Upon completion of this transaction, the shareholders of One Horizon UK controlled approximately 96% of the outstanding stock of ICE Corp. and One Horizon UK became a subsidiary of ICE Corp. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition, whereby ICE Corp. is the legal acquirer and One Horizon UK is the legal acquiree and accounting acquirer. On December 27, 2012, the Company changed its name to One Horizon Group, Inc.

&#160;

(2) History of ICE Corp before the Share Exchange &#160;

ICE Corp was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1972 as Coratomic, Inc. It changed its name to Biocontrol Technology, Inc. in 1986; BICO, Inc. in 2000; Mobiclear Inc. in 2006; and Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation in 2009.

&#160;

Prior to the Share Exchange, ICE Corp had two operational businesses: Modizo, and Global Integrated Media Limited (GIM). The Modizo business consisted of a celebrity blogging application, while the GIM business consisted of custom publishing, advertising design, brand building, media representation, website design and development and market research programs. These operations had employees and expenses, and generated gross revenue of roughly $205,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. As the GIM and Modizo businesses did not fit within the Company&#8217;s business plan after the Share Exchange, both operational businesses were sold on December 31, 2012 for the return of 70,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock held by the purchaser, which had a fair value of $420,000.

&#160;

On December 18, 2015, we formed a new Latin America company to facilitate our expansion into the region.

&#160;

In August 2015, a Chinese based Satellite operator, KeyIdea, commenced the launch of its mobile Voice over IP solution targeting its VSAT customers in China. We expect this revenue share based co-operation to contribute to our revenues as the rollout of the numerous KeyIdeas earth stations and customer increases in the next few years.

&#160;

In September 2015, a US based operator, Roam Frii, commenced the launch of its mobile Voice over IP solution targeting free Wi-Fi mobile hotspots throughout New York City. We expect this revenue share based co-operation to contribute to our revenues as the rollout of the numerous New York based Wi-Fi solutions increases in the next few years.

&#160;

On November 30, 2015, we were awarded our patent for our bandwidth efficient mobile voice over Internet Protocol (&#34;VoIP&#34;) platform.

&#160;

In the second quarter of 2015 (the first quarter since the commercial launch of Aishuo) the Company recorded approximately $7,000 of revenue. In the three months ending September 30, 2015, the revenue from Aishuo grew to approximately $16,000 for the quarter. In the final quarter of 2015 the revenue had grown to over $30,000 in the quarter. The management expect this trend in revenue growth to continue as the Chinese user base grows.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, Aishuo was released on Apple's iTunes App store with support for mobile In App Purchases and we signed a commercial license with Nanjing Lin Ren Communications, a smartphone manufacturer to pre-install the Aishuo smartphone App on the handsets prior to leaving the factory.

&#160;

In addition to the developments in the rollout of Aishuo smartphone app brand in mainland China, we have commenced our penetration into the Latin American market by signing a Horizon license contract with a regional operator. We consider Latin America a huge and growing market for mobile apps as Latin America growth is forecast to be in line with the global average and is also forecasting very significant VoIP revenues growing to $12.8bn by 2018 according to Vision Gain VoIP Market Forecast ( https://www.visiongain.com/Report/1107/The-Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol-(VoIP)-Market-2013-2018 ).

&#160;

Rapid Growth in Global Mobile Voice over IP Service Market 

&#160;

We aim to deliver our patented smartphone software to the ever expanding mobile Voice over IP (&#8220;mVoIP&#8221;) user. There are over 1.9 billion smartphones now in circulation and, by 2018, we expect the number of users will grow to 2.56 billion, or one-third of all people worldwide (Source: http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694 ) . Each new smartphone represents an opportunity for us to deliver our innovative mobile VoIP, Messaging over IP and Advertising over IP solution in whatever mobile app brand is attractive to the end user throughout the globe. 

&#160;

By partnering with national carriers and delivering our solution as a licensed service to regional mobile operators, we leverage the power of their brand and join them to fight back against already lost revenues, or potential revenue loss, to network bandwidth-intensive Over The Top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) VoIP apps; such as Skype in the USA or Line in Japan and so on.

&#160;

In the past mobile operators relied upon blocking VoIP on their networks but they have realized that this is no longer a viable option. They must embrace innovations in VoIP software, especially on the smartphone, from businesses like ours. Not only can we offer a multi-media, multi-faceted software solution to smartphones, but we are the only company that offers a package that aids the operators in the rollout, expansion, maintenance and upgrade of their mobile network in metro and rural areas to cater for smartphones.

&#160;

From the beginning of the first smartphones in 2008, our software was specifically targeted to be a disruptive technology, which was and has been explicitly designed, and patented, to work on congested wireless Internet connections; the absolute fundamental basis of mobile phones in 2016 and beyond.

&#160;

As more and more smartphones come online, each one places a significantly higher load on the existing cellular infrastructure; as smartphone users now use smartphone to check for emails, surf the Internet, check the weather, read the news, etc. while in the past, all a mobile phone did was calling and Short Messaging (SMS). In order for carriers to keep up with the explosive growth of smartphones and their increased network consumption they are in need of any possible tool to assist them in managing their network and maintaining relevance on the users&#8217; device.

&#160;

We offer operators a mobile VoIP call that has ten (10) times less bandwidth than a standard telephone call over GSM or legacy mobile VoIP solutions such as Session Initiation Protocol (&#8220;SIP&#8221;). This gives operators a higher quality call on busy and legacy networks such as 2G, 3G and congested metro-based 4G using less bandwidth; meaning more bang for their &#8220;spectrum buck&#8221;. We will not replace traditional calls nor prevent the delivery of newer call types such as Voice over LTE (&#8220;VoLTE&#8221;) etc., but we give operators yet another tool in their arsenal to deliver the best quality voice, for the best value, for their diversified customer bases.

Our Technology 

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160;

We have a very detailed knowledge of these wireless data network issues and have invented a totally new solution to successfully deliver a high quality voice call over a wireless Internet connection. Our solution is designed specifically to address such issues as call latency (i.e. delay) and network jitter (i.e. lost data) in a way that achieves a much higher likelihood of a voice packet (i.e. tiny piece of recorded voice) arriving in time and not being lost or delayed. Our awareness of these problems led us to develop a completely new algorithm for sending and receiving (and ordering) voice packets so as to reduce the likelihood of packet loss due to congestion, which we call SmartPacket&#8482;; and to the end user this just means near HD audio at a fraction of the cellular consumption.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

SmartPacket&#8482; Technology 

&#160;

The core of the Horizon solution is our truly innovative, and patented, SmartPacket&#8482; technology. This enables VoIP from only 2 kilobytes/second (kbps) compared to around 8kbps and upwards from other VoIP platforms available today. This industry-leading solution has been developed in-house and is fully compatible with digital telecommunications standards. This technology is capable of interconnecting any phone system over IP - on mobile, fixed and satellite networks. Our SmartPacket&#8482; technology is not based on legacy SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) or RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol). Rather, the Horizon signaling protocol is much simpler and benchmark testing has shown that it consumes significantly less bandwidth for the same audio quality score. Our SmartPacket&#8482; technology is the world&#8217;s most bandwidth efficient IP communication platform designed for mobile communications. The technology optimizes voice flow, delivery and playback and delivers excellent call quality, reduced delays and drops. As a further illustration, the technology is considerably more efficient in the way it handles silence. Traditional VoIP calls send the same amount of data in both directions, regardless of whether or not someone is speaking. SmartPacket&#8482; technology is designed to detect silence and send tiny &#8220;indications of silence&#8221;, rather than the silence itself. This massively reduces the amount of data transmitted, lowers the load on the cellular infrastructure which, in turn, means that more data can get through. This results in higher audio quality and a better user experience.

&#160;

Our Benchmark Testing: Horizon vs G.729 

&#160;

G.729 is a type of audio compression that is typically used throughout the world for mobile VoIP. Our testing has shown that Horizon is up to 10 times more efficient, depending on which one of our voice compression settings is selected by the user.

Proprietary 

&#160;

The Horizon Platform has been developed entirely in-house, patented, and is fully compatible with digital telecommunications standards. It is capable of interconnecting any phone system over IP &#8211; on mobile, fixed and satellite networks.

&#160;

The Horizon Platform was initially developed for the burgeoning smartphone market and the challenging mobile VoIP over satellite market by Abbey Technology to make the best use of the limited wireless bandwidth available and to minimize the amount of data consumed.

&#160;

We further developed the Horizon Platform for the broader telecommunications market on Apple&#8217;s iOS, Google&#8217;s Android and a Windows PC client focusing on the mobile Internet sector. This sector also benefits from our optimized mobile VoIP as it allows voice calls over new and legacy cellular telecom data networks. With the explosive growth in smartphone sales and increased usage of mobile data services, mobile operators face the challenge of dealing with increasingly congested networks, more dropped calls and rising levels of churn. Since the wireless spectrum is a finite resource, it is not always possible, or can be cost prohibitive, to increase network capacity. For these reasons, we believe that the demand for solutions to optimize the use of IP bandwidth will inevitably increase.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

We have developed a mobile application template called &#8220;Horizon Call,&#8221; that enables highly bandwidth-efficient VoIP calls over a smartphone using a 2G/EDGE, 3G, 4G/LTE, WiFi or Satellite connection. Our Horizon Call application is currently available for the iPhone and for Android handsets and we use it to showcase all of our functions, features, our call quality and the level of software innovation that we can brand for our potential clients.

&#160;

Unlike the majority of mobile VoIP applications, Horizon Call creates a white-label business-to-business solution for mobile operators. Telecommunications operators are able to license from us, brand with us and deploy with us a completely new &#8220;white-labeled&#8221; solution so that they can optimize their highly pressurized mobile internet bandwidth and deliver innovation that in turn brings them new smartphone users. The operators decide how to integrate our application within their portfolio, how to offer it commercially and can customize it according to their own branding. Our solution helps them to manage increased traffic volumes while combating the competitive threat to their voice telephony revenues from other mobile VoIP applications by giving its mobile data customers a more efficient mobile VoIP solution that adds value to their mobile data network.

&#160;

We are positioning ourselves as an operator-enabler by licensing our technology to mobile operators in a manner that can be fully customized to the needs of their subscribers. As shown below, operators are able to offer our platform to deliver branded smartphone applications to their existing customers to reduce lost Voice/Text revenue and minimize customer churn. 

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

By offering Horizon Call to their existing customer base, our customers can offer innovative data-based voice and data services that are different from the existing Over The Top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) data applications running on their networks. OTT refers to voice and messaging services that are delivered by a third party to an end user&#8217;s smartphone, leaving the mobile network provider responsible only for transporting internet data packets and not the value-added content. The Horizon Call voice services allow mobile operators&#8217; customers to make VoIP calls under mobile operators&#8217; call plans, thereby allowing mobile operators to capture value-added content, including voice calls, text messaging, voice messaging, group messaging, multimedia messaging, and advertising, that would have otherwise gone to the providers of other OTT services.

&#160;

Horizon Call runs on both smartphone and tablet devices and, as networks become more congested, software services such as Horizon Call become ever more relevant. We believe that although more network capacity will eventually come on stream with 4G/LTE, it, like all other highways, will quickly become congested and this is why we believe that Horizon Call is ideally placed to add value to mobile data networks.

Incumbent mobile operators are suffering a reduction in revenue per user due to the OTT software services on mobile devices. These OTT applications, such as Skype and Line, can negatively impact mobile operators&#8217; traditional revenue streams of voice and SMS (short message service). As shown below, the Horizon Platform positions the Company to enable mobile operators to operate their own OTT solution branded in their image allowing use on all mobile data networks.

&#160;

In addition to delivering new data services to their existing customers, mobile operators can offer their brand of Horizon Call on any other operators&#8217; handsets. Because the Horizon Call application can be installed on the smartphone from the Internet, the potential customer base for the operators&#8217; data application surpasses the customer base that they can reach through traditional mobile phone SIM card distribution. We believe that this service innovation, coupled with the fact that the Horizon Call application can also use existing mobile operator pre-paid credit redemption and distribution services, presents a very compelling service against OTT services.

&#160;

We believe that emerging markets represent a key opportunity for Horizon Call because these are significant markets with high population densities, high penetration of mobile phones, congested mobile cellular networks and high growth in the adoption of smartphones. More than one-quarter of the world&#8217;s population will use smartphones in 2015, and by 2018, over 2.56 billion or one-third of all people worldwide will be smartphone users. Asia-Pacific will account for over half of all smartphone users in 2015, estimated at 951.5 M users. Globally, China is the largest smartphone market with an estimated 574.2 M handsets. These factors will put increased pressure on mobile operators to manage their network availability.

&#160;

In this context, where necessary, we have created our own brand in China, called Aishuo, formed a number of strategic ventures with local partners in regions of various emerging markets to seize upon this opportunity.

&#160;

In 2013 through our subsidiary One Horizon Hong Kong Ltd, we invested $1.5 million for a 75% equity stake in, Horizon Network Technology Co., Ltd (&#8220;HNT&#8221;), while, ZTE Corporation, held a 25% equity stake in HNT. In 2015 ZTE Corporation allowed OHGI to take 100% ownership of HNT by forfeiting their minority shareholding.

Aishuo in China 

&#160;

To address the explosive growth in China, One Horizon is launching an own-brand smartphone VoIP service, called Aishuo. To date, we have over 15 million downloads of the Aishuo smartphone App and have successfully installed servers throughout China. Our Aishuo app interconnects to the WeChat Wallet, AliPay and UnionPay credit card and micro-payments services in China to facilitate payments. We have also uploaded the App to the biggest smartphone App stores in China including Baidu, Tencent and Qihoo. The smart phone app will be able to provide various optimized internet value added services to its mobile subscribers including but not limited to voice and social media services such as text, picture, video and geo-location messaging. These value added services are made possible through the creation of a &#34;Virtual SIM&#34; and One Horizon's proprietary communication software, an industry first. Combined with One Horizon's location aware mobile advertising services, the Aishuo branded smart phone app is expected to drive multiple revenue streams from the supply of its value-added services. The service has attracted over 15 million downloads in its first year of operation and expects to achieve industry average revenues per user (ARPU) for similar social media apps for its subscribers.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Our marketing objective is to become a broadly adopted solution in the regions of the world with large concentrations of smartphone users and high network congestion. We aim at becoming the preferred solution for carriers who wish to deploy branded VoIP solutions that enable them to minimize revenue erosion, reduce churn, increase the effective capacity of their network infrastructure and improve user experience. We employ an integrated multi-channel approach to marketing, whereby we evaluate and focus our efforts on selling through telecommunications companies to enable them to provide the Horizon Platform to their customers. We routinely evaluate our marketing efforts and try to reallocate budgets to identify more effective media mixes.

&#160;

We conduct marketing research to gain consumer insights into brand, product, and service performance, and utilize those findings to improve our messaging and media plans. Market research is also leveraged in the areas of testing, retention marketing, and product marketing to ensure that we bring compelling products and services to market.

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160;

Direct Sales. Our primary sales channel for the products and services of Horizon Platform is the sale of Horizon Platforms to Tier 1 and Tier 2 telecommunications companies to enable them to provide the product and services to their customers. We continue our efforts to develop new customers globally but particularly in Asia and Latin America.

&#160;

Strategic Ventures. In addition to our direct sales channel, we also offer increased sales through our strategic venture channel. In this context, as mentioned above, we are working towards forming a number of strategic ventures in areas where regulatory issues require local representation.

&#160;

Target Markets . The markets for our primary and joint venture channels will have high population density, high penetration of mobile phones, congested mobile cellular networks and high growth in the adoption of smartphones.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s direct competitors for its technology primarily consist of systems integrators that combine various elements of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialers and media gateways. Other dial-back solutions exist but they are not IP-based. Because SIP dialers and media gateways currently are unable to provide a low bandwidth solution, they do not currently compete with the Company&#8217;s technology in those markets in which their high bandwidth needs are unsupported by the existing cellular networks. They do, however, compete in those markets where the cellular networks are accessible by those SIP dialers and gateways.

&#160;

The Company licenses the Horizon Platform to mobile operators, who in turn may offer the application to their end-user subscribers. The Company&#8217;s principal competitors for the mobile operators&#8217; end-users are Skype, Viber, WeChat, and WhatsApp. Having a mobile operator&#8217;s subscriber opt to use the operator&#8217;s (branded) Horizon Call service instead of existing OTT services means that the mobile operator will gain market share of some of the OTT voice and messaging traffic. We are currently unaware of any other companies that seek to license VoIP technology directly to mobile operators.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

One of the Company&#8217;s key competitive advantages is that it is not a threat to mobile operators. Rather, the Company&#8217;s Horizon Platform is a tool that can be used by mobile operators to compete against the OTT provider&#8217;s applications that are running on their networks. Through the Horizon Platform, mobile operators are able to compete directly with OTT services that, by their design, divert voice and messaging services away from mobile operators. The solution is delivered completely and is easy to install and operate. This means that a mobile operator has a turnkey mobile voice and messaging solution to deploy to its customer (i.e., the end-user).

&#160;

The turnkey Horizon software platform and the Horizon SmartPacket&#8482; technology give us a competitive advantage by managing credit, routing, rating, security, performance, billing and monitoring. Horizon SmartPacket&#8482; is the world&#8217;s lowest bandwidth voice compression and transmission protocol and is 100% developed and owned by the Company. Though other software companies can offer part of this solution space, we believe none offers it in such a complete and integrated fashion as we do. We believe it will take a substantial number of years to copy/replicate the Horizon Platform in its entirety, by which time we believe the Horizon Platform will have improved and further distanced itself from potential competition.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our strategy with respect to our intellectual property is to patent our core software concepts wherever possible. The Company&#8217;s current software patent has been approved in the United States and is pending in other jurisdictions around the world. Our patent strategy serves to protects the Horizon Platform and the central processing service of the Horizon Platform.

&#160;

The Company endeavors to protect its internally developed systems and technologies. All of our software is developed &#8220;in-house,&#8221; and then licensed to our customers. We take steps, including by contracts, to ensure that any changes, modifications or additions to the Horizon Platform requested by our customers remain the sole intellectual property of the Company.

&#160;

Research and Development and Software Products 

&#160;

The Company has spent approximately $1.1 million on capitalizable research and development in the fiscal year 2015.

&#160;

During 2015, we expanded our Irish software development team, our QA team and our graphics team with the addition of 5 new employees in our office at the Nexus Innovation Center on the campus of the University of Limerick.

&#160;

Throughout 2015 we continued with our focus on innovation and our research and development teams (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) brought us a brand new call handoff solution. Applying this new call handoff solution, a call that is in progress on Wi-Fi will automatically transfer to 2G/3G/4G when Wi-Fi signal becomes too weak. Vice versa when a call is in progress over 2G/3G/4G and a known Wi-Fi signal is detected, the call will automatically transfer to a stronger signal. Whilst others have partially solved this issue of radio-handoff, the Horizon solution works for all handset types on Android and on Apple's iOS and we believe that this will open up other mobile VoIP opportunities.

&#160;

R&#38;D also delivered the only service in the world with a combo multi-installation App joined to a shared/peer landline or mobile. Using these features, especially for business, an App will ring on multiple devices at the same time not only on a smartphone and tablet but also ring a land line, mobile, and remote office etc. In this case, an end user can choose the most convenient way to answer a call. Whilst our competitors have partially solved this issue of simultaneous ringing with just the App, we have solved this for all phone types and we believe that this will open up other mobile VoIP opportunities for the Company.

&#160;

Our R&#38;D also focused on further enhancing our VoIP technology to detect and tune optimized voice quality on Xiaomi phones. Xiaomi is China's biggest selling smartphone vendor (source: IDC http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prHK25437515). We plan to continue our R&#38;D focus on optimizing our application and service on Xiaomi smartphones given the expansion of the Xiaomi brand in China, India and South East Asia in order to keep the Aishuo App as the top performing retail VoIP service across the other top four brands in China's smartphone marketplace including Samsung, Lenovo, Huawei and Coolpad.

&#160;

Furthermore, the R&#38;D team delivered a brand new mobile VoIP app Voicemail concept and Ringback Tune concept. The new Voicemail solution means that when subscribers rent telephone numbers on Horizon, they will automatically have the facility of a personalized Voicemail service for them when they are busy or out of Internet coverage. Voicemails can be left by the calling party, optimized for efficient delivery and delivered to the App as audio messages. The user does not have to go through the cumbersome steps of dialing into a messaging service, our App delivers the voicemail directly to the App, complete with caller ID of the caller. The new Ringback Tune solution allows the App user to record, usually fun, audio track to be played to the person calling them while their phone is ringing. Ringback is sold on a monthly basis by mobile operators throughout Asia and our new method for doing this in our technology means that further service revenues can be derived by our licensee by offering new and fun features within our mobile Apps.

&#160;

Further and deeper integration with the Google Wallet and Apple In-App Purchase solutions was also carried out by our R&#38;D teams. Both of these payment service solutions were released in the second quarter of 2015 and provided more payment options to our B2B and B2C subscribers. And we continue to research the ever changing realm of on-line payment services for our customers by getting our In App Payment service for iTunes deployed for use in mainland China for Aishuo and our new KeyIdeas and LinRen licensees.

&#160;

R&#38;D also delivered an in app Sticker solution this year. Stickers are small cartoonlike figures used in smartphone text-chat conversations to show emotions. They are hugely popular in Asia and generate significant revenues for those companies that have such services in place. We intend to license the core Sticker service to our operators and also to launch a complete Sticker purchase service in the Aishuo app in China.

&#160;

R&#38;D delivered a brand new concept in mobile advertising called a Gift Center. Our technology can now deliver small gifts of free calls etc. to our loyal users when they invite others to join, use our app on a regular basis etc. Bringing a feeling of loyalty to a smartphone app is key to retaining the customer and reducing churn.
