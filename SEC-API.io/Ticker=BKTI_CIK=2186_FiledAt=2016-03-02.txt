General 

&#160;

RELM Wireless Corporation (&#8220;RELM,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) provides two-way radio communications equipment of high quality and reliability. 

&#160;

In business for 69 years, RELM (NYSE MKT: RWC) designs, manufactures and markets wireless communications products consisting of two-way land mobile radios, repeaters, base stations, and related components and subsystems. Two-way land mobile radios can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way land mobile radios, enabling them to operate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal and reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception. We employ both analog and digital technologies in our products. 

&#160;

Our digital technology is compliant with the Project 25 standard for digital land mobile radio equipment. The Project 25 standard (P-25) is adopted by representatives from the Association of Public Safety Communication Officials-International (&#8220;APCO&#8221;), the National Association of State Technology Directors (&#8220;NASTD&#8221;), the U.S. Federal Government and other public safety user organizations. Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the VHF (136MHz &#8211; 174MHz), UHF (380MHz &#8211; 470MHz, 450MHz &#8211; 520MHz), 700-800 MHz and 900MHz bands. Our P-25 KNG Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 Compliance Assessment Program (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors. Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors. 

&#160;

We offer products under two brand names: BK Radio and RELM. Generally, BK Radio-branded products serve the government and public safety market, while RELM-branded products serve the business and industrial market. 

&#160;

BK Radio-branded products consist of high-specification land-mobile radio equipment for professional radio users primarily in government, public safety and military applications. These products have more extensive features and capabilities than those offered in the RELM line. Our P-25 digital products are marketed under the BK Radio brand, which includes the next-generation KNG product line. 

&#160;

RELM-branded products provide basic yet feature-rich and reliable two-way communications for commercial and industrial concerns, such as hotels, construction firms, schools, and transportation services. Typically, these users are not radio professionals and require easy, fast and affordable communication among a defined group of users. 

&#160;

We believe that we provide superior products and value to a wide array of customers with demanding requirements, including, for example, emergency response, public safety, homeland security and military customers of federal and state government agencies, as well as various commercial enterprises. Our two-way radio products excel in applications with harsh and hazardous conditions. They offer high-specification performance, durability and reliability at a lower cost relative to comparable offerings. 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1997. We are the resulting corporation from the reincorporation merger of our predecessor, Adage, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which reincorporated from Pennsylvania to Nevada effective as of January 30, 1998. Our principal executive offices are located at 7100 Technology Drive, West Melbourne, Florida 32904 and our telephone number is (321) 984-1414.

Significant Events of 2015 

&#160;

In September 2015, the Company received awards under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;DHS&#8221;) Tactical Communications Contract totaling approximately $26.2 million for portable radios, repeaters, accessories and service. The equipment will be deployed by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;) at over 400 airports both inside and outside the continental United States. The awards are for a base term of one-year that commenced on September 28, 2015 with four one-year options. The first option year was partially exercised immediately. Approximately $15.5 million, or almost 60% of the total amount, is specified in delivery orders. No equipment under these awards was shipped during 2015, and consequently no sales revenue was recorded. The precise timing for fulfillment of these orders has not yet been determined as several logistical variables are addressed. Accordingly, the impact to sales revenue in any particular quarter is uncertain. The Company anticipates that shipments will commence during the first quarter of 2016. The exercise, if any, of the remaining option years, which total approximately $10.7 million, is not specified or guaranteed. 

&#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Land mobile radio (&#8220;LMR&#8221;) communications consist of hand-held (portable) and vehicle mounted (mobile) two-way radios commonly used by the public safety sector (e.g., police, fire, and emergency responders), military and commercial business concerns (e.g., corporate disaster recovery, hotels, airports, farms, transportation service providers, and construction firms), and government agencies within the United States and abroad. LMR systems are constructed to meet an organization&#8217;s specific communication needs. The cost of a complete system can vary widely depending on the size and configuration. Likewise, the cost of radio sets can range from under $100 for a basic analog portable, to thousands of dollars for a fully featured P-25 digital unit. Typically, there are no recurring airtime usage charges. Accordingly, LMR usage patterns are considerably different from those for cellular and other wireless communications tools. LMR usage often consists of direct radio-to-radio communications outside of the range of a communication network with one to many members of a group. Also, LMR functions with push-to-talk operation (i.e., no call set-up or dialing a phone number is required). LMR communications often consist of multiple short (5 second) transmissions between multiple members of a group. For the public safety sector, this is known as Mission Critical Voice (&#8220;MCV&#8221;). The average useful life of a unit can vary, depending upon the application in which the unit is deployed and its handling. 

&#160;

LMR systems are the most widely-used and longest-used form of wireless dispatch communications in the United States, having been first placed in service in 1921. LMR was initially used almost exclusively by law enforcement, and all radio communications were transmitted in an analog format. Analog transmissions typically consist of a voice or other signal modulated directly onto a continuous radio carrier wave. Over time, advances in technology decreased the cost of LMR products and increased their popularity and usage by businesses and other agencies. Responding to the growing usage, additional radio frequency spectrum was allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) for LMR use. 

&#160;

More recently the LMR industry has been characterized by slow growth, reflecting several factors: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

LMR is a mature industry, having been in existence for over 90 years; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

some LMR users are in mature industry segments that have experienced slow growth rates; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

funding and budgets for government and public safety agencies have been constrained; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

limited availability of radio frequency spectrum, which hinders existing users in expanding their systems and potential new users from establishing new systems. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Years ago, as a result of the limited spectrum availability, the FCC mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient. This effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. Responding to the mandate, the APCO, the NASTD, the U.S. Federal Government and the Telecommunications Industry Association (&#8220;TIA&#8221;), in concert with several LMR manufacturers, including RELM, recommended a standard for digital LMR devices that would meet the FCC spectrum-efficiency requirements and provide solutions to several problems experienced primarily by public safety users. The standard is called Project 25. The primary objectives of Project 25 are to: (i) allow effective and reliable communication among users of compliant equipment, regardless of its manufacturer, known as interoperability, (ii) maximize radio spectrum efficiency, and (iii) promote competition among LMR providers through an open system architecture. 

&#160;

Although the FCC does not require public safety agencies or any radio users to purchase P-25 equipment or otherwise adopt the standard, compliance with the standard is a primary consideration for government and public safety purchasers. Users of nationally available 700 MHz frequencies designed for interoperability are required to use P-25 equipment. In addition, U.S. Federal Government grant programs that provide assistance in funding for state and local agencies to purchase interoperable communication equipment for first responders strongly encourage compliance to P-25 standards. Accordingly, although funding for LMR purchases by many government agencies is limited, we believe that as users upgrade equipment to achieve interoperability and comply with FCC narrow-banding mandates, demand for P-25 equipment will continue to grow. Additionally, the P-25 standard has also been widely adopted in other countries. The migration to P-25 equipment is primarily limited to government and public safety agencies. Radio users in the business and industrial market utilize alternative digital technologies (e.g., Digital Mobile Radio) and analog LMR products. 

&#160;

Presently, the market is dominated by one supplier, Motorola Solutions, Inc. However, the open architecture of the P-25 standard is designed to eliminate the ability of one or more suppliers to lock out competitors. Formerly, because of proprietary characteristics incorporated in many LMR systems, a customer was effectively precluded from purchasing additional LMR products from a supplier other than the initial supplier of the system. Additionally, the system infrastructure technology was prohibitive for smaller suppliers to develop and implement. P-25 provides an environment in which users will increasingly have a wider selection of LMR suppliers, including smaller suppliers such as RELM. 

&#160;

Description of Products and P-25 CAP Compliance 

&#160;

We design, manufacture, and market wireless communications equipment consisting of two-way land mobile radios, repeaters, base stations, and related components and subsystems. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. Two-way land mobile radios can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way land mobile radios, enabling them to communicate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal, reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception. 

&#160;

We employ both analog and digital technologies in our products. Our digital products are compliant with P-25 specifications. Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the VHF (136MHz &#8211; 174MHz), UHF (380MHz &#8211; 470MHz, 450MHz &#8211; 520MHz) and 700-800 MHz bands. 

&#160;

Our P-25 KNG Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 CAP as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors. Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors. 

&#160;

The P-25 CAP is a voluntary program that allows land mobile radio equipment suppliers to formally demonstrate their products&#8217; compliance with P-25 requirements. The purpose of the program is to provide federal, state and local emergency response agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing satisfies P-25 standards for performance, conformance, and interoperability. The program is a result of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress to improve communication interoperability for first responders and is a partnership of the DHS&#8217; Command, Control and Interoperability Division, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, radio equipment manufacturers, and the emergency response community.

Description of Markets 

&#160;

Government and Public Safety Market 

&#160;

The government and public safety market includes the military, fire, rescue, law enforcement, homeland security and emergency responder personnel. In most instances, BK Radio-branded products serve this market and are sold either directly to end-users, or through two-way communications dealers. Government and public safety sales represented approximately 90%, 95% and 94% of our total sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

Government and public safety users currently use products that employ either P-25 digital or analog technology. However, public safety users in federal, state and local government agencies and certain other countries are migrating to digital P-25 products. The evolution of the standard and compliant digital products is explained in the Industry Overview section at the beginning of this report. 

&#160;

Business and Industrial Market 

&#160;

This market includes enterprises of all sizes that require fast and affordable, push-to-talk communication among a discrete group of users such as corporate disaster recovery, hotels, construction firms, schools, and transportation service providers. Users in this market continue to predominantly utilize analog products. We offer products to this market under the RELM brand name. Our sales in this market may be direct to end-users or to dealers and distributors who then resell the products. Our sales to this market represented approximately 10%, 5% and 6% of our total sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

Engineering, Research and Development 

&#160;

Our engineering and product development activities are conducted by a team of 26 employees combined with contract engineering resources. Their primary development focus has been the design of our line of next generation P-25 digital products, the KNG Series, and related capabilities. The first models in the KNG line were introduced in 2008 and are included on our primary federal contract vehicles. Subsequently, we added UHF and 700/800MHz products, as well as P-25 Phase I FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) trunking and P-25 Phase II TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) trunking. Our P-25 products also provide encrypted operation, GPS location services and network authentication services. 

&#160;

A segment of our engineering team is responsible for product specifications based on customer requirements and supervising quality assurance activities. They also have primary responsibility for applied engineering, production engineering and the specification compliance of contract manufacturers. 

&#160;

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, our engineering and development expenses were approximately $3.6 million, $3.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We presently have no United States patents in force. We hold several trademarks related to the names &#8220;RELM&#8221; and &#8220;BK Radio&#8221; and certain product names. We also rely on trade secret laws and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

&#160;

Our manufacturing strategy is to utilize the highest quality and most cost effective resources available for every aspect of our manufacturing. Consistent with that strategy, for many years we have successfully utilized outside contract arrangements for different segments of our manufacturing operations. These arrangements, some of which are with offshore concerns, have been managed and updated to meet our present requirements, and they continue to be instrumental in controlling our product costs, allowing us to be competitive and manage our gross margins. 

&#160;

Contract manufacturers produce various subassemblies and products on our behalf. Generally, the contract manufacturers procure raw materials from RELM-approved sources and complete manufacturing activities in accordance with our specifications. Manufacturing agreements and purchase orders govern the business relationship with the contract manufacturers. These agreements and purchase orders have various terms and conditions and may be renewed or modified upon agreement by both parties. Their scope may also be expanded to include new products in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We plan to continue utilizing contract manufacturing where it furthers our business objectives. This strategy allows us to focus on our core technological competencies of product design and development, and to reduce the substantial capital investment required to manufacture our products. We also believe that our use of experienced, high-volume manufacturers will provide greater manufacturing specialization and expertise, higher levels of flexibility and responsiveness, and faster delivery of product, all of which contribute toward product cost control. To ensure that products manufactured by others meet our quality standards, our production and engineering team works closely with our ISO 9002 industry-qualified contract manufacturers in all key aspects of the production process. We establish product specifications, select the components and, in some cases, the suppliers. We retain all document control. We also work with our contract manufacturers to improve process control and product design, and conduct periodic on-site inspections. 

&#160;

We rely upon a limited number of both domestic and foreign suppliers for several key products and components. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. In addition, certain components are obtained from single sources. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, our operations were not materially impaired due to delays from single source suppliers. However, the absence of a single-source component could potentially delay the manufacture of finished products. We manage the risk of such delays by securing secondary sources where possible and redesigning products in response to component shortages or obsolescence. We strive to maintain strong relationships with all our suppliers. We anticipate that the current relationships, or others that are comparable, will be available to us in the future. 

&#160;

Seasonal Impact 

&#160;

We experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year budgets and appropriations. We also experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to our concentration of sales to federal and state agencies that participate in wildland fire-suppression efforts, which are typically the greatest during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened. In some years, these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year. Such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial results. 

&#160;

Significant Customers 

&#160;

Sales to the United States Government represented approximately 36%, 40% and 34% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These sales were primarily to various government agencies, including those within the United States Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;), the United States Forest Service (&#8220;USFS&#8221;) and the United States Department of the Interior (&#8220;DOI&#8221;). 

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

Our backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately $20.3 million and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase is attributed primarily to a previously announced order from the Department of Homeland Security. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with other domestic and foreign companies primarily in the North American market, but also internationally. One dominant competitor, Motorola Solutions, Inc., is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. We compete by capitalizing on our advantages and strengths, which include price, product quality, and customer responsiveness. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to various international, U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Any finding that we have been or are in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business and could also have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In connection with our U.S. government contracts, we are subject to the U.S. federal government procurement regulations that may provide the buyer with the right to audit and review our performance, as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our business is subject to government regulation based on the products we sell that may be subject to government requirements, such as obtaining an export license or end-user certificate from the buyer, in certain circumstances. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, or if we are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations governing the products we sell under our government contracts, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. federal government agencies. 

&#160;

Our products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way land mobile radios, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new land mobile radio equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses. 

&#160;

As a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed (NYSE MKT). 

&#160;

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2015, compliance with these U.S. federal, state and local, and international laws did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 107 full-time employees, most of whom are located at our West Melbourne, Florida facility; 52 of these employees are engaged in direct manufacturing or manufacturing support, 26 in engineering, 18 in sales and marketing, and 11 in headquarters, accounting and human resources activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, nor has there ever been a labor-related work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
