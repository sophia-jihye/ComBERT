&#160; 

The functional currency of the Company&#8217;s operating foreign subsidiaries is the Renminbi (&#8220;RMB&#8221;), which had an average exchange rate of $0.16281 and $0.16066 during fiscal year 2014 and 2015, respectively. The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221; or $&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

&#160; 

We are incorporated in Nevada. From November 1993 through August 2006, we were engaged in the business of owning, leasing and operating coin and debit card pay-per copy photocopy machines, fax machines, microfilm reader-printers and accessory equipment under the name &#8220;Diversifax, Inc.&#8221;. Due to the increased use of internet services, demand for our services declined sharply, and in August 2006, our Board of Directors decided to discontinue our operations. 

&#160;

Upper Class Group Limited, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in July 2006, acquired all the outstanding stock of Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited ("SCHC"), a company incorporated in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, the People's Republic of China (the &#8220;PRC&#8221;), in May 2005. At the time of the acquisition, members of the family of Mr. Ming Yang, our president and former chief executive officer, owned approximately 63.20% of the outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited. Since the ownership of Upper Class Group Limited and SCHC was then substantially the same, the acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Upper Class Group Limited recognized the assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On December 12, 2006, our Company, then known as Diversifax, Inc., a public "shell" company, acquired Upper Class Group Limited and SCHC. Under the terms of the agreement, the stockholders of Upper Class Group Limited received 13,250,000 (restated for the 2-for-1 stock split in 2007 and the 1-for-4 stock split in 2009) shares of voting common stock of Gulf Resources, Inc. in exchange for all outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited. Members of the Yang family received approximately 62% of our common stock as a result of the acquisition. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the share exchange is considered to be a capital transaction rather than a business combination. That is, the share exchange is equivalent to the issuance of stock by Upper Class Group Limited for the net assets of Gulf Resources, Inc., accompanied by a recapitalization, and is accounted for as a change in capital structure. Accordingly, the accounting for the share exchange is identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except no goodwill is recorded. Under reverse takeover accounting, the post reverse acquisition comparative historical financial statements of the legal acquirer, Gulf Resources, Inc., are those of the legal acquiree, Upper Class Group Limited. Share and per share amounts stated have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the share exchange. On February 20, 2007, we changed our corporate name to Gulf Resources, Inc. 

On February 5, 2007, we acquired Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry Co., Limited ("SYCI"), a company incorporated in the People's Republic of China, in October 2000. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the stockholders of SYCI received a total of 8,094,059 (restated for the 2-for-1 stock split in 2007 and the 1-for-4 stock split in 2009) shares of common stock of Gulf Resources, Inc. in exchange for all outstanding shares of SYCI's common stock. Simultaneously with the completion of the acquisition, a dividend of $2,550,000 was paid to the former stockholders of SYCI. At the time of the acquisition, approximately 49.1% of the outstanding shares of SYCI were owned by Ms. Yu, Mr. Yang&#8217;s wife, and the remaining 50.9% of the outstanding shares of SYCI were owned by SCHC, all of whose outstanding shares were owned by Mr. Yang and his wife. Since the ownership of Gulf Resources, Inc. and SYCI are substantially the same, the acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Gulf Resources, Inc. recognized the assets and liabilities of SYCI at their carrying amounts. Share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the acquisition. 

To satisfy certain ministerial requirements necessary to confirm certain government approvals required in connection with the acquisition of SCHC by Upper Class Group Limited, all of the equity interest of SCHC were transferred to a newly formed Hong Kong corporation named Hong Kong Jiaxing Industrial Limited (&#8220;Hong Kong Jiaxing&#8221;) all of the outstanding shares of which are owned by Upper Class Group Limited. The transfer of all of the equity interest of SCHC to Hong Kong Jiaxing received approval from the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce on December 10, 2007. 

&#160;

As a result of the transactions described above, our corporate structure is linear. That is Gulf Resources owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Jiaxing, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of SCHC, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of SYCI. Further, as a result of our acquisitions of SCHC and SYCI, our historical financial statements, as contained in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis, appearing elsewhere in the report, reflect the accounts of SCHC and SYCI. 

&#160;

On October 12, 2009, we completed a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of our common stock, such that for each four shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split. All shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split figures. On October 27, 2009, our shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;GFRE&#8221; and on June 30, 2011 we changed our ticker symbol to &#8220;GURE&#8221; to better reflect our corporate name. 

On January 12, 2015, the Company and SCHC entered into an Equity Interest Transfer Agreement with Shouguang City Rongyuan Chemical Co., Ltd ("SCRC") pursuant to which SCHC agreed to acquire SCRC and all rights, title and interest in and to all assets owned by SCRC, a leading manufacturer of materials for human and animal antibiotics in China and other parts of Asia. 

On February 4, 2015 the Company closed the transactions contemplated by the agreement between the Company, SCHC and SCRC. 

On the Closing Date, the Company issued 7,268,011shares of its common stock, par value $0.0005 per share (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;), at the closing market price of $1.84 per Share on the closing date to the four former equity owners of SCRC .The issuance of the Shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a lock-up agreement with the four former equity owners of SCRC. In accordance with the terms of the lock-up agreement, the shareholders have agreed not to sell or transfer the Shares for five years from the date the stock certificates evidencing the Shares are issued. 

The sellers of SCRC agreed as part of the purchase price to accept the Shares, based on a valuation of $2.00, which was a 73% premium to the price on the day the agreement was reached. For accounting purposes, the Shares are now being valued at $1.84, which was the closing price of our stock on the closing date of the agreement. The price difference between the original $2.00 and the current $1.84 is solely for accounting purposes. There has been no change in the number of shares issued. 

On November 24, 2015, Gulf Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation consummated a merger with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gulf Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now a Nevada corporation. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On December 15, 2015, the Company registered a new subsidiary in the Sichuan Province of the PRC named Daying County Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited (&#8220;DCHC&#8221;) with registered Capital of RMB50,000,000, and there is no capital contributed yet until now. DCHC was established to further explore and develop natural gas and brine resources (including bromine and crude salt) in China. And the business has not commenced yet. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our current corporate structure chart is set forth in the following diagram: 

&#160;

&#160;

Our executive offices are located in China at Level 11,Vegetable Building, Industrial Park of the East in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, P.R.C. Our telephone number is +86 (536) 5670008. Our website address is www.gulfresourcesinc.com. The information contained on or accessed through our website is not intended to constitute and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Form 10-K. 

Business Acquisitions 

On January 12, 2015, the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, SCHC signed an equity interest transfer agreement with the four individual shareholders of SCRC. Consideration for this transaction consists of $66.2 million in cash and the issuance of shares of approximately 7.27 million shares of common stock at a price of $2.00 per share, which represents a 73% premium over our 10 day stock price prior to closing, bringing the total consideration for the purchase of SCRC to $80.8 million. The shareholders of SCRC have guaranteed that SCRC&#8217;s audited 2014 net income will not be less than approximately $11.4 million, otherwise the purchase price shall be proportionally adjusted. 

&#160; 

Leased Facility 

On November 5, 2010, SCHC entered into a lease (the &#8220;Lease Contract&#8221;) with State-Operated Shouguang Qingshuibo Farm (the &#8220;Lessor&#8221;). Pursuant to the Lease Contract, SCHC shall lease certain property with an area of 3,192 square meters and buildings adjacent to the Company&#8217;s Factory No. 1. There are currently non-operating bromine production facilities on the property which have not been in production for more than 12 months. The annual lease payment for the property is RMB5 million, approximately US$755,000, per year and shall be paid by SCHC no later than June 30th of each year. The term of the Lease Contract is for twenty years commencing from January 1, 2011. The Lease Contract may be renewed by SCHC for an additional twenty-year period on the same terms. The Lessor has agreed to permit SCHC to reconstruct and renovate the existing bromine production facilities on the property. 

Our Business Segments 

Our business operations are conducted in three segments, bromine, crude salt, and chemical products. We manufacture and trade bromine and crude salt, and manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration, oil and gas distribution, oil field drilling, papermaking chemical agents, inorganic chemicals and human and animal antibiotics. We conduct all of our operations in China. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Bromine and Crude Salt 

We manufacture and distribute bromine through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited, or SCHC. Bromine (Br2) is a halogen element and it is a red volatile liquid at standard room temperature which has reactivity between chlorine and iodine. Elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture. Bromine is also used to form intermediates in organic synthesis, in which it is somewhat preferable over iodine due to its lower cost. Our bromine is commonly used in brominated flame retardants, fumigants, water purification compounds, dyes, medicines and disinfectants. 

&#160; 

The extraction of bromine in the Shandong Province is limited by the Provincial Government to licensed operations. We hold one such license. As part of our business strategy, it is our plan to continue acquiring smaller scaled and unlicensed producers and to use our bromine to expand our downstream chemical operations. 

&#160; 

Location of Production Sites 

&#160; 

Our production sites are located in the Shandong Province in northeastern China. The productive formation (otherwise referred to as the &#8220;working region&#8221;), extends from latitude N 36&#176;56&#8217; to N 37&#176;20&#8217; and from longitude E 118&#176;38&#8217; to E 119&#176;14&#8217;, in the north region of Shouguang city, from the Xiaoqing River of Shouguang city to the west of the Dan River, bordering on Hanting District in the east, from the main channel of &#8220;Leading the Yellow River to Supply Qingdao City Project&#8221; in the south to the coastline in the north. The territory is classified as coastal alluvial &#8211; marine plain with an average height two to seven meters above the sea level. The terrain is relatively flat. 

&#160; 

Geological background of this region 

&#160; 

The Shandong Province working region is located to the east of Lubei Plain and on the south bank of Bohai Laizhou Bay. The geotectonic location bestrides on the North China Platte (I) and north three-level structure units, from west to east including individually the North China Depression, Luxi Plate, and Jiaobei Plate. Meanwhile, 4 V-level structure units including the Dongying Sag of Dongying Depression (IV) of North China Depression, the Buried Lifting Area of Guangrao, Niutou sag and Buried Lifting Area of Shuanghe and are all on two V-level structure units including Xiaying Buried Lifting Area of Weifang Depression (IV) of Luxi Plate and Chuangyi Sag, as well as on a V-level structure units of Jiaobei Buried Lifting Area of Jiaobei Plate. 

Processing of Bromine 

Natural brine is a complicated salt-water system, containing many ionic compositions in which different ions have close interdependent relationships and which can be reunited to form many dissolved soluble salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium sulfate, potassium sulfate and other similar soluble salts. The goal of natural brine processing is to separate and precipitate the soluble salts or ions away from the water. Due to the differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of brine samples, the processing methods are varied, and can result in inconsistency of processing and varied technical performance for the different useful components from the natural brine. 

Bromine is the first component extracted during the processing of natural brine. In natural brine, the bromine exists in the form of bromine sodium and bromine magnesium and other soluble salts. 

The bromine production process is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. 

natural brine is pumped from underground through extraction wells by subaqueous pumps; 

&#160; 

&#160; 2. 

the natural brine then passes through transmission pipelines to storage reservoirs; 

&#160; 

&#160; 3. 

the natural brine is sent to the bromine refining plant where bromine is extracted from the natural brine. In neutral or acidic water, the bromine ion is easily oxidized by adding the oxidative of chlorine, which generates the single bromine away from the brine. Thereafter the extracted single bromine is blown out by forced air, then absorbed by sulfur dioxide or soda by adding acid, chlorine and sulfur. Extracted bromine is stored in containers of different sizes; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 4. 

the wastewater from this refining process is then transported by pipeline to brine pans. 

&#160; 

Our production feeds include (i) natural brine; (ii) vitriol; (iii) chlorine; (iv) sulfur; and (v) coal. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Crude Salt 

&#160; 

We also produce crude salt, which is produced from the evaporation of the wastewater after our bromine production process. Once the brine is returned to the surface and the bromine is removed, the remaining brine is pumped to on-site containing pools and then exposed to natural sunshine. This causes the water to evaporate from the brine, resulting in salt being left over afterwards. Crude salt is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical, food and beverage, and other industries. 

Chemical Products 

We produce chemical products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry Company Limited, or SYCI and Shouguang City Rongyuan Chemical Co, Ltd (PRC), or SCRC. The products we produce and the markets in which they are sold include, among others:

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We have an in-house sales staff of 19 persons. Our customers send their orders to us first. Our in-house sales staff then attempts to satisfy these orders based on our actual production schedules and inventories on hand. Many of our customers have a long term relationship with us. We expect this to continue due to stable demand for mineral products, however, these relationship can not be guaranteed in the future. 

&#160; 

Principal Customers 

&#160; 

We sell a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of PRC customers. Our principal customers during 2015 were Shandong Morui Chemical Company Limited, Shandong Brother Technology Limited, Kuerle Xingdong Trading Limited, Shouguang Weidong Chemical Company Limited and qinghe production plant of Sinopec Shengli oilfield branch. We have ongoing policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers who are credit-worthy. We are not aware of any allowances for doubtful debts required for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to our three largest bromine customers, based on net revenue from such customers, aggregated $19,540,851 and $19,919,942, respectively, or approximately 37% and 34.4% of total net revenue from sale of bromine; and sales to our largest customer represented approximately 15% and 14.7%, respectively, of total net revenue from the sale of bromine. 

During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to our three largest crude salt customers, based on net revenue from such customers, aggregated $9,080,707 and $9,171,621, respectively, or approximately 87% and 85.3% of total net revenue from sale of crude salt; and sales to our largest customer represented approximately 37% and 37.8%, respectively, of total net revenue from the sale of crude salt. 

During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to our three largest chemical products customers, based on net revenue from such customers, aggregated $22,613,400 and $20,649,995, respectively, or approximately 23% and 45.9% of total net revenue from sale of chemical products; and sales to our largest customer represented approximately 10% and 20.7%, respectively, of total net revenue from the sale of chemical products. 

&#160; 

This concentration of customers for all three segments makes us vulnerable to an adverse near-term impact, should one or more of these relationships be terminated. 

Principal Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our principal external suppliers are Shandong Xinlong Biological Technology Company limited, Shouguang City Rongguang Trading Company Limited and Shandong Xinlong Group Company limited, Shouguang Hongye Trading Company Limited and Shandong Tianling Fine Chemical co., LTD. 

&#160; 

During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we purchased 58.2% and 62.1%, respectively, of raw materials for our bromine and crude production from three suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we purchased 71% and 92%, respectively, of raw materials for our chemical products production from three suppliers. We purchased a portion of the bromine produced by the Company internally as well, at cost totaling $8,039,156 and $3,013,295, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively, for the production of chemical products. 

&#160; 

This supplier concentration makes us vulnerable to a near-term adverse impact, should the relationships be terminated.

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Expansion of Production Capacity to Meet Demand 

&#160; 

&#9660; Bromine and Crude Salt 

&#160; 

&#160; In view of keen competition and the trend of less bromine contraction of brine water being extracted in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, the Company had announced its intent to access more bromine and crude salt resources by finding new underground brine water resources in the Sichuan Province. The Company completed the drilling of its first exploratory well in December 2011 and announced in mid-January 2012 that the Company discovered underground brine water resources in Daying County. It has provided preliminary concentration results after testing by a third-party independent expert. &#160; According to the third-party independent report, the bromine concentration in the underground brine water resources is 1.53 grams per liter, which is approximately six to seven times higher than the average bromine concentration from its brine water resources at our bromine factories in Shouguang City. I n September 2014, the Company started deeper drilling exploration under its existing well and did an exploration analysis on the resources from different levels. We incurred a total of $488,880 in exploration costs during 2014. On January 30, 2015 we announced that we had found natural gas resources under our bromine well in the Sichuan area. Then the Company subsequently hired a third party (a subsidiary of Sinopec) to conduct of survey of this well. Based on the assessment report, the Company estimates this well should produce annual revenue of approximately US$4.7 million and annual net income approximately US$2.3 million per year. &#160; On November 23, 2015 the company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary SCHC entered into an agreement with the People&#8217;s Government of Daying County in Sichuan Province for the exploration and development of natural gas and brine resources (including bromine and crude salt). 

&#160;

In order to improve the bromine and crude salt production capacity, the Company will continue to enhance its existing bromine and crude salt production facilities. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company incurred enhancement works in Factories No. 10 and 11 at costs of approximately $10,396,597 to the protective shells to transmission channels and ducts. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company incurred enhancement projects to our existing bromine extraction in Factory No. 10 and 11 at costs of approximately $12,088,375. The Company expects to carry out enhancement projects for the transmission channels and ducts and our existing bromine extraction in 2016, which will cost approximately $15 million. The company will also expect to invest approximately $10.0 million in Sichuan Province for the natural gas resource project in 2016. The Company expects such enhancement expenditures will be funded by the Company&#8217;s cash on hand. The Company also estimated that the amount of ordinary repair and maintenance expense will be approximately $1.0 million in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9660; Chemical Products 

&#160; To expand its chemical production capacity, on January 12, 2015, the Company entered into an Equity Interest Transfer Agreement with SCRC and its shareholders with total consideration of approximately $80.8 million. On February 4, 2015, the transactions contemplated by the agreement dated January 12, 2015 closed. Pursuant to the agreement, SCHC acquired all rights, title and interest in and to all assets owned by SCRC, a leading manufacturer of materials for human and animal antibiotics in China and other parts of Asia. 

Competition 

To date, our sales have been limited to customers within the PRC and we expect that our sales will remain primarily domestic for the immediate future. Our marketing strategy involves developing long term ongoing working relationships with customers based on large multi-year agreements which foster mutually advantageous relationships. 

&#160; 

We compete with PRC domestic private companies and state-owned companies. Certain state-owned and state backed competitors are more established and have more control of certain resources in terms of pricing than we do. We compete in our business based on price, our reputation for quality and on-time delivery, our relationship with suppliers and our geographical proximity to natural brine deposits in the PRC for bromine, crude salt and chemical productions. Management believes that our stable quality, manufacturing processes and plant capacity for the production of bromine, crude salt and chemical products are key considerations in awarding contracts in the PRC. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors in the bromine business are Shandong Yuyuan Group Company Limited, Shandong Haihua Group Company Limited, Shandong Dadi Salt Chemical Group Company Limited and Shandong Haiwang Chemical Company Limited, all of which produce bromine principally for use in their chemicals businesses and sell part of the bromine produced to customers. These companies may switch to selling bromine to the market if they no longer use bromine in their chemical businesses. 

Our principal competitors in the crude salt business are Shandong Haiwang Chemical Company Limited, Shandong Haihua Group Company Limited, Shandong Weifang Longwei Industrial Company Limited, Shandong Yuyuan Group Company Limited and Shandong Caiyangzi Saltworks. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors in the chemical business are Beijing Tianqing Chemical Company Limited, Shandong Weifang Shuangxing Pesticides Company Limited, Shandong Dacheng Pesticides Company Limited, Binhua Group Company Limited, Dongying City Dongchen (Group) Chemical Industry Company Limited, Beijing Peikangjiaye Technologies Limited, Shouguang Fukang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd, Hunan Erkang Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd and Xinan Synthetic Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the principal governmental laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to our operations in the PRC. The scope and enforcement of many of the laws and regulations described below are uncertain. We cannot predict the effect of further developments in the Chinese legal system, including the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of laws. 

&#160; 

In the natural resources sector, the PRC and the various provinces have enacted a series of laws and regulations over the past 20 years, including laws and regulations designed to improve safety and decrease environmental degradation. The "China Mineral Resources Law" declares state ownership of all mineral resources in the PRC. However, mineral exploration rights can be purchased, sold and transferred to foreign owned companies. Mineral resource rights are granted by the Central Government permitting recipients to conduct mineral resource activities in a specific area during the license period. These rights entitle the licensee to undertake mineral resource activities and infrastructure and ancillary work, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, within the specific area covered by the license during the license period. The licensee is required to submit a proposal and feasibility studies to the relevant authority and to pay the Central Government a natural resources fee in an amount equal to a percent of annual sales. Shandong Province has determined that bromine is to be extracted only by licensed entities and we hold one of such licenses. Despite the province desire to limit extraction to licensed entities hundreds of smaller operations continue to extract bromine without licenses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Ministry of Land and Resources (&#8220;MLR&#8221;) is the principal regulator of mineral rights in China. The Ministry has authority to grant licenses for land-use and exploration rights, issue permits for mineral rights and leases, oversee the fees charged for them and their transfer, and review reserve evaluations. We are required to hold a bromine and salt production license in order to operate our bromine and salt production business in the PRC. Our bromine and salt production license is subject to a yearly audit. If we do not successfully pass the yearly approval by relevant government authorities, our bromine and salt production operations may be suspended until we are able to comply with the license requirements which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

All of our operating activities in China have been authorized by or obtained written consent from land and resources departments of local governments except bromine Factory No.10 and 11. In addition, all of our operations are subject to and have passed government safety inspections. We also have been granted environmental certification from the PRC Bureau of Environmental Protection that is no subject to expiration. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 738 full-time employees, of whom approximately 63% are with SCHC, 16% are with SYCI and 20% are with SCRC. Approximately 6% of our employees are management personnel and 4% are sales and procurement staff. None of our employees are represented by a union. 

&#160; 

Our employees in China participate in a state pension arrangement organized by Chinese municipal and provincial governments. We are required to contribute to the arrangement at the rate of 17% of the average monthly salary. In addition, we are required by Chinese law to cover employees in China with other types of social insurance. Our total contribution amounts to 27% of the average monthly salary. We have purchased social insurance for almost all of our employees. Expense related to social insurance was approximately $980,359 for fiscal year 2015.
