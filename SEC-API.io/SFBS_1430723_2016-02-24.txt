 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and are headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, we operate 18 full-service banking offices located in Jefferson, Shelby, Madison, Montgomery, Houston and Mobile Counties of Alabama, Escambia County, Florida, Cobb and Douglas Counties of Georgia, Charleston County of South Carolina and Davidson County, Tennessee in the metropolitan statistical areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) of Birmingham-Hoover, Huntsville, Montgomery, Dothan and Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent, Florida, Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia, Charleston-North Charleston, South Carolina and Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, Tennessee. Through our bank, we originate commercial, consumer and other loans and accept deposits, provide electronic banking services, such as online and mobile banking, including remote deposit capture, deliver treasury and cash management services and provide correspondent banking services to other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2015, we had total assets of approximately $5.1 billion, total loans of approximately $4.2 billion, total deposits of approximately $4.2 billion and total stockholders&#8217; equity of approximately $449 million.

&#160;

We operate our bank using a simple business model based on organic loan and deposit growth, generated through high quality customer service, delivered by a team of experienced bankers focused on developing and maintaining long-term banking relationships with our target customers. We utilize a uniform, centralized back office risk and credit platform to support a decentralized decision-making process executed locally by our regional chief executive officers. This decentralized decision-making process allows individual lending officers varying levels of lending authority, based on the experience of the individual officer. When the total amount of loans to a borrower exceeds an officer&#8217;s lending authority, further approval must be obtained by the applicable regional chief executive officer (G. Carlton Barker &#8211; Montgomery, Andrew N. Kattos &#8211; Huntsville, B. Harrison Morris, III &#8211; Dothan, Rex D. McKinney &#8211; Pensacola, W. Bibb Lamar, Jr. &#8211; Mobile, Thomas G. Trouche &#8211; Charleston or Kenneth L. Barber - Atlanta) and/or our senior management team. Rather than relying on a more typical traditional, retail bank strategy of operating a broad base of multiple brick and mortar branch locations in each market, our strategy focuses on operating a limited and efficient branch network with sizable aggregate balances of total loans and deposits housed in each branch office. We believe that this approach more appropriately addresses our customers&#8217; banking needs and reflects a best-of-class delivery strategy for commercial banking services.

&#160;

Our principal business is to accept deposits from the public and to make loans and other investments. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investments are demand, time, savings and other deposits and the amortization and prepayment of loans and borrowings. Our principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest and dividends collected on other investments, and service charges. Our principal expenses are interest paid on savings and other deposits, interest paid on our other borrowings, employee compensation, office expenses and other overhead expenses.

&#160;

We previously formed SF Holding 1, Inc. as a subsidiary of our bank. We also formed SF Realty 1, Inc., SF FLA Realty, Inc., and SF GA Realty, Inc., as subsidiaries SF Holding 1, Inc. Each of SF Realty 1, Inc., SF FLA Realty, Inc. and SF GA Realty, Inc. hold and manage participations in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans originated by our bank in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, respectively, and each have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. income tax purposes. Each of these entities is consolidated into the Company.

&#160;

As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. We are required to file reports with the Federal Reserve and are subject to regular examinations by that agency.

&#160;

History 

&#160;

Our bank was founded by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas A. Broughton, III, and commenced banking operations in May 2005 following an initial capital raise of $35 million, the largest capital raise by a de novo bank in the history of Alabama. We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in August 2007 for the purpose of acquiring all of the common stock of our bank, and in November 2007 our holding company became the sole shareholder of the bank by virtue of a plan of reorganization and agreement of merger. In May 2008, following our filing of a registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC, we became a reporting company within the meaning of the Exchange Act and have been filing annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC since 2008. On May 19, 2014, we completed our initial public offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8217;) of common stock. Since the completion of the Offering, our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#8220;SFBS&#8221;.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We are a full service commercial bank focused on providing competitive products, state of the art technology and quality service. Our business philosophy is to operate as a metropolitan community bank emphasizing prompt, personalized customer service to the individuals and businesses located in our primary markets. We aggressively market to our target customers, which include privately held businesses with $2 million to $250 million in annual sales, professionals and affluent consumers whom we believe are underserved by the larger regional banks operating in our markets. We also seek to capitalize on the extensive relationships that our management, directors, advisory directors and stockholders have with the businesses and professionals in our markets.

&#160;

Focus on Core Banking Business. We deliver a broad array of core banking products to our customers. While many large regional competitors and national banks have chosen to develop non-traditional business lines to supplement their net interest income, we believe our focus on traditional commercial banking products driven by a high margin delivery system is a superior method to deliver returns to our stockholders. We emphasize an internal culture of keeping our operating costs as low as practical, which we believe leads to greater operational efficiency. Additionally, our centralized technology and process infrastructure contribute to our low operating costs. We believe this combination of products, operating efficiency and technology make us attractive to customers in our markets. In addition, we provide correspondent banking services to 256 community banks located in 11 states throughout the southern United States. We provide a source of clearing and liquidity to our correspondent bank customers, as well as a wide array of account, credit, settlement and international services.

&#160;

Commercial Bank Emphasis. We have historically focused on people as opposed to places. This strategy translates into a smaller number of brick and mortar branch locations relative to our size, but larger overall branch sizes in terms of total deposits. As a result, as of December 31, 2015 our branches averaged approximately $234.7 million in total deposits. In the more typical retail banking model, branch banks continue to lose traffic to other banking channels which may prove to be an impediment to earnings growth for those banks that have invested in large branch networks. In addition, unlike many traditional community banks, we place a strong emphasis on originating commercial and industrial loans, which comprised approximately 41.8% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Scalable, Decentralized Business Model. We emphasize local decision-making by experienced bankers supported by centralized risk and credit oversight. We believe that the delivery by our bankers of in-market customer decisions, coupled with risk and credit support from our corporate headquarters, allows us to serve our borrowers and depositors directly and in person, while managing risk centrally and on a uniform basis. We intend to continue our growth by repeating this scalable model in each market in which we are able to identify a strong banking team. Our goal in each market is to employ the highest quality bankers in that market. We then empower those bankers to implement our operating strategy, grow our customer base and provide the highest level of customer service possible. We focus on a geographic model of organizational structure as opposed to a line of business model employed by most regional banks. This structure assigns significant responsibility and accountability to our regional chief executive officers, who we believe will drive our growth and success. We have developed a business culture whereby our management team, from the top down, is actively involved in sales, which we believe is a key differentiator from our competition.

&#160;

Identify Opportunities in Vibrant Markets. Since opening our original banking facility in Birmingham in 2005, as of December 31, 2015, we had expanded into eight additional markets. Our focus has been to expand opportunistically when we identify a strong banking team in a market with attractive economic characteristics and market demographics where we believe we can achieve a minimum of $300 million in deposits within five years of market entry. There are two primary factors we consider when determining whether to enter a new market:

&#160;

&#183; the availability of successful, experienced bankers with strong reputations in the market; and &#160;

&#183; the economic attributes of the market necessary to drive quality lending opportunities coupled with deposit-related characteristics of the potential market. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Prior to entering a new market, historically we have identified and built a team of experienced, successful bankers with market-specific knowledge to lead the bank&#8217;s operations in that market, including a regional chief executive officer. Generally, we or members of our senior management team are familiar with these individuals based on prior work experience and reputation, and strongly believe in the ability of such individuals to successfully execute our business model. We also often assemble a non-voting advisory board of directors in our markets, comprised of directors representing a broad spectrum of business experience and community involvement in the market. We currently have advisory boards in each of the Huntsville, Montgomery, Dothan, Mobile, Pensacola and Atlanta markets.

&#160;

We announced the hiring of Gregory W. Bryant as Executive Vice President and Regional CEO of the Tampa Bay area of Florida on January 25, 2016. Mr. Bryant will be establishing a banking presence for us in the Tampa Bay area by hiring a staff of experienced bankers and locating office space.

&#160;

In addition to organic expansion, we may seek to expand through targeted acquisitions.

&#160;

Markets and Competition 

&#160; 

Our primary markets are broadly defined as the metropolitan statistical areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) of Birmingham-Hoover, Huntsville, Montgomery, Dothan and Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent, Florida, Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia, Charleston-North Charleston, South Carolina and Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, Tennessee. We draw most of our deposits from, and conduct most of our lending transactions in, these markets.

&#160;

According to FDIC reports, total deposits in each of our primary market areas have expanded from 2005 to 2015 (deposit data reflects totals as reported by financial institutions as of June 30 th of each year) as follows:

&#160;

Our bank is subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and other financial service providers. Our bank competes for deposits with other local and regional commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as money-market and mutual funds. In making loans, our bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies and other lenders.

&#160;

The following table illustrates our market share, by insured deposits, in our primary service areas at June 30, 2015 (the most recent date such numbers were reported by the FDIC), as reported by the FDIC:

The following table illustrates the combined total deposits for all financial institutions in the counties in which we operate as a percent of the total of all deposits in each state at June 30, 2015, as reported by the FDIC:

&#160;

Alabama &#160; &#160; 57.4 % Florida &#160; &#160; 0.8 % Georgia &#160; &#160; 6.2 % South Carolina &#160; &#160; 12.2 % Tennessee &#160; &#160; 21.5 % &#160;

Each of our regional markets entered into since January 1, 2015 is described below:

&#160;

Atlanta. In January 2015, we entered the Atlanta market with the acquisition of Metro Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary, Metro Bank. The acquisition added two offices, one in nearby Douglasville, Georgia and the other in nearby Kennesaw, Georgia. In July 2015, we opened a new office in the Cobb Galleria Centre located at the intersection of Interstates 75 and 285. The Atlanta MSA is comprised of 28 counties with a population of approximately 5.5 million and is the ninth largest metropolitan area in the country. Atlanta is home to 16 Fortune 500 companies and is considered the transportation/distribution hub of the Southeast. We believe that the number and array of small to mid-sized companies offers us unlimited growth potential. Forbes recently rated Atlanta the third best city in the country for entrepreneurs.

&#160;

Charleston. In January 2015, we announced the hiring of a regional CEO, Thomas G. Trouche, to oversee our entrance and expansion into Charleston, South Carolina. The Charleston-North Charleston MSA comprises Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties in South Carolina, and has a population of over 700,000 people. Major industries in the area include IT and advanced security, aerospace and aviation, biomedical and energy systems. Major employers within these industries are: Boeing, which employs approximately 7,000 workers in the area with an average salary of $77,000; the Medical University of South Carolina, which employs 8,000 directly and 21,000 in jobs that support its efforts; and Joint Base Charleston, which has over 10,000 on active duty and 3,000 on reserve duty. Port activity also drives much of the local economy with 8 million tons of cargo and $45 billion in economic impact annually.

&#160;

Tampa. On January 25, 2016, we announced the hiring of a regional CEO, Gregory W. Bryant, to oversee our entrance and expansion into the Tampa Bay area of Florida. Tampa Bay includes the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater and Lakeland, with a total population of over 5 million. A number of major drivers contribute to the area&#8217;s diverse economy: MacDill Air Force Base, home to Central Command, contributes an estimated $5 billion annually to the local economy; Tampa International Airport, already home to numerous domestic and international carriers, is undergoing a $1 billion expansion; three major league sports teams call the area home; the University of South Florida is ranked 50 th in the nation in research spending; the Port of Tampa is one of the country&#8217;s most diverse seaports, with a bustling cruise business, inbound and outbound bulk cargo, and large ship repair yards; and, the world class beaches mean a healthy tourism industry. Known for a vibrant base of small and mid-size businesses, the area is also home to a number of large employers, including Baycare Medical Systems, Publix Supermarkets, Home Shopping Network, Tech Data, Wellcare HMO, Moffitt Cancer Center, and Busch Gardens.

&#160;

Our retail and commercial divisions operate in highly competitive markets. We compete directly in retail and commercial banking markets with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers and mortgage companies, mutual funds, securities brokers, consumer finance companies, other lenders and insurance companies, locally, regionally and nationally. Many of our competitors compete by using offerings by mail, telephone, computer and/or the Internet. Interest rates, both on loans and deposits, and prices of services are significant competitive factors among financial institutions generally. Providing convenient locations, desired financial products and services, convenient office hours, quality customer service, quick local decision making, a strong community reputation and long-term personal relationships are all important competitive factors that we emphasize.

&#160;

In our primary service areas, our five largest competitors are Regions Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, BBVA Compass Bank, BB&#38;T and Synovus Bank. These institutions, as well as other competitors of ours, have greater resources, serve broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that we do not offer and can better afford, and make broader use of, media advertising, support services, and electronic technology than we can. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation for greater personal service, consistency, and flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lending Services 

&#160; 

Lending Policy 

&#160;

Our lending policies are established to support the credit needs of our primary market areas. Consequently, we aggressively seek high-quality borrowers within a limited geographic area and in competition with other well-established financial institutions in our primary service areas that have greater resources and lending limits than we have.

&#160;

Loan Approval and Review 

&#160;

Our loan approval policies set various levels of officer lending authority. When the total amount of loans to a single borrower exceeds an individual officer&#8217;s lending authority, further approval, up to $3.0 million secured, must be obtained from the Regional CEO and/or our senior management team, based on our loan policies.

&#160;

Commercial Loans 

&#160;

Our commercial lending activity is directed principally toward businesses and professional service firms whose demand for funds falls within our legal lending limits. We make loans to small- and medium-sized businesses in our primary service areas for the purpose of upgrading plant and equipment, buying inventory and for general working capital. Typically, targeted business borrowers have annual sales between $2 million and $250 million. This category of loans includes loans made to individual, partnership and corporate borrowers, and such loans are obtained for a variety of business purposes. We offer a variety of commercial lending products to meet the needs of business and professional service firms in our service areas. These commercial lending products include seasonal loans, bridge loans and term loans for working capital, expansion of the business, or acquisition of property, plant and equipment. We also offer commercial lines of credit. The repayment terms of our commercial loans will vary according to the needs of each customer.

&#160;

Our commercial loans usually will be collateralized. Generally, collateral consists of business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or real estate. Collateral is subject to the risk that we may have difficulty converting it to a liquid asset if necessary, as well as risks associated with degree of specialization, mobility and general collectability in a default situation. To mitigate this risk, we underwrite collateral to strict standards, including valuations and general acceptability based on our ability to monitor its ongoing condition and value.

&#160;

We underwrite our commercial loans primarily on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s cash flow, ability to service debt, and degree of management expertise. As a general practice, we take as collateral a security interest in any available real estate, equipment or personal property. Under limited circumstances, we may make commercial loans on an unsecured basis. Commercial loans may be subject to many different types of risks, including fraud, bankruptcy, economic downturn, deteriorated or non-existent collateral, and changes in interest rates. Perceived and actual risks may differ depending on the particular industry in which a borrower operates. General risks to an industry, such as an economic downturn or instability in the capital markets, or to a particular segment of an industry are monitored by senior management on an ongoing basis. When warranted, loans to individual borrowers who may be at risk due to an industry condition may be more closely analyzed and reviewed by the credit review committee or board of directors. Commercial and industrial borrowers are required to submit financial statements to us on a regular basis. We analyze these statements, looking for weaknesses and trends, and will assign the loan a risk grade accordingly. Based on this risk grade, the loan may receive an increased degree of scrutiny by management, up to and including additional loss reserves being required.

&#160;

Real Estate Loans 

&#160;

We make commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans and residential real estate loans.

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans are generally limited to terms of five years or less, although payments are usually structured on the basis of a longer amortization. Interest rates may be fixed or adjustable, although rates generally will not be fixed for a period exceeding five years. In addition, we generally will require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the property supported by a review by our management of the principal owners&#8217; personal financial statements.

&#160;

Commercial real estate lending presents risks not found in traditional residential real estate lending. Repayment is dependent upon successful management and marketing of properties and on the level of expense necessary to maintain the property. Repayment of these loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve relatively large loan balances to a single borrower. To mitigate these risks, we closely monitor our borrower concentration. These loans generally have shorter maturities than other loans, giving us an opportunity to reprice, restructure or decline renewal. As with other loans, all commercial real estate loans are graded depending upon strength of credit and performance. A higher risk grade will bring increased scrutiny by our management, the credit review committee and the board of directors.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Construction and Development Loans. We make construction and development loans both on a pre-sold and speculative basis. If the borrower has entered into an agreement to sell the property prior to beginning construction, then the loan is considered to be on a pre-sold basis. If the borrower has not entered into an agreement to sell the property prior to beginning construction, then the loan is considered to be on a speculative basis. Construction and development loans are generally made with a term of 12 to 24 months, with interest payable monthly. The ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral as established by independent appraisal typically will not exceed 80% of residential construction loans. Speculative construction loans will be based on the borrower&#8217;s financial strength and cash flow position. Development loans are generally limited to 75% of appraised value. Loan proceeds will be disbursed based on the percentage of completion and only after the project has been inspected by an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector. During times of economic stress, construction and development loans typically have a greater degree of risk than other loan types.

&#160;

To mitigate the risk of construction loan defaults in our portfolio, the board of directors and management tracks and monitors these loans closely. Total construction loans increased $34.5 million in 2015. Our allocation of loan loss reserve for these loans decreased $1.0 million to $5.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $6.4 million at the end 2014. Charge-offs for construction loans decreased from $1.3 million for 2014 to $0.7 million for 2015, and the overall quality of the construction loan portfolio has improved with $4.0 million rated as substandard at December 31, 2015 compared to $5.7 million at December 31, 2014.

&#160;

Residential Real Estate Loans . Our residential real estate loans consist primarily of residential second mortgage loans, residential construction loans and traditional mortgage lending for one-to-four family residences. We will originate fixed-rate mortgages with long-term maturities. The majority of our fixed-rate loans are sold in the secondary mortgage market. All loans are made in accordance with our appraisal policy, with the ratio of the loan principal to the value of collateral as established by independent appraisal generally not exceeding 80%. Risks associated with these loans are generally less significant than those of other loans and involve bankruptcies, economic downturn, customer financial problems and fluctuations in the value of real estate, and homes in our primary service areas may experience significant price declines in the future. We have not made and do not expect to make any &#8220;Alt-A&#8221; or subprime loans.

&#160;

Consumer Loans 

&#160;

We offer a variety of loans to retail customers in the communities we serve. Consumer loans in general carry a moderate degree of risk compared to other loans. They are generally more risky than traditional residential real estate loans but less risky than commercial loans. Risk of default is usually determined by the well-being of the local economies. During times of economic stress, there is usually some level of job loss both nationally and locally, which directly affects the ability of the consumer to repay debt. Risk on consumer-type loans is generally managed through policy limitations on debt levels consumer borrowers may carry and limitations on loan terms and amounts depending upon collateral type.

&#160;

Our consumer loans include home equity loans (open- and closed-end), vehicle financing, loans secured by deposits, and secured and unsecured personal loans. These various types of consumer loans all carry varying degrees of risk.

&#160;

Commitments and Contingencies 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had commitments to extend credit beyond current fundings of approximately $1.4 billion, had issued standby letters of credit in the amount of approximately $38.2 million, and had commitments for credit card arrangements of approximately $62.5 million.

The allowance for loan losses represents our management&#8217;s assessment of the risk associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. In calculating the adequacy of the loan loss allowance, our management evaluates the following factors:

&#160;

&#183; the asset quality of individual loans; &#183; changes in the national and local economy and business conditions/development, including underwriting standards, collections, and charge-off and recovery practices; &#183; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; changes in the experience, ability and depth of our lending staff and management; &#183; changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past-due loans and classified loans, and trends in the volume of non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and other modifications, as has occurred in the residential mortgage markets and particularly for residential construction and development loans; &#183; possible deterioration in collateral segments or other portfolio concentrations; &#183; historical loss experience (when available) used for pools of loans (i.e. collateral types, borrowers, purposes, etc.); &#183; changes in the quality of our loan review system and the degree of oversight by our board of directors; and &#183; the effect of external factors such as competition and the legal and regulatory requirement on the level of estimated credit losses in our current loan portfolio. &#160;

These factors are evaluated quarterly, and changes in the asset quality of individual loans are evaluated as needed.

&#160;

We assign all of our loans individual risk grades when they are underwritten. We have established minimum general reserves based on the risk grade of the loan. We also apply general reserve factors based on historical losses, management&#8217;s experience and common industry and regulatory guidelines.

&#160;

After a loan is underwritten and booked, it is monitored by the account officer, management, internal loan review, and representatives of our independent external loan review firm over the life of the loan. Payment performance is monitored monthly for the entire loan portfolio; account officers contact customers during the regular course of business and may be able to ascertain whether weaknesses are developing with the borrower; independent loan consultants perform a review annually; and federal and state banking regulators perform annual reviews of the loan portfolio. If we detect weaknesses that have developed in an individual loan relationship, we downgrade the loan and assign higher reserves based upon management&#8217;s assessment of the weaknesses in the loan that may affect full collection of the debt. We have established a policy to discontinue accrual of interest (non-accrual status) after any loan has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest unless the loan is considered to be well collateralized and is actively in process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent if management believes that the borrower&#8217;s financial condition is such that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recognized only as received. If a loan will not be collected in full, we increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect our management&#8217;s estimate of any potential exposure or loss.

&#160;

Our net loan losses to average total loans decreased to 0.13% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.17% for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was down from 0.33% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Historical performance, however, is not an indicator of future performance, and our future results could differ materially. As of December 31, 2015, we had $7.8 million of non-accrual loans, of which approximately 75% are secured real estate loans. We have allocated approximately $5.4 million of our allowance for loan losses to real estate construction, acquisition and development, and lot loans, $21.5 million to commercial and industrial loans, $16.1 million to real estate mortgage loans and $0.4 million to consumer loans and have a total loan loss reserve as of December 31, 2015 of $43.4 million. The loan loss reserve methodology incorporates qualitative factors which are based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding various external and internal factors including macroeconomic trends, management&#8217;s assessment of the Company&#8217;s loan growth prospects and evaluations of internal risk controls. Our management believes, based upon historical performance, known factors, overall judgment, and regulatory methodologies, that the current methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reasonable.

&#160;

Our allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators. During their routine examinations of banks, regulatory agencies may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses when, in the opinion of the regulators, credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from those of management.

&#160;

While it is our policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is considered probable, there are additional risks of future losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans. Because these risks include the state of the economy, our management&#8217;s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Investments 

&#160;

In addition to loans, we purchase investments in securities, primarily in mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities. No investment in any of those instruments will exceed any applicable limitation imposed by law or regulation. Our board of directors reviews the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the investments conform to the policy as set by the board of directors. Our investment policy provides that no more than 60% of our total investment portfolio may be composed of municipal securities. All securities held are traded in liquid markets, and we have no auction-rate securities. We had no investments in any one security, restricted or liquid, in excess of 10% of our stockholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Deposit Services 

&#160; 

We seek to establish solid core deposits, including checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and a variety of certificates of deposit and IRA accounts. To attract deposits, we employ an aggressive marketing plan throughout our service areas that features a broad product line and competitive services. The primary sources of core deposits are residents of, and businesses and their employees located in, our market areas. We have obtained deposits primarily through personal solicitation by our officers and directors, through reinvestment in the community, and through our stockholders, who have been a substantial source of deposits and referrals. We make deposit services accessible to customers by offering direct deposit, wire transfer, night depository, banking-by-mail and remote capture for non-cash items. Our bank is a member of the FDIC, and thus our deposits are FDIC-insured.

&#160;

Other Banking Services 

&#160;

Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone banking, direct deposit, Internet banking, mobile banking, traveler&#8217;s checks, safe deposit boxes, attorney trust accounts and automatic account transfers. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Alabama and in other states and, in certain accounts subject to certain conditions, we rebate to the customer the ATM fees automatically after each business day. Additionally, we offer Visa &#174; credit cards.

&#160;

Asset, Liability and Risk Management 

&#160;

We manage our assets and liabilities with the aim of providing an optimum and stable net interest margin, a profitable after-tax return on assets and return on equity, and adequate liquidity. These management functions are conducted within the framework of written loan and investment policies. To monitor and manage the interest rate margin and related interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures to monitor and report on interest rate risk, devise strategies to manage interest rate risk, monitor loan originations and deposit activity and approve all pricing strategies. We attempt to maintain a balanced position between rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. Specifically, we chart assets and liabilities on a matrix by maturity, effective duration, and interest adjustment period, and endeavor to manage any gaps in maturity ranges.

&#160; 

Seasonality and Cycles 

&#160; 

We do not consider our commercial banking business to be seasonal.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We had 371 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2015. We consider our employee relations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees.

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

Both we and our bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on, and provide for general regulatory oversight of, our operations. These laws and regulations require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposits, brokerage and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and restrict our ability to repurchase our stock and receive dividends from our bank. These laws and regulations generally are intended to protect customers, rather than stockholders. The following discussion describes material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us. However, the description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to us.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

Since we own all of the capital stock of the bank, we are a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Acquisition of Banks 

&#160;

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve&#8217;s prior approval before:

&#160;

&#183; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of the bank&#8217;s voting shares; &#160;

&#183; acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or &#160;

&#183; merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. &#160;

Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled &#8220;&#8212;Bank Regulation and Supervision &#8211; Capital Adequacy.&#8221; 

&#160;

Under the BHC Act, if adequately capitalized and adequately managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Alabama may purchase a bank located outside of Alabama. Conversely, an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company located outside of Alabama may purchase a bank located inside Alabama. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits.

&#160;

Change in Bank Control 

&#160;

Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person&#8217;s or company&#8217;s acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company. In addition, any person or group of persons must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of a bank holding company, or otherwise obtaining control or a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over the bank holding company.

&#160; 

Permitted Activities 

&#160; 

Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:

&#160;

&#183; banking or managing or controlling banks; and &#160;

&#183; any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. &#160;

Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: factoring accounts receivable; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; leasing personal property; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; trust company functions; financial and investment advisory activities; discount securities brokerage activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; performing selected data processing services and support services; acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and performing selected insurance underwriting activities. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company&#8217;s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the permissible bank holding company activities listed above, a bank holding company may qualify and elect to become a financial holding company, permitting the bank holding company to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. The BHC Act expressly lists the following activities as financial in nature: lending, trust and other banking activities; insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss or harm, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker for these purposes, in any state; providing financial, investment, or advisory services; issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities; other activities that the Federal Reserve may determine to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to managing or controlling banks; foreign activities permitted outside of the United States if the Federal Reserve has determined them to be usual in connection with banking operations abroad; merchant banking through securities or insurance affiliates; and insurance company portfolio investments. For us to qualify to become a financial holding company, the bank and any other depository institution subsidiary of ours must be well-capitalized and well-managed and must have a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221;. Additionally, we must file an election with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company and must provide the Federal Reserve with 30 days written notice prior to engaging in a permitted financial activity. We have not elected to become a financial holding company at this time.

&#160;

Support of Subsidiary Institutions 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to take measures to preserve and protect its bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted. In addition, where a bank holding company has more than one bank or thrift subsidiary, each of the bank holding company&#8217;s subsidiary depository institutions is responsible for any losses to the FDIC as a result of an affiliated depository institution&#8217;s failure. As a result, a bank holding company may be required to loan money to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. However, any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to such bank&#8217;s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank.

&#160;

Repurchase or Redemption of Securities 

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then-outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions.

&#160;

Bank Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

The bank is subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on, and provide for general regulatory oversight of, our operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the bank&#8217;s customers, rather than our stockholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to the bank.

&#160;

Since the bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Alabama and is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the FDIC and the Alabama Banking Department. The FDIC and the Alabama Banking Department regularly examine the bank&#8217;s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Additionally, the bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. The bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations.

&#160;

Branching 

&#160; 

Under current Alabama law, the bank may open branch offices throughout Alabama with the prior approval of the Alabama Banking Department. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, the bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Alabama. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by acquiring a branch of an existing institution or by setting up a new branch, without merging with an existing institution in the target state, if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. We opened our initial offices in Pensacola, Florida, Nashville, Tennessee and Charleston, South Carolina using this mechanism.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

&#160; 

The bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the full extent provided in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the bank pays assessments to the FDIC for that coverage. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system, an insured institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premium is computed by multiplying the institution&#8217;s assessment base by the institution&#8217;s assessment rate. The following information applies to an institution&#8217;s assessment base and assessment rate:

&#160;

&#183; Assessment Base . An institution&#8217;s assessment base equals the institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets during a particular assessment period, minus the institution&#8217;s average tangible equity capital (that is, Tier 1 capital) during such period. &#183; Assessment Rate . An institution&#8217;s assessment rate is assigned by the FDIC on a quarterly basis. To assign an assessment rate, the FDIC designates an institution as falling into one of four risk categories, or as being a large and highly complex financial institution. The FDIC determines an institution&#8217;s risk category based on the level of the institution&#8217;s capitalization and on supervisory evaluations provided to the FDIC by the institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator. Each risk category designation contains upward and downward adjustment factors based on long-term unsecured debt and brokered deposits. Assessment rates currently range from 0.025% per annum for an institution in the lowest risk category with the maximum downward adjustment, to 0.45% per annum for an institution in the highest risk category with the maximum upward adjustment. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the bank&#8217;s assessment rate was set at $0.0125, or $0.05 annually, per $100 of assessment base. &#160;

In addition to its risk-based insurance assessments, the FDIC also imposes Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments to help pay the $780 million in annual interest payments on the $8 billion of bonds issued in the late 1980s as part of the government rescue of the savings and loan industry. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the bank&#8217;s FICO assessment was equal to $0.0015, or $0.0060 annually, per $100 of assessment base. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019.

&#160;

The FDIC is responsible for maintaining the adequacy of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the amount the bank pays for deposit insurance is affected not only by the risk the bank poses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, but also by the adequacy of the fund to cover the risk posed by all insured institutions. Systemic economic problems and changes in law have put pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund in the past. In this regard, from 2009 to 2012, the United States experienced an unusually high number of bank failures, resulting in significant losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000, and raised the minimum required Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio (i.e., the ratio of the amount on reserve in the Deposit Insurance Fund to the total estimated insured deposits) from 1.15% to 1.35%. To support the Deposit Insurance Fund in light of these types of pressures, the FDIC took several actions in 2009 to supplement the revenues received from its annual deposit insurance premium assessments. Such actions included imposing a one-time special assessment on insured institutions and requiring that insured institutions prepay their regular quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 through 2012. The FDIC&#8217;s possible need to increase assessment rates, charge additional one-time assessment fees, and take other extraordinary actions to support the Deposit Insurance Fund is generally considered to be greater in periods of economic downturn. If the FDIC were to take these types of actions in the future, they could have a negative impact on the bank&#8217;s earnings.

&#160;

Termination of Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits of a bank if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

&#160;

Liability of Commonly Controlled Depository Institutions 

&#160; 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver, and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC&#8217;s claim for damage is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors, other general and senior creditors, and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the institution.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open an office or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA-related agreements.

&#160;

Interest Rate Limitations 

&#160; 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.

&#160; 

Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions 

&#160; 

The bank&#8217;s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including:

&#160;

&#183; the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; &#160;

&#183; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; &#160;

&#183; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; &#160;

&#183; the Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; &#160;

&#183; the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; &#160;

&#183; the Servicemembers&#8217; Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; &#160;

&#183; rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws; &#160;

&#183; the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and &#160;

&#183; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. &#160; 

Capital Adequacy 

&#160; 

The federal banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution&#8217;s financial soundness. In this regard, we and the bank are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve (in our case) and the FDIC and the Alabama Banking Department (in the case of the bank). Such standards are based on the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance-sheet items, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items.

&#160;

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and certain other restrictions on its business. Significant additional restrictions can be imposed on FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements.

&#160;

Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital rules applicable to us and the bank were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, of the Basel Committee. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the final Basel III Rules Implementing the Basel III framework. These rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries, including us and the bank, when compared to the general risk-based capital rules under Basel I. The Basel III rules became effective for us and the bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions) and are described more fully below:

&#160;

Basel III 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, known as Basel III. The Basel III calibration and phase-in arrangements were previously endorsed by the Seoul G20 Leaders Summit in November 2010. Under these standards, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, banking institutions would be required to satisfy three risk-based capital ratios:

&#160;

&#183; a new common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0%, inclusive of a 4.5% minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, net of regulatory deductions, and a new 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of common equity to risk-weighted assets; &#183; a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; and &#183; a total capital ratio of at least 10.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. &#160;

Basel III places more emphasis than previous capital adequacy requirements on common equity tier 1 capital, or &#8220;CET1,&#8221; which is predominately made up of retained earnings and common stock instruments. Basel III also introduces a capital conservation buffer, which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1 ratio above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall. The Basel Committee also announced that a &#8220;countercyclical buffer&#8221; of 0% to 2.5% of CET1 or other loss-absorbing capital &#8220;will be implemented according to national circumstances&#8221; as an &#8220;extension&#8221; of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth.

&#160;

Basel III also introduced a non-risk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3%, based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets.

&#160;

United States Implementation of Basel III 

&#160;

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement, in part, agreements reached by the Basel Committee and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules apply to banking organizations, including us and the bank.

&#160;

Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce CET1; (ii) specify that tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and additional financial instruments satisfying specified requirements that permit inclusion in tier 1 capital; (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions or adjustments from capital as compared to the previous regulations. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide a permanent exemption from the proposed phase out of existing trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock from regulatory capital for banking organizations with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratios:

&#160;

&#183; 4.5% based upon CET1; 

&#183; 6.0% based upon tier 1 capital; and 

&#183; 8.0% based upon total regulatory capital. &#160;

A minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of total assets) of 4.0% is also required under the Basel III Capital Rules (even for highly rated institutions). The Basel III Capital Rules additionally require institutions to retain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these required minimum capital ratio levels. Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum 2.5% capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules became effective as applied to us and the bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, our ratio of total CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 9.72%.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have also specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds for each of those categories. When effective, the Basel III Capital Rules will amend those thresholds to reflect both (i) the generally heightened requirements for regulatory capital ratios, and (ii) the introduction of the CET1 capital measure. At December 31, 2015, the bank qualified for the well-capitalized category.

&#160;

Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.

&#160;

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company&#8217;s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution also is generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.

&#160; 

Liquidity 

&#160;

Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-13-2010 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions.

&#160;

Basel III also addresses liquidity management by proposing two new liquidity metrics for financial institutions. The first metric is the &#8220;Liquidity Coverage Ratio&#8221;, and it aims to require a financial institution to maintain sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario that lasts for one month. The second metric is the &#8220;Net Stable Funding Ratio,&#8221; and its objective is to require a financial institution to maintain a minimum amount of stable sources relative to the liquidity profiles of the institution&#8217;s assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity needs arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon.

&#160;

In the Basel III Capital Rules, the federal banking regulators did not address either the Liquidity Coverage Ratio or the Net Stable Funding Ratio. However, on November 29, 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued a proposed rule implementing a Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement in the United States for larger banking organizations. Neither we nor the bank would be subject to such requirement as proposed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio continue to be monitored for implementation, and we cannot yet provide concrete estimates as to how those requirements, or any other regulatory positions regarding liquidity and funding, might affect us or our bank. However, we note that increased liquidity requirements generally would be expected to cause the bank to invest its assets more conservatively&#8212;and therefore at lower yields&#8212;than it otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce the bank&#8217;s revenue stream, and in turn its earnings potential.

&#160;

Payment of Dividends 

&#160;

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, is dividends the bank pays to us as the bank&#8217;s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the bank&#8217;s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our stockholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its stockholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Delaware corporate law.

&#160;

The Alabama Banking Department also regulates the bank&#8217;s dividend payments. Under Alabama law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90% of its net earnings until the bank&#8217;s surplus is equal to at least 20% of its capital (our bank&#8217;s surplus currently exceeds 20% of its capital). Moreover, our bank is also required by Alabama law to obtain the prior approval of the Superintendent of Banks (&#8220;Superintendent&#8221;) for its payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) the bank&#8217;s net earnings (as defined by statute) for that year, plus (ii) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. Based on this, our bank would be limited to paying $141.8 million in dividends as of December 31, 2015. In addition, no dividends, withdrawals or transfers may be made from the bank&#8217;s surplus without the prior written approval of the Superintendent.

&#160;

The bank&#8217;s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. If, in the opinion of the federal banking regulators, the bank were engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, the federal banking regulators could require, after notice and a hearing, that the bank stop or refrain from engaging in the questioned practice.

&#160;

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

&#160; 

We are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of: a bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates; a bank&#8217;s investment in affiliates; assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; loans or extensions of credit made by a bank to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; a bank&#8217;s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate; a bank&#8217;s transactions with an affiliate involving the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent they create credit exposure to the affiliate; and a bank&#8217;s derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent they create credit exposure to the affiliate. The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, certain of these transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets.

&#160;

We are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in these transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

&#160;

The bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution&#8217;s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Alabama state banking laws also have similar provisions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Lending Limits 

&#160; 

Under Alabama law, the amount of loans which may be made by a bank in the aggregate to one person is limited. Alabama law provides that unsecured loans by a bank to one person may not exceed an amount equal to 10% of the capital and unimpaired surplus of the bank or 20% in the case of secured loans. For purposes of calculating these limits, loans to various business interests of the borrower, including companies in which a substantial portion of the stock is owned or partnerships in which a person is a partner, must be aggregated with those made to the borrower individually. Loans secured by certain readily marketable collateral are exempt from these limitations, as are loans secured by deposits and certain government securities.

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Concentration Limits 

&#160;

In December 2006, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued guidance entitled &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices&#8221; to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loans. The guidance describes the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution&#8217;s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution&#8217;s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution&#8217;s CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk.

&#160; 

Privacy 

&#160; 

Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their consumer customers. Consumer customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers.

&#160; 

Consumer Credit Reporting 

&#160;

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (the &#8220;FCRA&#8221;) imposes, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, place a fraud alert in the consumer&#8217;s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; &#160;

&#183; requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies (which would include our bank) to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; &#160;

&#183; requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers; and &#160;

&#183; limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. &#160; 

Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation 

&#160; 

Our bank is subject to the USA Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the requirements of OFAC. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and account and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established a customer identification program pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act and maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 

&#160; 

Our bank&#8217;s earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict, and have no control over, the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered, or that file reports, under the Exchange Act. In particular, the act established (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii) responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company and new requirements for them to certify the accuracy of periodic reports; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) civil and criminal penalties for violations of the federal securities laws. The legislation also established a new accounting oversight board to enforce auditing standards and restrict the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients.

&#160;

Overdraft Fees 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve has adopted amendments under its Regulation E that impose restrictions on banks&#8217; abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions.

&#160; 

Interchange Fees 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act, through a provision known as the Durbin Amendment, required the Federal Reserve to establish standards for interchange fees that are &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the cost of processing the debit card transaction and imposes other requirements on card networks. Institutions like the bank with less than $10 billion in assets are exempt. However, while we are under the $10 billion level that caps income per transaction, we have been affected by federal regulations that prohibit network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. Essentially, issuers and networks must allow transaction processing through a minimum of two unaffiliated networks.

&#160;

The Volcker Rule 

&#160;

On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted a final rule implementing the so-called &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and prohibits &#8220;banking entities&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and making investments and conducting certain other activities with &#8220;private equity funds and hedge funds.&#8221; Although the final rule provides some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including us and the bank. The final rule became effective April 1, 2014, but the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for all banking entities until July 21, 2015.

&#160;

While the final rule and its accompanying materials comprise approximately 1,000 pages, banking entities that do not engage in any of the activities covered by the Volcker Rule (other than with respect to certain U.S. government obligations) are not required to adopt any formal compliance program specific to the Volcker Rule. We have reviewed the scope of the final rule and have concluded that it does not impact our operations.

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted, this new law is significantly changing the bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many years.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this Supervision and Regulation section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and the bank.

&#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau now has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulator. &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower&#8217;s &#8220;ability to repay&#8221; a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements were effective in 2014. &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. &#160;

&#183; The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. &#160;

&#183; While insured depository institutions have long been subject to the FDIC&#8217;s resolution process, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism for the FDIC to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain &#8220;covered financial companies,&#8221; including bank holding companies and systemically significant non-bank financial companies. Upon certain findings being made, the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a covered financial company, and would conduct an orderly liquidation of the entity. The FDIC liquidation process is modeled on the existing Federal Deposit Insurance Act bank resolution process, and generally gives the FDIC more discretion than in the traditional bankruptcy context. The FDIC has issued final rules implementing the orderly liquidation authority. &#160;

As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations clearly will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Other Legislation and Regulatory Action relating to Financial Institutions 

&#160; 

Recent government efforts to strengthen the U.S. financial system, including the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;), the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (&#8220;EESA&#8221;), the Dodd-Frank Act, and special assessments imposed by the FDIC, subject us, to the extent applicable, to additional regulatory fees, corporate governance requirements, restrictions on executive compensation, restrictions on declaring or paying dividends, restrictions on stock repurchases, limits on tax deductions for executive compensation and prohibitions against golden parachute payments. These fees, requirements and restrictions, as well as any others that may be imposed in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating or doing business in the United States and the states in which we do business. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute.
