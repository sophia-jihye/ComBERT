Our business focus is transportation-related technology services. We are currently exploring the online, on-demand logistics market by developing a shared economy network of trucking partnerships. We are in the process of building a shared economy app designed to put independent drivers and brokers together for more efficient pricing and booking, optimized operations and quick delivery turnarounds. We have signed a letter of intent with a Houston-area software design firm regarding development of such a platform. This app, when released, will revolutionize the trucking industry by connecting national and local carriers, enabling each to maximize revenues and reduce costs.
