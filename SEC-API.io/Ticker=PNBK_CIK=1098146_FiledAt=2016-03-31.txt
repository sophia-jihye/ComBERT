 ITEM 1. &#160; Business &#160; General 

&#160; 

Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;The Company&#8221; or &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Connecticut corporation, is a one-bank holding company for Patriot Bank, N.A, a national banking association headquartered in Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Bank received its charter and commenced operations as a national bank on August 31, 1994. The Bank currently has eight branch offices in Connecticut. The Bank also has branch offices in Bedford and Scarsdale, both located in Westchester County, New York. 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2003, The Company formed Patriot National Statutory Trust I (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company primarily invested the funds from the issuance of the debt in the Bank. The Bank in turn used the proceeds to fund general operations. 

&#160; 

On April 1, 2008, the Bank acquired a 20% interest in a de novo insurance agency. The impact on the Bank&#8217;s operations in 2011, 2012 and 2013 had been minimal. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bank sold its interest in the de novo insurance agency. 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2010, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Securities Purchase Agreement&#8221;), the Company issued and sold to PNBK Holdings LLC (&#8220;Holdings&#8221;), an investment limited liability company controlled by Michael Carrazza, 3.36 million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $15.00 per share (adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split discussed below) for an aggregate purchase price of $50.4 million. The shares sold to Holdings represented 87.6% of the Company&#8217;s then issued and outstanding common stock. The par value of the common stock was changed to $0.01 per share. Also in connection with that sale, certain directors and officers of both the Company and the Bank resigned and were replaced with nominees of Holdings and Michael Carrazza became Chairman of the Board of the Company. 

&#160;

As of the date hereof, the only business of the Company is its ownership of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Bank and the Trust. Except as specifically noted otherwise herein, the balance of the description of the Company&#8217;s business is a description of the Bank&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

On February 26, 2013, the Company announced the appointment of Kenneth T. Neilson as President and Chief Executive Officer of both the Company and the Bank effective March 18, 2013. This was following the departure of Christopher Maher, who resigned as President, CEO and director of the Company and the Bank for personal reasons. Mr. Neilson had served as a director of the Company since 2010. 

&#160; 

On March 4, 2015, the Company affected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. All common stock and per share data included in 2014 and 2013 financial statements have been restated to give effect to the reverse stock split. 

&#160;

During 2015, Mr. Michael Carrazza sold 325,000 shares of PNBK Holding LLC, to third party where the third party has sole voting rights and dispositive power for sold shares. Following this transaction it makes Mr. Carrazza&#8217;s holdings in PNBK Holding LLC to 75.65% at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

On September 28, 2015, the Bank changed its name from Patriot National Bank to Patriot Bank, N.A., and the strategic approach to the way it provides value to its customers, community, and the market place. The name change came after the Bank has reported eight consecutive quarters of increased earnings. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Operations 

&#160; 

The Bank conducts business at its main office located in Stamford, Connecticut and at other Connecticut branch offices located in Darien, Fairfield, Greenwich, Milford, Norwalk, Trumbull, and Westport. In New York State, the Bank conducts business at branch offices located in Bedford and Scarsdale. The Bank also operates a loan origination office at 900 Bedford Street, Stamford, Connecticut. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and a variety of consumer loans with an emphasis on serving the needs of individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and professionals. The Bank previously had offered loans on residential real estate, but discontinued doing so during 2013. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities are conducted principally in Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut and Westchester County in New York, although the Bank&#8217;s loan business is not necessarily limited to these areas. 

&#160; 

Consumer and commercial deposit accounts offered include: checking, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal &#8220;NOW&#8221;, money market, time certificates of deposit, savings, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS, Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;) and Health Savings Accounts (&#8220;HSAs&#8221;). Other services offered by the Bank include include Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) transfers, lockbox, internet banking, bill paying, remote deposit capture, debit cards, money orders, traveler&#8217;s checks and automatic teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;). In addition, the Bank may in the future offer other financial services. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s employees perform most routine day-to-day banking transactions. The Bank has entered into a number of arrangements with third parties for banking services such as correspondent banking, check clearing, data processing services, credit card processing and armored car carrier service. 

&#160; 

In the normal course of business and subject to applicable government regulations, the Bank invests a portion of its assets in investment securities, which may include government securities. An objective of the Bank&#8217;s investment policy is to maintain a balance of high quality diversified investments to minimize risk while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and limiting its exposure to interest rate movements and credit risk. Government agency issues currently comprise the majority of the Bank&#8217;s investment portfolio. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 95 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees. None of the employees of the Company are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Bank competes with a variety of financial institutions for loans and deposits in its market area. These include larger financial institutions with greater financial resources, larger branch systems and higher lending limits as well as the ability to conduct larger advertising campaigns to attract business. The larger institutions may also offer additional services such as trust and international banking which the Bank is not equipped to offer directly. When the need arises, arrangements are made with correspondent institutions to provide such services. To attract business in this competitive environment, the Bank relies on local promotional activities, personal contact by officers and directors, customer referrals and on its ability to distinguish itself by offering personalized and responsive banking service. 

&#160; 

The customer base of the Bank generally is meant to be diversified so that there is not a concentration of either loans or deposits within a single industry, a group of industries, a single person or groups of people. The Bank is not dependent on one or a few major customers for its lending or deposit activities, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Bank. 

The Bank&#8217;s loan customers extend beyond the towns and cities in which the Bank has branch offices, including nearby towns in Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut, and Westchester County and the five boroughs of New York City in New York, although the Bank&#8217;s loan business is not necessarily limited to these areas. While the Bank does not currently hold or intend to attract significant deposit or loan business from major corporations with headquarters in its market area, the Bank believes that small manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers along with service industries, professionals and related businesses which have been attracted to this area, as well as the individuals that reside in this area, represent current and potential customers of the Bank. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In recent years, intense market demands, economic pressures and significant legislative and regulatory actions have eroded banking industry classifications which were once clearly defined and have increased competition among banks, as well as other financial institutions including non-bank competitors. This increase in competition has caused banks and other financial service institutions to diversify their services and become more cost effective. The impact on banks and other financial institutions of market dynamics and legislative and regulatory changes has increased customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors and increased merger activity among banks and other financial institutions. 

&#160; &#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Company&#8217;s operations are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The Federal Reserve Board has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that are similar of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) capital guidelines applicable to the Bank. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), limits the types of companies that a bank holding company may acquire or organize and the activities in which it or they may engage. In general, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are only permitted to engage in, or acquire direct control of, any company engaged in banking or in a business so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Federal legislation enacted in 1999 authorizes certain entities to register as financial holding companies. Registered financial holding companies are permitted to engage in businesses, including securities and investment banking businesses, which are prohibited to bank holding companies. The creation of financial holding companies has had no significant impact on the Company. 

&#160; 

Under the BHC Act, the Company is required to file quarterly with the Federal Reserve Board a report of its operations. The Company, the Bank and any other subsidiaries are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company, to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Moreover, the Company, the Bank and any other subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any property or services. The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on issuing any extension of credit to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or making any investments in the stock or other securities thereof and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. If the Company wants to engage in businesses permitted to financial holding companies but not to bank holding companies, it would need to register with the Federal Reserve Board as a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses its view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the bank holding company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board has also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if its bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated retained earnings. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to capital adequacy rules and guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220; FDIC &#8221;), and the Bank is subject to capital adequacy rules and guidelines issued by the OCC. These substantially identical rules and guidelines require the Company to maintain certain minimum ratios of capital to adjusted total assets and/or risk-weighted assets. Under the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act of 1991, the Federal regulatory agencies are required to implement and enforce these rules in a stringent manner. The Company is also subject to applicable provisions of Connecticut law insofar as they do not conflict with, or are not otherwise preempted by, Federal banking law. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act &#8221; ), and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The Bank&#8217;s operations are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Federal and state banking regulations govern, among other things, the scope of the business of a bank, a bank holding company or a financial holding company, the investments a bank may make, deposit reserves a bank must maintain, the establishment of branches and the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and acquisitions. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and as such, is subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations there-under. The Bank is subject to the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, as well as various other federal and state laws and consumer protection laws. The Bank is also subject to the comprehensive provisions of the National Bank Act. 

&#160; 

The OCC regulates the number and locations of branch offices of a national bank. The OCC may only permit a national bank to maintain branches in locations and under the conditions imposed by state law upon state banks. At this time, applicable Connecticut banking laws do not impose any material restrictions on the establishment of branches by Connecticut banks throughout Connecticut. New York State law is similar; however, the Bank cannot establish a branch in a town with a population of less than 50,000 if another bank is headquartered in the town. 

&#160; 

The earnings and growth of the Company, the Bank and the banking industry are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policy to curb inflation and combat recession. The Federal Reserve Board uses its power to adjust interest rates in United States Government securities, the Discount Rate and deposit reserve retention rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits. They also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to other laws and regulations, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA &#8221; ), which requires the federal bank regulatory agencies, when considering certain applications involving the Company or the Bank, to consider the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA was originally enacted because of concern over unfair treatment of prospective borrowers by banks and over unwarranted geographic differences in lending patterns. Existing banks have sought to comply with CRA in various ways; some banks have made use of more flexible lending criteria for certain types of loans and borrowers (consistent with the requirement to conduct safe and sound operations), while other banks have increased their efforts to make loans to help meet identified credit needs within the consumer community, such as those for home mortgages, home improvements and small business loans. Compliance may also include participation in various government insured lending programs, such as Federal Housing Administration insured or Veterans Administration guaranteed mortgage loans, Small Business Administration loans, and participation in other types of lending programs such as high loan-to-value ratio conventional mortgage loans with private mortgage insurance. To date, the market area from which the Bank draws much of its business is in the towns and cities in which the Bank has branch offices, which are characterized by a very diverse ethnic, economic and racial cross-section of the population. As the Bank expands further, the market areas served by the Bank will continue to evolve. The Company and the Bank have not and will not adopt any policies or practices, which discourage credit applications from, or unlawfully discriminate against, individuals or segments of the communities served by the Bank. 

&#160; 

On October 26, 2001, the United and Strengthening America by Providing Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, was enacted to further strengthen domestic security following the September 11, 2001 attacks. This Act amended various federal banking laws, particularly the Bank Secrecy Act, with the intent to curtail money laundering and other activities that might be undertaken to finance terrorist actions. The Act also requires that financial institutions in the United States enhance already established anti-money laundering policies, procedures and audit functions and ensure that controls are reasonably designed to detect instances of money laundering through certain correspondent or private banking accounts. Verification of customer identification, maintenance of said verification records and cross checking names of new customers against government lists of known or suspected terrorists is also required. The Patriot Act was reauthorized and modified with the enactment of The USA Patriot Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005. 

&#160; 

On July 20, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted, the primary purpose of which is to protect investors through improved corporate governance and responsibilities of, and disclosures by, public companies. The Act contains provisions for the limitations of services that external auditors may provide as well as requirements for the credentials of Audit Committee members. In addition, the principal executive and principal financial officers are required to certify in quarterly and annual reports that they have reviewed the report; and based on the officers&#8217; knowledge, the reports accurately present the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and contain no untrue statement or omission of material fact. The officers also certify their responsibility for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls, which insure that all material information is made known to the officers; this certification also includes the evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and their impact upon financial reporting. Section 404 of the Act, entitled Management Assessment of Internal Controls, requires that each annual report include an internal control report which states that it is the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting, as well as an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This section further requires that the external auditors attest to, and report on, the Company&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted an exemption to the attestation and the reporting on the Company&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting by the external auditors for non-accelerated filers, those with public float of less than $75 million.

Recent Legislative Developments 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was signed into law on July 21, 2010 and has had a major impact on the financial services industry, including the organization, financial condition and operations of banks and bank holding companies. Many of the provisions of the Act are aimed at financial institutions that are significantly larger than the Company and the Bank. Notwithstanding this, there are many other provisions that the Company and the Bank are subject to and have to comply with, including any applicable rules promulgated by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. As rules and regulations are promulgated by the agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing the Act, the Company and the Bank will have to address each to ensure compliance with applicable provisions of the Act and compliance costs are expected to increase. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Under rules issued by the FDIC in February 2011, the base for insurance assessments changed from domestic deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risks of the institution being assessed. The rule was effective beginning April 1, 2011. This did not have a material impact on the Company. 

&#160; 

On June 28, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final debit-card interchange rule. This primarily impacts larger banks and did not have a material impact on the Company. 

&#160; 

It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact yet to be implemented Dodd-Frank Act rules and regulations will have on the Company. Financial reform legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and the Bank&#8217;s ability to conduct business. Management will have to apply resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase its costs of operations and adversely impact its earnings. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. Banking organizations. The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to the current U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Capital Rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. The Company has not experienced any difficulties in complying with these new regulations. 

&#160; &#160;

Recent Developments with Regulators 

&#160; 

In September 2014, the Bank&#8217;s formal written agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which had been entered into in February 2009 was terminated. The Agreement required the Bank to review, adopt and implement a number of policies and programs related to credit and operational issues.
