 I TEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

Issuer Direct Corporation (Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as &#8220;Issuer Direct&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Our&#8221; unless otherwise noted). We are a Delaware corporation formed in October 1988 under the name Docucon Incorporated. In December 2007, we changed our name to Issuer Direct Corporation. Our corporate offices are located at 500 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite D, Morrisville, North Carolina, 27560. 

&#160; 

Businesses 

&#160; 

Issuer Direct is a market leader and innovator of Disclosure Management Systems and Cloud&#8211;based Compliance Technologies. The Company&#8217;s core technology platform &#8211; the Disclosure Management System (DMS) &#8211; is a secure cloud-based workflow compliance and communications system for corporate issuers, funds, and compliance professionals. 

&#160; 

We work with a diverse client base in the financial services industry, including brokerage firms, banks and mutual funds. We also sell products and services to corporate issuers, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations, and the accounting and the legal community. Corporate issuers and their constituents utilize our cloud-based platform and related services from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, platforms and shareholders. 

&#160; 

The Company strives to be a market leader and innovator of disclosure management solutions, shareholder communications tools and cloud&#8211;based compliance technologies. With a focus on corporate issuers and mutual funds, the Company alleviates the complexity of maintaining compliance with its integrated portfolio of products and services that enhance companies' ability to efficiently produce and distribute their financial and business communications both online and in print. 

&#160; 

We report our product and service revenue in three revenue streams: 

&#160;

Company Spotlight 

&#160; 

We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services, and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed below. This list may be updated from time to time on our investor relations website:

&#160; 

Disclosure Management 

&#160; 

Our disclosure business consists of our traditional document conversion, typesetting and pre-press design services, XBRL tagging services, and the issuance of securities as it relates to our stock transfer business. These services represent our disclosure offerings that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

&#160; 

A portion of our disclosure business also comes from strategic relationships, where we manage the compliance functions for our partners&#8217; clients. Since we do not have the relationship with the end client, it is difficult to predict the growth from this business. We have seen some partner client attrition in the smaller cap space, due to significant pricing pressure. 

&#160; 

Shareholder Communications 

&#160; 

Our shareholder communications offerings are centered around annual and quarterly earnings events of a public company, which includes our press release distribution, investor outreach and engagement services, webcast teleconference services, investor hotline and our legacy proxy and printing services. Many of these services are marketed and bundled under annual agreements. Like our disclosure business, our communications offerings help make up our proprietary cloud-based platform. This platform has become a significant competitive advantage when competing in the corporate issuer marketplace. 

&#160; 

Press Release Distribution 

&#160; 

Our press release platform, Accesswire, is a cost-effective FD ( Fair Disclosure ) news dissemination service. We acquired the business on October 29, 2014. Accesswire is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely for other shareholder communications services. A disruption in any of these partnership relationships could have an adverse impact on our business. 

&#160; 

The Accesswire business focuses on press release distribution for both private and publicly held companies. We anticipate the press release business to be an area where we will continue to add new clients throughout 2016 and beyond, and as such, we will continue to brand our press release offerings under the name Accesswire, which we believe will solidify our market position in the newswire business. 

&#160; 

Investor Outreach and Engagement 

&#160; 

Our investor outreach and engagement offering is known as the Annual Report Service (ARS), which was acquired from PrecisionIR. The ARS business has existed for 23 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses globally for tens of thousands of customers. As part of our integration with PrecisionIR during 2014, we updated these legacy systems and integrated them into our disclosure management platform. We intend to continue to operate a portion of this legacy system as well as migrate the remaining install base over to our new outreach and engagement offering we now call Investor Network, which is a digital platform and outreach engagement dataset. 

&#160; 

Webcasting &#8211; Teleconference 

&#160; 

There are over 5,000 companies in North America conducting earnings events that include teleconference, webcast or both as part of their events. Our platform incorporates each element of the earnings event including earnings announcement, earnings press release, and SEC Form 8-K filings. There are a handful of our competitors that can offer this today, however, we believe our integrated approach offers a more effective way to attract shareholders and prospective investors. Additionally, all webcasts and teleconferences are broadcast live on our Investor Network properties, which allow companies to reach a broader audience. We believe this is a competitive advantage that has proven to be effective. &#160; 

&#160; 

We currently market and sell our webcasting platforms and teleconference systems in North America, United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany, the current markets in which the Company has clients subscribing to its Investor Network platform. 

&#160; 

Investor Hotline 

&#160; 

One of the oldest and most trusted platforms in the financial services industry is our Investor Hotline platform, which is used by more Fortune 500 companies than any other product or service we offer. Our clients license our platform to integrate into their corporate investor relations platform and or utilize our call center product by including their unique toll-free number into their proxy and annual meeting services. 

&#160; 

Proxy &#8211; Printing 

&#160; 

Our proxy business is marketed as a fully integrated, real-time voting platform for our corporate issuers and their shareholders of record. This platform &#160; is utilized for every annual meeting and or special meeting we manage for our client base and offers both full-set mailing and notice of internet availability options. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Platform &#38; Technology 

&#160; 

As the Company continues its full transition to a cloud-based subscription business, it expects the Platform and Technology portion of its business to continue to expand and become the predominant business of the Company over the foreseeable future. Leading this transition are product subscriptions from each of our core businesses, disclosure management and shareholder communications. 

&#160; 

In disclosure management, Blueprint is our cloud-based document conversion, editing and filing platform for corporate issuers seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filings processes. Blueprint is available in both a secure public cloud within the Company&#8217;s disclosure management system, as well as in a private cloud for corporations and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process. Blueprint includes both the Edgar and XBRL process for corporate issuers, which leads us to market this solution directly to public companies, mutual funds and the compliance and legal community that serves the industry. 

&#160; 

Our belief is that once fully marketed and as Blueprint sales begin to ramp, we will see a negative impact on our legacy disclosure services business over a defined period. However, the margins associated with our subscription business compared to our services business are considerably better and align with our long-term strategy, as such we believe Blueprint will have a positive impact to our net income in the future. 

&#160; 

With our shareholder communications business, we are going to see the biggest change, beginning with Classify &#8211; our initial buy-side, sell-side and media targeting database and intelligence platform. This new subscription-based platform is centered around both our shareholder communications and news distribution businesses. The Company believes its data-set will be a compelling option to both the investor relations, public relations and corporate issuer markets looking for an alternative to current products in the market, based on price and flexibility, as well as data quality and quantity. Because this is a new offering for Issuer Direct, which will complement other products and services, the Company anticipates Classify will increase our average revenue per user (&#8220;ARPU&#8221;) in 2016 based on its competitive cloud licensing options. 

&#160; 

Additionally, our product roadmap includes further development of both our Investor Network and Classify products that we will continue to commercialize and bring to market during 2016. These two new cloud-based products will be a key component of our communications technology business. We expect the proprietary data-set to generate revenues from the corporate issuers initially then to the investment community thereafter. The Investor Network will replace the Annual Report Service (ARS) and Company Spotlight brands as we continue to transition this business from hard copy to digital delivery and real-time engagement. 

&#160; 

In the teleconference and webcasting space we are continuing to spend time developing and integrating our current systems and processes with our disclosure management system. The earnings event business is a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in the investor and communications firms. We have performed well and expanded this business in 2015 by increasing the number of customers licensing our webcasting software and believe that will continue moving into 2016. 

&#160; 

Our Technology Platform - Disclosure Management System (DMS) 

&#160; 

Our DMS is a secure cloud-based business process reporting and automation solution that gives users the ability to disclose, manage, and communicate their respective messages from our enterprise cloud-based platform. Our unique disclosure process aims to create efficiencies not previously possible in areas of normal regulatory business functions of the public markets, where we can clearly improve processes, streamline complexities, while reducing expenditures, generally associated with reporting and disclosure. 

&#160; 

Our DMS is the only secure workflow technology available today that allows officers, directors, compliance and investor/public relations&#8217; professionals the ability to manage the entire back-office functions of their respective companies from one interface. 

&#160; 

The industry as a whole has chosen to focus their solutions and platforms on one single business process or, in some cases, the solutions and platforms are dependent on a complex ERP or accounting system integration in hopes of providing a clear return on investment over a long-term period. Unfortunately, this approach requires companies to invest deeply in enterprise wide systems, for the promise of efficiencies and cost savings. Our approach has been to focus on a collection of business processes that typically overlap service organizations that have either been cumbersome, costly or broken; then, integrate, streamline and improve the flow of information in a more transparent and accurate manner, putting the control back in the hands of our clients, the corporate issuer. The result is better controls, improved processes, efficient disclosure, increased communication and access to analytics. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Today, the platform that makes up our disclosure management system which is used by thousands of officers, directors and compliance and communication professionals, includes the following applications: 

&#160; 

&#9679;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We strive to improve the way businesses collect, manage, communicate, report and analyze their data. Our overall strategy includes: 

&#160; 

Expansion of Current Customers 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to see demand for our products within our client base. Migrating client contracts over to our subscription-based platforms will naturally help align the Company&#8217;s revenue with its long-term strategies. Additionally, as part of our client expansion efforts, we are committed to working beyond the single point of contact and into the entire C suite (CEO, CFO, IRO, Corporate Secretary, etc.). 

&#160; 

Focus on Organic Growth 

&#160; 

Our primary growth strategy continues to be selling our subscription-based platforms via our DMS to new clients under our cloud-based arrangement, whereas in the past we tended to sell single solutions and not subscriptions, in highly commoditized businesses, that resulted in significant pricing pressures. 

&#160; 

New Offerings 

&#160; 

During 2016 and going forward, we will continue to innovate, improve and build new applications into and with our DMS platform; with the ultimate objective of developing applications not offered by our competitors. As a company focused on technology offerings, we understand the importance of advancements and fully appreciate the risks and consequences of losing our position as a market leader- a very common mistake many technology companies have made. The pursuit of technological innovation is and has been a part of our overall strategy as an organization over the last several years. 

&#160; 

During 2016 we will bring to market several new products and platforms targeted at both our current install base as well as new clients. Many of these will be evident in our Investor Network brands and platforms &#8211; where we are reinventing the destination for both the professional and retail investor. We are calling it Pro&#8217;s and Joe&#8217;s. During the second quarter of 2016, we plan to release Investor Network 1.0 from beta to millions of professional and retail constituents in our dataset. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in the second quarter, the Company plans to release its real-time event scheduler for earnings calls and webcasts. Today this technology and option is not available in the market, giving us a quantifiable opportunity to gain market share through the remaining part of 2016. This earnings event subscription offering will be marketed to both corporate issuers and the investor relation firms. 

&#160; 

Acquisition Strategy 

&#160; 

We will continue to evaluate complimentary verticals and systems that we can integrate well into our current platforms. These opportunities need to be accretive and consistent with what the Company has done in the past. We value our equity and our cash reserves and have demonstrated a prudent and conservative approach in our acquisition transactions over the past several years. We will maintain our product and technology focus, so it is highly likely we will look for acquisitions in areas we currently have revenues to find bolt on platforms, technologies, and clients that will further enhance our overall market position. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

During 2016, we will continue to strengthen our brands in the market, by working aggressively to expand our new client footprint and continue to cross sell to increase ARPU. Our platform, systems and operations are built to handle growth &#8211; so with little capital or operational expense we can leverage this growth to produce further bottom line profits and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

Our global sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and expanding our current customers. We ended 2015 with a multi-tier organization; made up of Strategic Account Managers, and Account executives. We believe this structured approach is the most efficient and highly impactful way to reach new clients and also grow our current install base. Both teams are heavily compensated with commissions, all of whom have sales quotas. At the end of December 31, 2015, we employed 14 full-time equivalent sales personnel. 

&#160; 

We are on track to aggressively expand our sales headcount during 2016 both in our current markets and also in verticals where we have not typically had a sales presence. An example of one of these verticals is the press release dissemination and earnings call webcast businesses. Further, these news sales professionals will assist in leading both our Blueprint and Classify subscriptions sales. 

&#160; 

Additionally, our executive team plays a critical role in our sales process, assisting the organization and clients with new offerings, cross selling opportunities and channel development; because our organization is still relatively small, we benefit from this approach and believe this is key to our future success. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing organization has also undergone reorganization between our businesses; our newly created marketing and business development team now manages both business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing efforts. This alignment was necessary, as we get ready to release the rebranded Annual Report Service and Company Spotlight products into and with the new Investor Network. This organization is also responsible for collaborating with our sales teams on product marketing, outbound digital marketing and all social media efforts of our entire brand. 

&#160; 

T echnology 

&#160; 

We will continue to make investments in our technology, as we transition our business from a historically service-oriented business to more of a subscription cloud-based organization. In all of our offerings, quality, support, and scalability as well as the need to preserve the confidential content of our clients is of utmost importance and part of our core values. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Our industry benefits from increased regulatory requirements and the need for platforms and systems to manage these new regulations. Additionally, the industry along with cloud-based technologies have matured considerably over the past several years, whereby corporate issuers and communication professionals are seeking platforms and systems to do some if not all the work themselves. We are uniquely positioned in this new environment to benefit from software licensing and further advancements of our Disclosure Management System. 

&#160; 

The business services industry as it relates to compliance and communications is highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent service companies that provide a range of financial reporting, document management services and with a wide range of printing and technology software providers. The demands for many of our services historically have been cyclical and reliant on capital market activity. During 2015, we spent a considerable amount of time growing several new service offerings beyond our traditional compliance reporting and transaction services business. These new offerings will afford us the ability to reduce our revenue seasonality and provide a new baseline of reoccurring annualized contracts under our new subscription-based business, which are recognized over a defined period rather than as the services are performed. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains both highly fragmented and extremely competitive. The success of our products and services are generally based on price, quality and the ability to service client demands. Management has been focused on offsetting these risks relating to competition as well as the seasonality by introducing its subscription cloud-based platforms, with significantly higher margins, clear competitive advantages and scalability to withstand market and pricing pressures. 

&#160; 

We also review our operations on a regular basis to balance growth with opportunities to maximize efficiencies and support our long-term strategic goals. We believe by blending our workflow technologies with our legacy service offerings we are able to offer a comprehensive set of products and solutions to each of our clients that most competitors cannot offer today. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe we are positioned to be the public company platform of choice as a cost-effective alternative to both small regional providers and global providers. We also believe we benefit from our location in North Carolina, as we do not experience significant competition for sales, customer service, or production personnel. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our customers include a wide variety of issuers, mutual funds, law firms, brokerage firms, banks, individuals, and other institutions. We did not have any customers during the year ended December 31, 2015 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and no customer represented more than 10% of our year end accounts receivable balance. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed fifty-three full-time employees as compared to fifty-nine full-time employees at December 31, 2014, none of which are represented by a union. Our employees work in our corporate offices in North Carolina, and in remote locations throughout North America and the United Kingdom. 

&#160; 

Facilities 

&#160; 

Our headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. In October, we agreed to an extension on our current lease to extend the maturity through October 2019. Our current office includes 16,059 square feet of office space and we additionally occupy a 20,000 square foot warehouse on a month-to-month basis in the same building. We believe we have sufficient space to sustain our growth through 2019. Additionally, we also have a shared office facility in London, England. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain both a general business liability policy and an errors and omissions policy in excess of $5,000,000 specific to our industry and operations. We believe that our insurance policy provides adequate coverage for all reasonable risks associated with operating our business. Additionally, we maintain a Directors and Officers insurance policy, which is standard for our industry and size. We also maintain key man life insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and one other key individual. 

&#160; 

Regulations 

&#160; 

The securities and financial services industries generally are subject to regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Regulatory policies in the United States and the rest of the world are tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets with protecting the interests of both issuers and shareholders. 

&#160; 

In the United States, corporate issuers are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws, which often require public disclosure and regulatory filings. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formally known as NASD, and NYSE market regulations, various stock exchanges, and other self-regulatory organizations (&#8220;SRO&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In the Europe Union (EU), the securities and reporting authorities tend to be based on exchanges as well as individual country disclosure requirements. We currently work with our stock exchange partners to deliver our solutions. We believe this is the best approach as this market is highly complex and divided in comparison to our North American markets. 

&#160; 

We operate our filing agent business and transfer agent business under the direct supervision and regulations of the SEC. 

&#160; 

Our transfer agency business, Direct Transfer, LLC, is subject to certain regulations, which are governed, without limitation by the SEC, with respect to registration with the SEC, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, tax reporting and escheatment services. Our transfer agency is approved to handle the securities of NYSE, NASDAQ and the Over the Counter listed securities; as well we select issuers traded on TSX. 

&#160; 

Our mission is to assist corporate issuers with these regulations, communication and compliance of rules imposed by regulatory bodies. The majority of our business involves the distribution of content, either electronically or paper, to governing bodies and shareholders alike. We are licensed under these regulations to disseminate, communicate and or solicit on behalf of our clients, the issuers. 

&#160;
