 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Back to Table of Contents 

Formation and Background 

We were incorporated on May 26, 2010, in the State of Delaware. Our authorized capital consists of 500,000,000 shares of our common stock (the "Common Shares"), par value of $0.0001. Our principal executive offices are currently located at the following address: 40 Wall Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10005-1313. 

We were organized for the purpose of developing and marketing software for an online gaming platform and entering into licensing agreements with online game service providers world-wide. Our gaming platform enabled our customers to offer games of skill using our platform as part of their member services. During our year ended December 31, 2011, we generated revenues of approximately $93,000, virtually all of which was from the sale of a single license to one customer. During our year ended December 31, 2012, our revenues declined to approximately $6,000. This decline and our inability to successfully market our online gaming platform led our management and principal shareholders to reevaluate our business plan during 2013. As part of management's reevaluation, the Company conducted discussions with certain of its principal shareholders and other persons in Israel, during which the Company was introduced to Dr. Oded Sagee, the founder of BreedIT Ltd, organized under the laws of the State of Israel (&#34;BreedIT Israel&#34;). 

Recent Corporate Developments 

In our report on Form 8-K filed August 19, 2013, we disclosed that we had entered into a preliminary agreement (the &#34;Preliminary Agreement&#34;) with BreedIT Israel and its founder, Dr. Oded Sagee, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 66.67% of BreedIT Israel's capital stock. Subsequently, we were issued 200 shares of BreedIT Israel's capital stock (&#34;Ordinary Shares&#34;) which represent 66.67% of BreedIT's outstanding Ordinary Shares with the founder, Dr. Oded Sagee owning the remaining 100 Ordinary Shares, representing 33.33% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. 

On November 8, 2013, our board of directors authorized the filing with the State of Delaware of a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Progaming Platforms Corp. to BreedIT Corp. On January 14, 2014, Mr. Yoel Yogev, the Registrant's newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer, accepted his appointment to become a member of the Registrant's Board of directors. On February 27, 2014, the Company announced that it had successfully completed the raise of the US$1,000,000 required under its agreements with BreedIT Israel. 

On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a separation agreement with BreedIT Ltd., the Company's majority-owned subsidiary (&#34;BreedIT Israel&#34;), BreedIT Israel's founder and minority stockholder, Dr. Oded Sagee (&#34;Dr. Sagee&#34;) and Star Biotech Ltd, an Israeli company controlled by Dr. Sagee (&#34;SB&#34;). the Company and Dr. Sagee agreed to enter into the Separation Agreement based upon the determination by the Company that it had fulfilled its obligation to fund up to but not more than $1 million on behalf of BreedIT Israel but was not willing to continue to fund BreedIT Israel as a result of the financial condition and result of operations of BreedIT Israel and the estimate of future revenues presented by Dr. Sagee. The company agreed that its Equity Interest shall be diluted from sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3%) percent to nineteen (19%) percent. SB shall have the option to acquire the company's shares for the sum of $50,000 and in the event that the option is not exercised, SB shall pay the Company an amount equal to ten (10%) percent of BreedIT Israel's gross profits, for a period of three (3) years.
