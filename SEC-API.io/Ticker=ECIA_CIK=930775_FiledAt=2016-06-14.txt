 Item 1. Business

Company Overview

Encision Inc. (&#8220;Encision&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company"), a medical device company based in Boulder, Colorado, has developed and markets innovative technology that provides unprecedented outcomes and patient safety in minimally-invasive surgery. We believe that our patented Active Electrode Monitoring (AEM&#174;) Surgical Instruments are changing the marketplace for electrosurgical devices and laparoscopic instruments by providing a solution to a well-documented hazard unique to laparoscopic surgery.

We address market opportunities created by the increase in minimally-invasive surgery (&#8220;MIS&#8221;) and surgeons&#8217; use of electrosurgery devices in these procedures. The product opportunity exists in that monopolar electrosurgery instruments used in laparoscopic procedures provide excellent clinical results, but are also susceptible to causing inadvertent collateral tissue damage outside the surgeon&#8217;s field of view. The risk of unintended electrosurgical burn injury to the patient in laparoscopic surgery has been well documented. This risk poses a threat to patient safety, including the risk of death, and creates liability exposure for surgeons and hospitals, and increased and preventable readmissions. Our technology helps to reduce hospital risk and liability.

Our patented AEM technology provides surgeons with the desired tissue effects of cutting and coagulating tissue in laparoscopic procedures, while preventing stray electrosurgical energy that can cause complications and even death. AEM Surgical Instruments are equivalent to conventional instruments in size, shape, ergonomics and functionality, but they incorporate a proprietary shield and electrically connect to an Active Electrode Monitor to dynamically and continuously monitor the flow of electrosurgical current, thereby preventing patient injury from stray monopolar energy. With our &#8220;shielded and monitored&#8221; instruments, surgeons are able to perform electrosurgical procedures more safely, effectively and economically than is possible using conventional instruments.

AEM technology has been recommended and endorsed by sources from many groups involved in MIS. Surgeons, nurses, biomedical engineers, the medicolegal community, malpractice insurance carriers and electrosurgical device manufacturers advocate the use of AEM technology.

Business Highlights

Proprietary, Patented Technology

We have developed and launched patented AEM Surgical Instruments and Monitors that enhance patient safety and patient outcomes in laparoscopic surgical procedures. We have been issued 12 unexpired patents relating to AEM technology from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, each encompassing multiple claims, and which have between six and fourteen years remaining. We also have patents relating to AEM technology issued in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.

Technology Solves a Well Documented Risk in Minimally Invasive Surgery

MIS offers significant benefits for patients by reducing trauma, hospital stays, recovery times and medical costs. However, these benefits have not been achieved without the emergence of new risks. The risk of unintended tissue damage from stray electrosurgical energy has been well documented. Such injuries can be especially troubling given that often these injuries are out of the field of view, can go unrecognized at the time of surgery, and can lead to a cascade of adverse events, including death. Our patented AEM technology eliminates the risk of stray electrosurgical burns in MIS while providing surgeons with the tissue effects they desire.

&#160;

Product Line has been Developed and Launched

Our AEM Surgical Instruments and Monitors have been engineered to provide a seamless transition for surgeons switching from conventional laparoscopic instruments. AEM technology has been integrated into instruments that have the same look, feel and functionality as conventional instruments that surgeons have been using for years. The AEM product line encompasses a full range of instrument sizes, types and styles favored by surgeons. Additionally, we continued to improve quality and added our AEM EndoShield&#8482; Burn Protection System (&#8220;EndoShield&#8221;), during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. In April 2016, we launched our AEM EndoShield&#174; 2 Burn Protection System (&#8220;EndoShield 2&#8221;). The EndoShield 2 can be used for a number of surgical procedures without reprocessing, reduces the customer&#8217;s cost per use significantly, and eliminates a significant barrier to adoption. Thus, hospitals can make a complete and smooth conversion to our product line, thereby advancing patient safety in MIS.

Emerging as a Standard of Care

We believe that AEM technology is following a similar path as previous technological developments in surgery. Throughout the history of electrosurgery, companies that have developed significant technological breakthroughs in patient safety have seen their technologies become widely used. As with &#8220;Isolated&#8221; electrosurgical generators in the 1970s and with &#8220;REM&#8221; technology in the 1980s, AEM technology is receiving the broad endorsements that drove these previous new technologies to becoming a standard of care. We believe that it is possible to follow a course similar to that of pulse oximetry in becoming a standard of care. Our proprietary AEM technology enhances patient safety in MIS, especially in light of laparoscopic instruments being in closer proximity with single-port and reduced-port approaches. As a result, knowledgeable clinicians are now advocating AEM technology&#8217;s use.

Developing Distribution Network is Advancing Utilization of AEM Technology

Our AEM technology, in the hands of a sales network with broad access to the surgery marketplace, will help to increase utilization and market share. Historically, our sales and marketing efforts have been hindered by our small size and limited distribution channels. While these limitations continue, we improved our sales network which provided new hospital accounts with AEM technology in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Our supplier agreements with Group Purchasing Organizations (&#8220;GPOs&#8221;) and other key hospitals systems, such as Ascension and HPG, are beginning to expose more hospitals to the benefits of our AEM technology.

Market Overview

We believe that our patented AEM technology provides us with marketing leverage toward gaining an increased share, both in terms of penetrations, as well as increasing our impact per procedure with AEM instrumentation.

In the 1990s, surgeons began widespread use of minimally invasive surgical techniques. The benefits of MIS are substantial and include reduced trauma for the patient, reduced hospital stay, shorter recovery time and lower medical costs. With improvements in the surgical laparoscopic camera and in the variety of available instruments, laparoscopic surgery became popular among general surgeons, gynecologic surgeons and other specialties. Laparoscopy now accounts for a large percentage of all surgical procedures performed in the United States. Approximately 75% of surgeons employ monopolar electrosurgery for laparoscopy according to INTERactive SURVeys. There are over 4.4 million laparoscopic procedures performed annually in the United States, and this number is increasing annually. (Note: except as otherwise stated, market estimates in this section are as reported by Patient Safety &#38; Quality Healthcare).

A component of the endoscopic surgery products market includes laparoscopic hand instruments, including scissors, graspers, dissectors, forceps, suction/irrigation devices, clip appliers and other surgical instruments of various designs, which provide a variety of tissue effects. Among the laparoscopic hand instruments, approximately $500 million in sales annually are derived from instruments designed for "monopolar" electrosurgical utility. This market for laparoscopic monopolar electrosurgical instruments is the market we are targeting with our innovative AEM Surgical Instruments. Our proprietary AEM product line supplants the conventional &#8220;non-shielded, non-monitored&#8221; electrosurgical instruments commonly used in laparoscopic surgery.

When a hospital decides to use our AEM technology, we make recurring sales to such hospital for replacement instruments. Sales from reusable and disposable AEM products in hospitals represented over 90% of our sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and we expect this sales stream to grow as new hospitals increasingly adopt AEM technology and existing hospitals increase usage of AEM instrumentation. We also expect to increase the value per procedure delivered to our customers and, therefore, expect the dollars per procedure to increase. AEM Instruments are competitively priced compared to conventional laparoscopic instruments.

We aim to further develop the market by continuing to educate healthcare professionals about the benefits of AEM technology to advance patient safety. We are developing new devices that integrate AEM technology and will have high surgeon appeal. We are also working to improve the reach of our sales network to key decision makers who purchase or recommend the purchase of laparoscopic instruments and electrosurgical devices. We are also pursuing relationships with selected GPOs, hospital systems and integrated delivery networks to assist in promoting the benefits of AEM technology. We are seeking increasing international opportunities for AEM technology sales. We estimate sales outside the U.S. to be at least as large as that of the U.S. market. We are growing our presence in Australia and New Zealand and are seeking a new presence in the Middle East, Europe, Canada and Asia. As decisions are made at a system level, our intent is to highlight the clinical, economic and safety benefits of using AEM technology.

The Technology

Stray Electrosurgical Burn Injury to the Patient

Electrosurgical technology is a valuable and prevalent resource for surgeons. Since its introduction in the 1930s, electrosurgical technology has continually evolved and is estimated to be used in over 75% of all surgeries.

The primary form of electrosurgery, monopolar electrosurgery, is a standard tool for general surgeons throughout the world. In monopolar electrosurgery, the surgeon uses an instrument (typically scissors, grasper/dissectors, spatula blades or suction-irrigation electrodes) to deliver electrical current to patient tissue. This &#8220;active electrode&#8221; provides the surgeon with the ability to cut, coagulate or ablate tissue as needed during the surgery. With the advent of MIS procedures, surgeons have continued using monopolar electrosurgery as a primary tool for hemostatic incision, coagulation of bleeding tissues, excision and ablation. Unfortunately, conventional laparoscopic electrosurgical instruments from competing manufacturers are susceptible to emitting stray electrical currents during the procedure. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that laparoscopic camera systems limit the surgical field of view. Ninety percent of the instrument may be outside the surgeon's field of view at any given time during the surgery.

The dangers of stray energy are twofold. Not only is there the danger created by the burn injury itself, but there is the compounding danger that the burn will go unnoticed during the surgery and be allowed to manifest post-operatively as fecal peritonitis or other potentially deadly and devastating outcomes. In many cases, the surgeon cannot detect stray electrosurgical burns at the time of the procedure because it is out of their field of visualization. The resulting complication usually presents itself days later in the form of a severe infection or sepsis, which often results in a hospital readmission and a difficult course of remedial surgeries and prolonged hospital recovery for the patient. This situation has even resulted in fatalities.

Stray electrosurgical burn injury can result from two causes &#8211; instrument insulation failure and capacitive coupling. Instrument insulation failure can be a common occurrence with laparoscopic instruments. Conventional active electrodes for laparoscopic surgery are designed with the same basic construction &#8211; a single conductive element and an outer insulation coating. Unfortunately, this insulation can fail during the course of normal use during surgery. One university study found insulation defects in new disposable instruments before they were used or after limited surgical use. It is also possible for instrument insulation to become flawed during the handling, cleaning and sterilization process. This common insulation failure can allow electrical currents to "spark" from the instrument to unintended and unseen tissue with potentially serious consequences for the patient, such as bowel perforations. Four different studies indicate that the insulation failure rate in reusable instruments can be as high as one in five. Capacitive coupling is another way stray electrosurgical energy can cause unintended burns during laparoscopy. Capacitive coupling is an electrical phenomenon that occurs when current is induced from the instrument to nearby tissue or another instrument despite intact insulation. This potential for capacitive coupling is present in all laparoscopic surgeries that utilize monopolar electrosurgery devices and can likely occur outside the surgeon&#8217;s field of view.

Conventional, &#8220;non-shielded, non-monitored&#8221; laparoscopic instruments are susceptible to causing unintended, unseen burn injuries to the patient in MIS. Instrument insulation failure and capacitive coupling are the primary causes of stray electrosurgical burns in laparoscopy and are the two events over which the surgical team has traditionally had any control. Although alternative forms to monopolar electrosurgery energy exist, these alternative energies tend to be less effective, take longer to achieve the desired surgical effect and are more costly.

Encision&#8217;s AEM Surgical Instruments

Active electrode monitoring technology eliminates the risk of stray electrical energy caused by instrument insulation failure and capacitive coupling, and thus prevents unintended burn injuries to patients.

AEM Surgical Instruments are an innovative solution to stray electrosurgical burns in laparoscopic surgery and are designed with the same look, feel and functionality as conventional instruments. They direct electrosurgical energy where the surgeon desires, while continuously monitoring the current flow to prevent stray electrosurgical energy from instrument insulation failure or capacitive coupling.

Whereas conventional instruments are simply a conductive element with a layer of insulation coating, AEM Surgical Instruments have a patented, multi-layered design with a built-in &#8220;shield,&#8221; a concept much like the third-wire ground in standard electrical cords. The shield in these instruments is electrically connected and referenced back to an AEM Monitor at the electrosurgical generator. In the event of a harmful level of stray electrical energy, the monitor shuts down the power at the source, assuring patient safety. If instrument insulation failure should occur, the AEM system, while continually monitoring the instrument, immediately interrupts monopolar output from the electrosurgical generator and alerts the surgical staff. The AEM system protects against capacitive coupling by providing a neutral return path for &#8220;capacitive&#8221; electrical energy. Capacitive energy is continually drained away from the instrument and away from the patient through the protective shield built into all AEM instruments and the connected AEM Monitor.

The AEM system consists of shielded 5mm AEM Instruments and an AEM monitor. The AEM Instruments are designed to function identically to the conventional 5mm instruments that surgeons are familiar with, but with the added benefit of enhanced patient safety. Our entire line of laparoscopic instruments has the integrated AEM design and includes the full range of instruments that are common in laparoscopic surgery today. The AEM monitor is compatible with most electrosurgical generators. AEM Surgical Instruments provide enhanced patient safety, require no change in surgeon technique and are cost competitive. Thus, conversion to AEM Surgical Instruments is easy and economical.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Historical Perspective

We were organized as a Colorado corporation in 1991 and spent several years developing the AEM monitoring system and protective sheaths to adapt to conventional electrosurgical instruments. During this period, we conducted product trials and applied for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with International patent agencies. Our patents relate to the basic shielding and monitoring technologies that we incorporate into our AEM products. As of March 31, 2016, we have 12 unexpired United States patents relating to specific implementations of shielding and monitoring in instruments and continue to add patents as we further develop our proprietary technology and its applications.

As we evolved, it was clear to us that our &#8220;active electrode monitoring&#8221; technology needed to be integrated into the standard laparoscopic instrument design. As the development program proceeded, it also became apparent that the merging of electrical and mechanical engineering skills in the instrument development process for our patented, integrated electrosurgical instruments was a complex and difficult task. As a result, instruments with integrated AEM technology were not completed for several years. Prior to offering a full range of laparoscopic electrosurgical instrumentation, it was difficult for hospitals to commit to the AEM solution, as we did not have adequate comparable surgical instrument options to match surgeon demand.

With the broad array of AEM instruments now available, the surgeon has a wide choice of instrument options and does not have to change surgical technique to use our AEM products. Since conversion to AEM technology is transparent to the surgeon, hospitals can now universally convert to AEM technology, thus providing all of their laparoscopic surgery patients a higher level of safety. This development coincides with the continued expansion of independent endorsements for AEM technology. Recommendations from the malpractice insurance and medicolegal communities complement the broad clinical endorsements that AEM technology has garnered over the past few years, leading to better awareness for the benefits of the technology.

Products

We produce and market a full line of AEM Instruments, which are &#8220;shielded and monitored&#8221; to prevent stray electrosurgical burns from insulation failure and capacitive coupling. Our product line includes a broad range of endo-mechanical instruments (scissors, graspers and dissectors), fixed-tip electrodes and suction-irrigation electrodes. These AEM Instruments are available in a wide array of reusable and disposable options. Also, we have a line of handles that are used for advanced laparoscopic procedures that incorporate stiffer shafts and ergonomic features. In addition, we market an AEM monitor product line that is used in conjunction with AEM Instruments. &#160; During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we introduced our AEM EndoShield&#174; Burn Protection System. The EndoShield integrates our patented AEM technology into a disposable smart cord and eliminates the need for a separate AEM monitor. It is changing the marketplace for electrosurgical devices and laparoscopic instruments by providing a solution to a well documented hazard unique to laparascopic surgery.

Sales and Marketing Overview

We believe that AEM technology can become the standard of care in laparoscopic surgery worldwide. Our marketing efforts are focused on building awareness by providing technical education for Health Care Providers on the dangers of stray electrosurgical energy and in providing clinical and economic evidence to substantiate the value of AEM technology to Hospitals, their Staff, and their patients. We also leverage relationships with prominent Hospitals and Surgeons where AEM Technology has increased their level of patient care and improved their overall surgical outcomes.

In addition, there is increasing public interest in the reduction of medical errors and the advancement of patient safety. For example, the National Quality Forum and CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) recognize &#8220;patient death or serious disability associated with a burn incurred from any source while being cared for in a healthcare facility&#8221; as a &#8220;never-event&#8221;. We believe that the credibility and importance of our technology is complemented by this expanding public interest in advancing patient safety in new CMS Hospital Quality Metrics. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services published its Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program, effective October 1, 2014. At that time, the program began to levy as much as a 1% penalty on Medicare reimbursements on hospitals in the lower quadrant of performance for selected quality indicators, including accidental puncture and laceration (&#8220;APL&#8221;). An example of an APL includes the use of a cautery device (electrosurgery) or scissors to dissect a tissue plane that errantly causes an injury to underlying bowels.

To cost effectively expand market coverage, we focus on optimizing our distribution network comprised of direct and independent sales representatives who are managed and directed by our regional sales managers throughout the United States. In some instances, customers have recognized the patient safety risks inherent in monopolar electrosurgery and have accepted AEM technology as the way to eliminate those risks. In other instances, we have found selling the concept behind AEM technology more difficult. This difficulty is due to several factors, including the necessity to make surgeons, nurses and hospital risk managers aware of the potential for unintended electrosurgical burns (which exists when conventional instruments are used during laparoscopic monopolar electrosurgery) and the resulting increased patient injury and medicolegal liability exposure. Additionally, we must contend with the overall lack of single purchasing points in the industry (surgeons, hospital personnel, and value analysis committees have to be in substantial agreement as to the benefits of new technology), and the resulting need to make multiple sales calls on personnel with the authority to commit to hospital expenditures. Other challenges include the fact that many hospitals have exclusive contractual agreements with manufacturers of competing surgical instruments.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our goal is to optimize a network that has experience selling into the hospital operating room environment. We believe that improvement in this network offers us the best opportunity to cost effectively broaden acceptance of our product line and generate increased and recurring sales. Additionally, we are pursuing supplier agreements with the major selected GPOs, hospital systems and integrated delivery networks.

In addition to the efforts to broaden market acceptance in the United States, we have contracted with independent distributors in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain and the Netherlands to market our products internationally. We have achieved Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;ene (&#8220;CE&#8221;) marking for our products so that we may sell into the European marketplace. The CE marking indicates that a manufacturer has conformed to all of the obligations imposed by European health, safety and environmental legislation. While CE certification opens up incremental markets in Europe, our distribution options in the European marketplace are developing, and sales in international markets are small.

We believe that the expanding awareness for AEM technology through education and the improved sales network of independent representatives will provide the basis for increased sales and continuing profitable operations. However, these measures, or any others that we may adopt, may not result in increased sales or profitable operations.

Research and Development

We aim to continually expand our AEM Instrument product line to satisfy the evolving needs of surgeons. For AEM technology to fully become a standard of care, we must satisfy surgeons&#8217; preferred instrument shapes, sizes, styles and functionality with integrated AEM technology. This commitment includes expanding the styles of electrosurgical instruments available for MIS applications so that the conversion to AEM technology is transparent to surgeons and does not require significant change in their current surgical techniques. We employ full-time engineers and use independent contractors from time to time in our research and product development efforts. This group continuously explores ways to broaden and enhance the product line. Current research and development efforts are focused primarily on line-extension projects to further expand our AEM Instrument product offering to increase surgeons&#8217; choices and options in laparoscopic surgery. Our research and development expenses were $1,249,787 in fiscal year 2016 and $1,342,411 in fiscal year 2015. We expense research and development costs for products and processes as incurred. Costs that are included in research and development expenses include direct salaries, contractor fees, materials, facility costs and administrative expenses that relate to research and development.

Manufacturing, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance

We engage in various manufacturing and assembly activities at our leased facility in Boulder, Colorado. These operations include disposable scissor inserts manufacturing and assembly of our AEM Instrument system as well as fabrication, assembly and test operations for instruments, monitors and accessories. We also have relationships with a number of outside suppliers, including New Deantronics, Inc., who accounted for approximately 11% of our purchases in fiscal year 2016, who provide primary sub-assemblies, various electronic and sheet metal components, and molded parts used in our products.

We believe that the use of both internal and external manufacturing capabilities allows for increased flexibility in meeting our customer delivery requirements and significantly reduces the need for investment in specialized capital equipment. We have developed multiple sources of supply where possible. Our relationship with our suppliers is generally limited to individual purchase order agreements supplemented, as appropriate, by contractual relationships to help ensure the availability and low cost of certain products. All components, materials and sub-assemblies used in our products, whether produced in-house or obtained from others, are inspected to ensure compliance with our specifications. All finished products are subject to our quality assurance and performance testing procedures.

As discussed in the section on Government Regulation, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). Our leased facility of 28,696 square feet contains approximately 15,100 square feet of manufacturing, regulatory affairs and quality assurance space. The facility is designed to comply with the Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), as specified in published FDA regulations. Our latest inspection by the FDA occurred in December 2012.

We achieved CE marking in August 2000, which required prior certification of our quality system and product documentation. Maintenance of the CE marking status requires periodic audits of the quality system and technical documentation by our European Notified Body, LGA InterCert. The most recent audit was completed in October 2015.

Patents, Patent Applications and Intellectual Proprietary Rights

We have invested heavily in an effort to protect our valuable technology, and, as a result of this effort, we have been issued 12 unexpired relevant patents that together form a significant intellectual property position. Our patents relate to the basic shielding and monitoring technologies that we incorporate into our AEM products. As of March 31, 2016, we have 12 unexpired United States patents relating to specific implementations of shielding and monitoring in instruments. As of March 31, 2016, there are between six and fourteen years remaining on our AEM patents. We have seven patent applications in process and we have four trademarks.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our technical progress depends to a significant degree on our ability to maintain patent protection for products and processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to attempt to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology that we consider important to the development of our business. The validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. Even though we hold patented technology, others might copy our technology or otherwise incorporate our technology into their products.

We require our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements upon commencement of employment. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual's employment is our property and is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties.

Competition

The electrosurgical device market is intensely competitive and tends to be dominated by a relatively small group of large and well-financed companies. We compete directly for customers with those companies that currently make conventional electrosurgical instruments. Larger competitors include Advanced Surgical Technologies Group (a division of Medtronic plc) and Ethicon Endo-Surgery (a division of Johnson &#38; Johnson). While we know of no competitor (including those referenced above) that can provide a continuous solution to stray electrosurgical burns, the manufacturers of conventional (non-monitored, non-shielded) instruments will resist any loss of market share resulting from the presence of our products in the marketplace. What clearly differentiates us from the competition is that while competitive technologies may somewhat reduce the risk of stray energy burns, only AEM Technology completely eliminates it.

We also believe that manufacturers of products based on alternative technology to monopolar electrosurgery are our competitors. These alternative technologies include other &#8220;advanced energy&#8221; technologies such as bipolar electrosurgery, laser surgery and ultrasonic dissector sealers. Leading manufacturers in these areas include Advanced Surgical Technologies Group, Gyrus/ACMI (a division of Olympus Corporation and a leader in bi-polar electrosurgery), Lumenis (laser surgery) and Ethicon Endo-Surgery (a division of Johnson and Johnson, manufacturers of the harmonic scalpel). We believe that monopolar electrosurgery offers substantial competitive, functional and financial advantages over these alternative energy technologies and will remain the primary tool for the surgeon, as it has been for decades. However, the risk exists that these alternative technologies may gain greater market share and that new competitive techniques may be developed and introduced.

As mentioned in the Sales and Marketing discussion, the competitive issues involved in selling our AEM product line do not primarily revolve around a comparison of cost or features, but rather involve generating an awareness of the inherent hazards of electrosurgery and the potential for injury to the patient. This involves conceptual selling, rather than just product selling, which results in a longer sales cycle and generally higher sales costs. Independent endorsements of AEM technology have greatly enhanced the credibility of AEM Instruments. However, our efforts to increase market awareness of this technology may not be successful, and our competitors may develop alternative strategies and/or products to counter our marketing efforts.

Many of our competitors and potential competitors have widely-used products and significantly greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources. In addition to our direct sales force, we utilize a network of independent distributor representatives in selected areas. In some cases, our options for independent distribution have conflicting and competing product interests which compromise our ability to make market advances in certain areas. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Government Regulation

Government regulation in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development and marketing of our products and in our ongoing manufacturing, research and development activities. The FDA regulates us and our products under a number of statutes, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the &#8220;FDC Act&#8221;). Under the FDC Act, medical devices are classified as Class I, II or III on the basis of the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to the least extensive controls, as their safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured through general controls (e.g., labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to QSR). For Class II devices, safety and effectiveness can be assured through the use of special controls (e.g., performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidelines). Class III devices (e.g., life-sustaining or life-supporting implantable devices or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices) require the highest level of control, generally requiring pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Our products are Class II devices.

If a manufacturer or distributor of medical devices can establish that a proposed device is "substantially equivalent" to a legally marketed Class I or Class II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not required a pre-market approval application, the manufacturer or distributor may seek FDA marketing clearance for the device by filing a 510(k) pre-market notification. Following submission of the 510(k) notification, the manufacturer or distributor may not place the device into commercial distribution in the United States until an order has been issued by the FDA. The FDA's target for issuing such orders is within 90 days of submission, but the process can take significantly longer. The order may declare the FDA's determination that the device is "substantially equivalent" to another legally marketed device and allow the proposed device to be marketed in the United States. The FDA may, however, determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent or may require further information, such as additional test data, before making a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Any adverse determination or request for additional information could delay market introduction and have a material adverse effect on our continued operations. We have received a favorable 510(k) notification for our AEM monitors and AEM Instruments, all of which are designated as Class II medical devices.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA also imposes post-marketing controls on us and our products, and registration, listing, medical device reporting, post-market surveillance, device tracking and other requirements on medical devices. Failure to meet these pervasive FDA requirements or adverse FDA determinations regarding our clinical and preclinical trials could subject us and/or our employees to injunction, prosecution, civil fines, seizure or recall of products, prohibition of sales or suspension or withdrawal of any previously granted approvals, which could lead to a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

The FDA regulates our quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring us and our contract manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with the QSR as specified in published FDA regulations. The FDA requires manufacturers to register with the FDA, which subjects them to periodic FDA inspections of manufacturing facilities. If violations of applicable regulations are noted during FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities or the facilities of our contract manufacturers, the continued marketing of our products may be adversely affected. Such regulations are subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations. In October 2015, the FDA conducted a QSR inspection of our facilities. We believe that we have the internal resources and processes in place to be reasonably assured that we are in compliance with all applicable United States regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices. However, if we were found not to be in compliance with the QSR, in the future, such findings could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Sales of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to United States export requirements and foreign regulatory requirements. Legal restrictions on the sale of imported medical devices vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. Our Certificate of Export from the United States Department of Health and Human Services has expired and we will seek to renew it. However, a specific foreign country in which we wish to sell our products may not accept or continue to accept the Certificate of Export. Entry into the European Economic Area market also requires prior certification of our quality system and product documentation. We achieved CE marking in August 2000, allowing a launch into the European marketplace. Maintenance of the CE marking status requires annual audits of the quality system and technical documentation by our European Notified Body, TUV Rheinland. The most recent audit was completed in October 2015. In addition to licensing, entry into the Canadian market now requires quality system certification to ISO 13485:2003. Our quality system was audited in 2015 and recertification was granted in January 2016, and certification verified by TUV Rheinland.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

From time to time we receive materials returned from customers, sales representatives and other sources which are potentially biologically hazardous. These materials are segregated, and disposed of in accordance with specific procedures that minimize potential exposure to employees. The costs of compliance with these procedures are not significant. Our operations, in general, do not involve the use of environmentally sensitive materials.

Insurance

We are covered under comprehensive general liability insurance policies, which have per occurrence and aggregate limits of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and a $10 million umbrella policy. We maintain customary property and casualty, workers&#8217; compensation, employer liability and other commercial insurance policies.
