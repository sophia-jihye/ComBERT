 Item 1. Business 

Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and currently owns direct or partial interests in 318 shopping centers, the majority of which are grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers. Our centers are located in the top markets of 27 states and the District of Columbia, and contain 38.0 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). Our pro-rata share of this GLA is 28.4 million square feet. All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its co-investment partnerships. 

Our mission is to be the best-in-class grocery-anchored shopping center owner and developer through: 

&#8226; 

First-rate performance of our exceptionally merchandised and located national portfolio; 

&#8226; 

Value-enhancing services of the best team of professionals in the business; and 

&#8226; 

Creation of superior growth in shareholder value. 

Our strategy is to: 

&#8226; 

Sustain average annual 3% net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers; 

&#8226; 

Develop new, and redevelop existing, high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program; 

&#8226; 

Cost-effectively enhance our already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns; and 

&#8226; 

Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry with respect to development and operating capabilities, customer relationships, operating and technology systems, and environmental sustainability. 

We expect to execute our strategy as follows: 

Sustain average annual 3% NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers: 

&#8226; 

Own and develop centers that are located at key corners in our nation&#8217;s most attractive metro areas; 

&#8226; 

Target trade areas characterized by their strong demographics and consumer buying power, and draw shoppers to our centers with highly productive anchor tenants; 

&#8226; 

Attract the best national, regional and local retailers and restaurants; 

&#8226; 

Pursue initiatives that reinforce the underlying quality of our portfolio and maximize long-term growth such as &#8220;Fresh Look&#174;,&#8221; an operating philosophy that guides our merchandising and place-making programs; 

&#8226; 

Fortify future NOI growth by rigorously reviewing our portfolio to identify low growth assets for disposition; and 

&#8226; 

Opportunistically upgrade our portfolio by acquiring high quality shopping centers with meaningful upside in NOI growth funded from the sale of low growth assets. 

Develop new, and redevelop existing, high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program: 

&#8226; 

Maintain and grow our existing presence in our key markets with in-house expertise and anchor relationships; 

&#8226; 

Develop shopping centers located in desirable infill markets for long-term ownership; 

&#8226; 

Anchor developments with dominant, national and regional chains and high volume specialty grocers; 

&#8226; 

Limit size of program to manage total development exposure and risk; 

&#8226; 

Create additional value through redevelopment of existing centers to benefit the operating portfolio; and 

&#32;1 

&#8226; 

Fund development program primarily from the sale of low-growth assets in the existing portfolio. 

Cost-effectively enhance an already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns: 

&#8226; 

Prudently access our multiple sources of debt and equity through the capital markets and co-investment partnerships; 

&#8226; 

Fund development and acquisitions from free cash flow, a disciplined match-funding strategy of selling low growth assets, and accessing favorably priced equity; 

&#8226; 

Further reduce leverage when appropriate through organic growth in earnings and accessing the capital markets; 

&#8226; 

Rigorously manage our $800 million line of credit and maintain substantial uncommitted capacity; 

&#8226; 

Maintain a large pool of unencumbered assets and excellent relationships with mortgage lenders; and 

&#8226; 

Maintain a well laddered debt maturity profile. 

Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry with respect to development and operating capabilities, customer relationships, operating and technology systems, and environmental sustainability: 

&#8226; 

Reflect our values by executing and successfully meeting our commitments to our people and our communities, a tradition we have embraced for over 50 years; 

&#8226; 

Foster a values-based culture, offering a comprehensive benefits package and an engaging workplace environment; 

&#8226;

Encourage employees to achieve their personal health goals through a robust wellness program focused on education, awareness and prevention; and 

&#8226; 

Contribute to the betterment of our communities by supporting philanthropic programs with employee contribution matching and paid volunteer time. 

&#160; 

Environmental Sustainability 

We recognize the importance of operating in a sustainable manner and are committed to reducing our environmental impact, including energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to increase disclosure using industry accepted reporting frameworks. We believe our commitment to environmental sustainability supports the Company in achieving key strategic objectives, leads to better risk management, enhances our relationships with key stakeholders, and is in the best interest of our shareholders. 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, gross leasable area ("GLA"), and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers. This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites. We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by: 

&#8226; 

our locations within our market areas; 

&#8226; 

the design and high quality of our shopping centers; 

&#8226; 

the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers; 

&#8226; 

our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers; 

&#8226; 

our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to source and develop new shopping centers. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. We presently maintain 18 market offices nationwide, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities. We have 371 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#32;2 

&#160; Compliance with Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities for remediation.

Defined Terms 

&#160; 

The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results: 

&#8226; 

Net Operating Income ("NOI") &#32;is calculated as total property revenues (minimum rent, percentage rents, and recoveries from tenants and other income) less direct property operating expenses (operating and maintenance and real estate taxes) from the properties owned by us, and excludes corporate-level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), for the entirety of the periods presented. 

&#8226; 

Same Property &#32;information is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared and excludes Non-Same Properties and Properties in Development. 

&#8226; 

A Non-Same Property is a property acquired, sold, or development property completed during either calendar year period being compared. 

&#8226; 

Property In Development &#32;is a property owned and intended to be developed, including partially operating properties acquired specifically for redevelopment and excluding land held for future development. 

&#8226; 

Development Completion &#32;is a project in development that is deemed complete upon the earliest of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) percent leased equals or exceeds 90% and the project features at least one year of anchor operations, or (iii) the project features at least two years of anchor operations, or (iv) three years have passed since the start of construction. Once deemed complete, the property is termed an Operating Property. 

&#8226; 

Same Property NOI includes NOI for Same Properties, but excludes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, banking charges, and other fees. Same Property NOI is a key measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our properties. The Company also provides disclosure of Same Property NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses. 

&#8226; 

Pro-Rata &#32;information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships. 

&#8226; 

NAREIT Funds from Operations ("NAREIT FFO") &#32;is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for cash flow as a measure of liquidity. 

&#8226; 

Core FFO &#32;is an additional performance measure used by Regency as the computation of NAREIT FFO includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance. Core FFO excludes from NAREIT FFO, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to Core FFO.
