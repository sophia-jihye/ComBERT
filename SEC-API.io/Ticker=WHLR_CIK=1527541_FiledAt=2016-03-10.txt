 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers. Our strategy is to opportunistically acquire and reinvigorate well-located, potentially dominant retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. We target competitively protected properties in communities that have stable demographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends, such as strong population and income growth. We generally lease our properties to national and regional retailers that offer consumer goods and generate regular consumer traffic. We believe our tenants carry goods that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers&#8217; disposable income, generating more predictable property level cash flows. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we own a portfolio consisting of fifty-three &#32;properties, including thirty-nine &#32;retail shopping centers and three &#32;freestanding retail properties totaling 3,151,358 &#32;gross leasable square feet of which approximately 94% &#32;are leased (our "operating portfolio"), one &#32;office property and ten &#32;undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 81 acres. We believe the current market environment creates a substantial number of favorable investment opportunities in our target markets with attractive yields on investment and significant upside potential in terms of income and gain. 

We have 59 full-time and 2 part-time employees. Our management team has experience and capabilities across the real estate sector with experience in the aggregate and expertise particularly in the retail asset class, which we believe provides for flexibility in pursuing attractive acquisition, development and repositioning opportunities. Because varying market conditions create opportunities at different times across the retail property sector, we believe our expertise enables us to target relatively more attractive investment opportunities throughout economic cycles. In addition, our fully integrated platform with in-house development capabilities allows us to pursue development and redevelopment projects with multiple uses. We believe that our ability to pursue these types of opportunities differentiates us from many competitors in our markets. 

Our executive officers and the members of the management team have extensive experience in all aspects of the commercial real estate industry, specifically in our target/existing markets. Jon S. Wheeler, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has over thirty-four years of experience in the real estate sector with particular experience in strategic financial and market analyses and assessments of new or existing properties to maximize returns. Mr. Wheeler has overseen the acquisition of over seventy properties. Wilkes J. Graham became our Chief Financial Officer in January 2016. Prior to joining us, Wilkes spent 16 years in the real estate financial services industry. Since 2010 Mr. Graham worked with Compass Point Research &#38; Trading, LLC (&#8220;Compass Point&#8221;), an independent, full-service investment firm focused exclusively on the financial services sector, where he served as Director of Research and as a Senior Sell-Side Equity Research Analyst. Steven M. Belote was our Chief Financial Officer from August 2011 until January 2016, and is now our Chief Operating Officer. Prior to joining us, Mr. Belote was the Chief Financial Officer of Shore Bank for fifteen years. As Chief Financial Officer of Shore Bank, he played an integral role in their initial public offering. Prior to Shore Bank, Mr. Belote spent seven years in public accounting. David Kelly, our Senior Vice President and Director of Acquisitions, has over twenty-five years of experience in the real estate industry. Prior to joining us, he served for thirteen years as the Director of Real Estate for Supevalu, Inc., a Fortune 100 supermarket retailer. While at Supervalu, he focused on site selection and acquisitions from New England to the Carolinas, completing transactions totaling over $500 million. Jeff Parker is our Director of Leasing. Mr. Parker is responsible for leasing operations over our growing portfolio of commercial assets. Prior to joining us, Mr. Parker served as Real Estate Portfolio Manager for the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States for Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. While at Dollar Tree, Mr. Parker was responsible for a portfolio of over 1,100 stores and created many key relationships throughout the industry. Prior to Dollar Tree, Mr. Parker spent ten years handling the leasing and sale of commercial properties for CB Richard Ellis of Virginia, Inc. 

Business Objectives and Investment Strategy 

Our primary business objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders by increasing cash flows at our existing properties and acquiring additional properties with attractive yields below replacement cost. We intend to achieve this objective utilizing the following investment strategy: 

&#8226; 

Focus on necessity-based retail . We intend to invest in retail properties that serve the essential day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding communities. These necessity-based centers attract high levels of daily traffic resulting in cross-selling of goods and services from our tenants. The majority of our tenants provide non-cyclical consumer goods and services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the economy. According to the Food Marketing Institute, the average consumer in the US makes a trip to a grocery store 2.2 times per week. We believe targeting centers that provide essential goods and services such as groceries results in a stable, lower-risk portfolio of retail investment properties. 

&#8226; 

Target secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographics and demand . We believe these markets have limited competition from institutional buyers and relatively low levels of new construction. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we focus on areas with strong demographics such as population density, population growth, tenant sales trends and growth in household income, and we seek to identify properties in locations where there is a need for necessity-based retail and limited new supply. We generally will seek to avoid markets where we believe potential yields have decreased as a result of acquisition activity from institutional buyers. 

&#8226; 

Acquire properties that are the number one or number two centers in their respective markets . After we identify an attractive target market, we look to acquire the top center in that market. These centers will have anchor tenants with dominant market share, high sales per square feet, significant capital invested in their respective stores and limited proximity to competing centers. 

&#8226; 

Increase operating income through leasing strategies and expense management . We employ intensive lease management strategies to optimize occupancy. Management has strong expertise in acquiring and managing under-performing properties and increasing operating income through more effective leasing strategies and expense management such as common area maintenance, or CAM reimbursement and experience utilizing exterior parking for build to suit outparcels or pad sales. Our leases generally require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, and managing the shopping center and the common areas, along with the associated insurance costs and real estate taxes. Operating expenses that qualify for CAM reimbursement include, but are not limited to, landscaping, parking field maintenance and repairs, building maintenance and repairs, utilities and their associated maintenance and repair within the shopping center. The amount that each tenant pays is determined on a pro-rata basis and our leases generally allow us to add an administrative fee of 15%. Some leases are structured such that there is a price per square foot cap on paying additional fees and charges. Additionally, in some cases the tenant is either fully or partially responsible for all maintenance of the property, thereby limiting our obligations towards maintaining the center and increasing our net income. We refer to this arrangement as a &#8220;triple net lease.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Selectively utilize our capital to improve retail properties. We intend to make capital investments where the return on such capital is accretive to our shareholders. We have significant expertise allocating capital to value-added improvements of retail properties to increase rents, extend long-term leases with anchor tenants and increasing occupancy. We will selectively allocate capital to revenue enhancing projects that we believe will improve the market position of a given property. 

&#8226; 

Selectively utilize our development capabilities for third parties. We intend to invest capital in development and re-development opportunities where we believe the return on such capital is accretive to our shareholders. We believe our experience in development will benefit us by providing opportunities to either develop properties for us at higher cap rates that result in positive returns to our operations or to develop for third parties which will result in development fee income for us. While this objective is not always possible, we generally want a development project to be at least 50% pre-leased prior to commencement. 

&#8226; 

Acquire properties that meet our strict underwriting guidelines and process. Initially, our underwriting process begins with a cursory review of the asset to determine if there is a fit with our acquisition criteria. The offering memorandum; seller&#8217;s financials; lease abstracts (anchor and small shop); rent roll; delinquency reports; assumable debt, if any; tenant sales reports; and the general physical structure of the asset are reviewed. By analyzing the trade 

area we can determine trade area demographics, how the target asset sits within the trade area compared to its competition and how that trade area is currently being serviced by the existing retail base. Provided the cursory review of the target asset is satisfactory we begin the primary underwriting. The acquisition analyst develops an eleven year cash flow analysis using Argus software utilizing lease abstracts, rent roll, financials provided by seller, and historical data from our own portfolio. Lease administration reviews the third-party abstracts of all leases giving particular attention to use restrictions/conflicts, lease termination rights, relocation rights and accuracy against the provided rent roll. Tenant interviews are done with all key tenants per a multi-point checklist. The property is reviewed internally by leasing, asset management and property management departments. Third party reports are generated for environmental, zoning, appraisal and property condition assessment. Legal reviews newly produced survey and title binder. Discussions are held with the local municipality, particularly economic development, zoning and planning to determine potential competitive activity, changes in traffic patterns and possible real estate tax exposure. Lastly, an on-site review of the asset by representatives of the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors, Mr. Wheeler, and Mr. Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Acquisitions, is required before the due diligence portion of any contract closes. In all, a checklist of over 100 items is reviewed and signed off prior to moving into the closing phase of the contract. 

Policies With Respect to Certain Activities 

&#160; 

The following is a discussion of certain of our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our board of directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. 

Investment Policies 

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 

We will conduct all of our investment activities through our Operating Partnership, Wheeler REIT, L.P., and its subsidiaries. Our investment objectives are to maximize the cash flow of our properties, acquire properties with cash flow growth potential, provide monthly cash distributions and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders through increases in the value of our company. Consistent with our policy to acquire assets for both income and capital gain, our Operating Partnership intends to hold its properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring, developing and owning its properties and to make occasional sales of the properties as are consistent with our investment objectives. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. 

We expect to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership by our Operating Partnership of our portfolio of properties and other acquired properties and assets. We currently intend to invest primarily in retail properties. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to any geographic area, property type or to a specified percentage of our assets. While we may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area. We intend to engage in such future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the properties we presently own or other acquired properties, or sell such properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. 

We may also participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. We also may acquire real estate or interests in real estate in exchange for the issuance of common stock, units, preferred stock or options to purchase stock. These types of investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting our diversification and, therefore, provide us with flexibility in structuring our portfolio. We will not, however, enter into a joint venture or other partnership arrangement to make an investment that would not otherwise meet our investment policies. 

Equity investments in acquired properties may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness which may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to fall within the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 

&#160; 

We do not intend presently or at any time in the future to invest in real estate mortgages. 

&#160; 

Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers 

&#160; 

Although not presently contemplated, subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and the income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may in the future invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers where such investment would be consistent with our investment objectives. We may invest in the debt or equity securities of such entities, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We have no current plans to invest in entities that are not engaged in real estate activities. While we may attempt to diversify our investments with respect to the retail properties owned by such entities, in terms of property locations, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one entity, property or geographic area. Our investment objectives are to maximize cash flow of our investments, acquire investments with growth potential and provide cash distributions and long-term capital appreciation to our stockholders through increases in the value of our company. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. We will not underwrite the securities of any other issuers and will limit our investment in such securities so that we will not fall within the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the 1940 Act. 

Investments in Other Securities 

&#160; 

Other than as described above, we do not currently intend to invest in any additional securities such as bonds, preferred stocks or common stock, although we reserve the right to do so if our board of directors determines that such action would be in our best interests. 

Dispositions 

We disposed of the following free-standing properties in 2015: Harps, Jenks Reasor&#8217;s and Bixby Commons. Further, the following free-standing properties are currently listed for sale: Starbucks/Verizon and the Ruby Tuesday/Outback Steakhouse ground leases at Pierpont Centre. The sale and intended sale of these free-standing properties reflects the execution of our strategy of acquiring multi-tenant properties, monetizing core-assets and using proceeds to re-invest in our specialized markets. We may dispose of additional properties based upon management&#8217;s periodic review of our portfolio, and the determination by our board of directors that such activity would be in our best interest. The tax consequences to our directors and executive officers that hold common units resulting from a proposed disposition of a property may influence their decision as to the desirability of such proposed disposition. 

Financings and Leverage Policy 

&#160; 

In the future, we anticipate using a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations, including cash flows from operations, asset sales, seller financing, issuance of debt securities, private financings (such as additional bank credit facilities, which may or may not be secured by our assets), property-level mortgage debt, common or preferred equity issuances or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. Any debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. We also may take advantage of joint venture or other partnering opportunities as such opportunities arise in order to acquire properties that would otherwise be unavailable to us. We may use the proceeds of our borrowings to acquire assets, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. 

Although we are not required by our governing documents to maintain a ratio of debt to total market capitalization at any particular level, our Board of Directors will review our ratio of debt to total capital on a quarterly basis, with the goal of maintaining a reasonable rate consistent with our expected ratio of debt to total market capitalization going forward. Additionally, we intend, when appropriate, to employ prudent amounts of leverage and to use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of assets, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. We expect to use leverage conservatively, assessing the appropriateness of new equity or debt capital based on market conditions, including prudent assumptions regarding future cash flow, the creditworthiness of tenants and future rental rates. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Our board of directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of debt that we may incur. 

Our board of directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating the amount of debt that we may incur. If we adopt a debt policy, our board of directors may from time to time modify such policy in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at our discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use. 

Lending Policies 

We have not made any loans to third parties, although we do not have a policy limiting our ability to make loans to other persons. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties where the provision of that financing will increase the value to be received by us for the property sold. We also may make loans to joint ventures in which we participate. However, we do not intend to engage in significant lending activities. Any loan we make will be consistent with maintaining our status as a REIT. 

Equity Capital Policies 

To the extent that our board of directors approve additional capital raises, we may issue debt or equity securities, including additional units or senior securities of our Operating Partnership, retain earnings (subject to provisions in the Code requiring distributions of income to maintain REIT qualification) or pursue a combination of these methods. As long as our Operating Partnership is in existence, we will generally contribute the proceeds of all equity capital raised by us to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in our Operating Partnership, which will dilute the ownership interests of the limited partners in our Operating Partnership. 

Existing stockholders will have no preemptive rights to common or preferred stock or units issued in any securities offering by us, and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder&#8217;s investment in us. Although we have no current plans to do so, we may in the future issue shares of common stock or units in connection with acquisitions of property. 

We may, under certain circumstances, purchase shares of our common stock or other securities in the open market or in private transactions with our stockholders, provided that those purchases are approved by our board of directors. Our board of directors has no present intention of causing us to repurchase any shares of our common stock or other securities, and any such action would only be taken in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the applicable requirements for qualification as a REIT. 

Change in Investment and Financing Objectives and Policies 

&#160; 

Our investment policies and objectives and the methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except to the extent set forth in our charter, may be altered by our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders. If we change these policies during the offering period, we will disclose these changes in a prospectus supplement prior to the effective time of these changes. If we change these policies after the offering, we will inform our stockholders of the change within ten days after our board of directors alters our investment objectives and policies, by either a press release or notice of an &#8220;other event&#8221; on a Current Report on Form 8-K or another method deemed reasonable by our board of directors. 

Conflict of Interest Policies 

&#160; 

Overview. &#32;Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, have fiduciary duties and obligations to our Operating Partnership and its other partners under Virginia law and the Partnership Agreement in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our fiduciary duties and obligations, as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company. 

Under Virginia law (where our Operating Partnership is formed), a general partner of a Virginia limited partnership has fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its partners and must discharge its duties and exercise its rights as general partner under the Partnership Agreement or Virginia law consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The duty of loyalty requires a general partner of a Virginia general partnership to account to the partnership and hold as trustee 

for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the general partner in the conduct of the partnership business or derived from a use by the general partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity, to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership&#8217;s business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership and to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business, although the Partnership Agreement may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty. The Partnership Agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of our Operating Partnership or any partner, on the one hand, and the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, on the other hand, we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, are under no obligation not to give priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, and that any action or failure to act on our part or on the part of our directors that gives priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders that does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership under its Partnership Agreement does not violate the duty of loyalty that we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, owe to the Operating Partnership and its partners. The duty of care requires a general partner to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, and this duty may not be unreasonably reduced by the Partnership Agreement. 

The Partnership Agreement provides that we are not liable to our Operating Partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by our Operating Partnership or any limited partner, except for liability for our intentional harm or gross negligence. The Partnership Agreement also provides that any obligation or liability in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership that may arise at any time under the Partnership Agreement or any other instrument, transaction or undertaking contemplated by the Partnership Agreement will be satisfied, if at all, out of our assets or the assets of our Operating Partnership only, and no obligation or liability of the general partner will be personally binding upon any of our directors, stockholders, officers, employees or agents, regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract, tort or otherwise, and none of our directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the partnership, any partner or any assignee of a partner for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or any act or omission. Our Operating Partnership must indemnify us, our directors and officers, officers of our Operating Partnership and any other person designated by us against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys&#8217; fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, unless (1) an act or omission of the person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) for any transaction for which such person actually received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the Partnership Agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful. 

Our Operating Partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation of the person&#8217;s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that the person did not meet the standard of conduct for indemnification. Our Operating Partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action initiated by the person seeking indemnification without our approval (except for any proceeding brought to enforce such person&#8217;s right to indemnification under the Partnership Agreement) or if the person is found to be liable to our Operating Partnership on any portion of any claim in the action. 

No reported decision of a Virginia appellate court has interpreted provisions similar to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement of our Operating Partnership that modify or reduce the fiduciary duties and obligations of a general partner or reduce or eliminate our liability for money damages to the Operating Partnership and its partners, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability of the provisions set forth in the Partnership Agreement that purport to modify or reduce our fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the Partnership Agreement. 

Sale or Refinancing of Properties. &#32;Upon the sale of certain of the properties to be owned by us, certain unitholders could incur adverse tax consequences which are different from the tax consequences to us and to holders of our common stock. Consequently, unitholders may have differing objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of indebtedness. 

While we will have the exclusive authority under the Partnership Agreement to determine whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property or when to refinance or repay indebtedness, any such decision would require the approval of our board of directors. 

Policies Applicable to All Directors and Officers. &#32;Our charter and bylaws do not restrict any of our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a pecuniary interest in an investment or transaction that we have an interest in or from conducting, for their own account, business activities of the type we conduct. We intend, however, to adopt policies that are designed to eliminate or minimize potential conflicts of interest, including a policy for the review, approval or ratification of any related party transactions. This policy will provide that the audit committee of our board of directors will review the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm&#8217;s length dealings with an unrelated third party before approving such transaction. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, which provides that all of our directors, officers and employees are prohibited from taking for themselves opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position without our consent. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating the influence of such conflicts, and if they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all stockholders. 

Interested Director and Officer Transactions 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law (&#8220;MGCL&#8221;), a contract or other transaction between us and a director or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or interest, the presence of such director at the meeting at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the director&#8217;s vote in favor thereof, provided that: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of directors or a committee of our board, and our board or such committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; 

&#8226; 

the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares owned of record or beneficially by the interested director or corporation, firm or other entity; or 

&#8226; 

the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized, ratified or approved. 

Furthermore, under Virginia law, we, as general partner, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to our Operating Partnership and its partners and, consequently, such transactions also are subject to the duties that we, as general partner, owe to the Operating Partnership and its limited partners (as such duty has been modified by the Partnership Agreement). We have adopted a policy that requires that all contracts and transactions between us, our Operating Partnership or any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors or executive officers or any entity in which such director or executive officer is a director or has a material financial interest, on the other hand, must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of our disinterested directors even if less than a quorum. Where appropriate, in the judgment of the disinterested directors, our board of directors may obtain a fairness opinion or engage independent counsel to represent the interests of non-affiliated security holders, although our board of directors will have no obligation to do so. 

Policies With Respect To Other Activities 

We have authority to offer common stock, preferred stock or options to purchase stock in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise acquire our common stock or other securities in the open market or otherwise, and we may engage in such activities in the future. We expect, but are not obligated, to issue common stock to holders of common units upon exercise of their redemption rights. Our board of directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock and authorize us to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, in one or more series, including senior securities, in any manner, and on the terms and for the consideration, it deems appropriate. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers other than our Operating Partnership and do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Code, or the Treasury regulations, our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. In addition, we intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 

Reporting Policies 

We make available to our stockholders our annual reports, including our audited consolidated financial statements. We are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to those requirements, we will be required 

to file annual and periodic reports, proxy statements and other information, including audited consolidated financial statements, with the SEC.
