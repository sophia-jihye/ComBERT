Our Business 

&#160;

Tautachrome operates in the internet applications space, a space uniquely able to embrace fast growing and novel business. The iPhone, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Android, Uber and numerous other examples are reminders of the ability of the internet applications space to surprise us with the arrival of wholly new business universes seemingly from out of nowhere. 

&#160;

Tautachrome is currently pursuing three avenues of business activity: 

&#160;

1. KlickZie technology-based business development and monetization, our high focus flagship activity to revolutionize smartphone-based picture and video interaction on the web

1. KlickZie technology-based business activity 

&#160;

Tautachrome's patent pending KlickZie technology addresses two major new needs of the internet age. The first is the need for a way to trust the pictures and videos you see on the web . Right now the trillions of pictures and frames of video on the web are so easily and so often falsified that you can't trust any of it. There is a giant need for a universally available, downloadable system that turns the everyday pictures and videos we take from our smartphones into something that is completely trustable to any third party seeing it. With such a system two kinds of imagery will suddenly appear on the web: On the one hand imagery whose trustworthiness everybody can be absolutely certain of, and on the other hand all the rest of the imagery which nobody has any idea of its trust worthiness. The KlickZie system aims to satisfy this fundamental need for universal trustability. 

&#160; Solving the need for trustability also solves a more subtle need that opens the door to an enormous new opportunity. This is the need for people to be able to use pictures and videos on the web to readily and safely interact with each other via the imagery itself . it is frequently the case that when you run across interesting imagery on the web you won't know anything about it, including who the author is, who else may have seen it, or what others may think or know about it. By allowing people to interact with interesting or important pictures or videos by using the imagery itself as the portal of communication, the system can add the viewpoints and the information offerings of interacting people to the richness of the pictures and videos. This can be carried by the system into the future along with the imagery, as an evolving tapestry of interaction and imagery. 

&#160;

How KlickZie technology works: The KlickZie Activation Platform Consumers will download KlickZie's free camera upgrade software into their mobile device (iPhone, Android or other smartphone) which thereafter activates the pictures and videos taken by their device using proprietary KlickZie technology. Behind the scenes, the powerful and secure KlickZie software will capture the imagery and all available metadata related to the imaging event, and mark the imagery and its metadata with advanced, highly undetectable KlickZie watermarking technology. 

&#160;

KlickZie Activation KlickZie activation adds a new world of usefulness to ordinary pictures and videos. People who come across an activated picture can communicate with the author of the picture, or with amenable others who have seen the picture or with the data stored in the picture by merely clicking or touching the picture ("touch-to-comm"). The picture itself makes the communication happen. It does not matter where or how you come across an activated picture, you can engage it, interact with it, or share it, just by touching or clicking it. 

&#160;

What happens to an activated picture from its creation onward gets invisibly added to the picture's data and can be tracked into the future. Activated pictures can answer many questions. For example, in a group photo you could ask: Have any of the people in my contacts list interacted with this picture? Are any of them engaging it right now? Who else besides my contacts have already engaged this picture in some way? Who took it? Where? When? 

&#160;

KlickZie's activated pictures and videos will also possess the power to be completely trustable in the sense that any third party can be absolutely confident of the authenticity of the imagery because KlickZie pictures and videos will be secured in the KlickZie cloud at their creation where they remain until their creator or owner deletes them. 

&#160;

The upshot is that activation allows effective touch to comm with the authors and viewers of smartphone pictures and videos from every source, and activated pictures and videos can be completely trusted imagery. &#160;

&#160; &#160; Competition 

&#160; 

With regard to the internet applications in general, competition is intense. For example, according to Statista by mid-2015 there were more than three million different smartphone applications available to users. In spaces that are this crowded t he principal matter of competition is about capturing user mind space, which for a given product consists of elements such as degree of product exposure to users, degree of product apparent desirability, pleasure of product usage, and persisting necessity for the product in a user's life. These elements of competition are well known to our competitors which include the internet giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom have financial resources and operating staffs substantially larger than those of the Company, and all of whom can focus on the optimization of their products towards the same consumer and business arenas upon which we intend to focus. 

&#160;

With regard to KlickZie's technology for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there are many firms who mark, store and track digital imagery. Among these are Digimarc, BatchPhoto, and hirdlight who market such processes for purposes of protecting intellectual property. Although to our knowledge no firm is turning the smartphone into a generally trustable imager or advanced image-based communicator as envisioned here, which requires substantially more talent and development activity than required for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there is nothing stopping any firm, particularly the internet giants, from entering into similar activity.
