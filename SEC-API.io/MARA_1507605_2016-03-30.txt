 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name Verve Ventures, Inc. On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to American Strategic Minerals Corporation and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. In June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In October 2012, we discontinued our real estate business when our CEO joined the firm and we commenced our current business, at which time the Company&#146;s name was changed to Marathon Patent Group, Inc. 

&#160; 

We acquire patents and patent rights from owners or other ventures and seek to monetize the value of the patents through litigation and licensing strategies, alone or with others. Part of our acquisition strategy is to acquire or invest in patents and patent rights that cover a wide-range of subject matter which allows us to seek the benefits of a diversified portfolio of assets in differing industries and countries. Generally, the patents and patent rights that we seek to acquire have large identifiable targets who are or have been using technology that we believe infringes our patents and patent rights. We generally monetize our portfolio of patents and patent rights by entering into license discussions, and if that is unsuccessful, initiating enforcement activities against any infringing parties with the objective of entering into comprehensive settlement and license agreements that may include the granting of non-exclusive retroactive and future rights to use the patented technology, a covenant not to sue, a release of the party from certain claims, the dismissal of any pending litigation and such other terms as we deem appropriate. Our strategy has been developed with the expectation that it will result in a long-term, diversified revenue stream for the Company. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 327 U.S. and foreign patents and patent rights and 12 patent applications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our principal office is located at 11100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 380, Los Angeles, CA 90225. Our telephone number is (703) 232-1701. Our internet address is www.marathonpg.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Under U.S. law, an inventor or patent owner has the right to seek to exclude others from making, selling or using their patented invention and to seek damages for infringement. Unfortunately, it is often the case that infringers are unwilling, at least initially, to negotiate or pay reasonable royalties for their unauthorized use of patents and some prefer to contest allegations of patent infringement. Inventors and/or patent holders, without sufficient legal, financial and/or expert technical resources to commence or continue legal action are at a disadvantage as they may be perceived to lack credibility in dealing with potential licensees and as a result, are often ignored. As a result of the common reluctance of patent infringers to negotiate and ultimately obtain a patent license for the use of patented technologies, patent licensing and enforcement often begins with the filing of patent enforcement litigation. However, the majority of patent infringement litigations settle out of court based on the strength of the patent claims, validity, and persuasive evidence and clarity that the patent is being infringed. 

&#160; 

Business Model and Strategy &#151; Overview 

&#160; 

Our business encompasses two main elements: (1) the identification, analysis and acquisition of patents and patent rights; and (2) the generation of revenue from the acquired patents or patent rights. Typically, we compensate the patent holder with some combination of cash, equity, earn-out or debt in consideration for the patents or patent rights or resolution of claims. 

&#160; 

Key Factors of Our Business Model 

&#160; 

Diversification 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 327 U.S. and foreign patents and patent rights and 12 patent applications across a broad array of technologies, markets and countries. We intend to add more patents and patent applications to our portfolio for the purpose of generating additional revenues from assertion of claims against infringers. By owning multiple patent assets, we seek to continue to be diversified in both the types of patents that we own as well as the frequency and size of the monetization revenue generated by such patents. This diversification prevents us from having to rely on a single patent, or patent family, to generate our revenue. Additionally, by commencing multiple settlement and licensing campaigns with our different patent assets, we intend to generate frequent revenue events through the execution of multiple settlement and licensing agreements. Finally, we have commenced operations in Germany and France and are considering other venues as well, giving the Company diversification across different countries and increasing the damages footprint for our portfolios with counterparts in different countries. Our diversification of patent assets and revenue generation allows us to avoid the binary risk that can be associated with owning a single patent asset that typically generates a single stream of licensing revenue. 

&#160; 

Patent Acquisition Opportunities 

&#160; 

We have worked to establish a supply of patent acquisition opportunities with patent brokers and dealers, with individual inventors and patent owners, as well as with large corporations (including Fortune 500 corporations) who own patents. Service providers, such as patent prosecution and litigation attorneys and patent licensing professionals have also become key providers of patent opportunities. We maintain an important relationship with IP Navigation Group LLC (&#147;IP Nav&#148;) and have received a significant amount of our patent acquisition opportunities from our relationship with IP Nav. Affiliates of IP Nav maintain a significant ownership interest in our Company, as well as participate with us in revenue from various asset monetization efforts. We intend to continue to expand our relationships for patent acquisitions and expand the industries to which our patents apply. 

&#160; 

Patent Portfolio Evaluation 

&#160; 

We follow a disciplined due diligence approach when analyzing potential patent acquisitions. Each opportunity to acquire a patent can vary based on the amount and type of patent assets, the complexity of the underlying inventions and the analysis of the industries in which the invention is being used. Our portfolio evaluation involves an initial screening with our analytics platform, Opus Analytics, followed by internal technical analysis, third-party experts and damages assessment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In September 2014 we acquired a limited field of use exclusive license to use Opus Analytics from IP Nav. Opus Analytics is a proprietary patent analytics tool that we use extensively to review and analyze patent acquisition opportunities. 

&#160; 

We enter potential patent acquisition opportunities into Opus Analytics to evaluate patent decisions. The algorithm underlying Opus Analytics is comprised of approximately 120 factors, and it has been continuously updated using actual observations. After evaluation of the patents by Opus Analytics, the Company reviews subtleties in the language of a patent&#146;s recorded interactions with the patent office and evaluates prior art and literature. This evaluation can make significant differences in the potential monetization revenue derived from a patent or patent portfolio. We have developed proprietary processes and procedures for identifying problem areas and evaluating the strength of a patent portfolio before the decision is made to allocate resources to an acquisition or to launch an effective monetization effort, using the judgment and skill of our personnel. 

&#160; 

We often also seek to use third-party experts in the evaluation and due diligence of patent assets. The combination of our management team and third-party patent attorneys, intellectual property licensing experts and technology engineers allow us to conduct our tailored patent acquisition and evaluation processes and procedures. We evaluate both the types and strength of the claims of the patent as well as the file history of the patent. 

&#160; 

Finally, we identify potential infringers; industries within which the potential infringers exist; longevity of the patented technology; and a variety of other factors that directly impact the magnitude and potential success of a licensing and enforcement program. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

While there has previously been a noticeable proliferation of patent monetization firms seeking to enter the business, both public and private, there has been a visible decline over the last 6-12 months in the competition for purchasing patents. This has had the effect of reducing the purchase prices and making acquisitions less competitive, providing the Company with considerable opportunities for new acquisitions, both in the United States and internationally. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Currently, we define customers as those companies that procure licenses to our patents, to satisfy legal claims of infringement against commercial products or services they produce or sell. Our licensees generally obtain non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable license agreements in return for a single payment upon execution of the license agreement. However, in certain cases, such as the licenses for our Medtech portfolio, we may enter into licenses with recurring royalty payments that continue for a defined period of time. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Patent Rights 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of issued patents, patent applications and contract rights to patents. We began to generate revenue from patents during the second quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the median expiration date for patents in our portfolio is September 28, 2017 and the latest expiration date for a patent in our portfolio is March 29, 2029.
