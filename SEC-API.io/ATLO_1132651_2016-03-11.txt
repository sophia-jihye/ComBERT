 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Ames National Corporation (the "Company") is an Iowa corporation and bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company owns 100% of the stock of five banking subsidiaries consisting of two national banks and three state-chartered banks, as described below. All of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted in the State of Iowa and primarily within the central and north central Iowa counties of Boone, Hancock, Marshall, Polk and Story where the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are located. The Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of its banking subsidiaries and the management of its own investment and loan portfolios. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 405 5th Street, Ames, Iowa 50010. The Company&#8217;s telephone number is (515) 232-6251 and website address is www.amesnational.com. 

&#160; 

The Company was organized and incorporated on January 21, 1975 under the laws of the State of Iowa to serve as a holding company for its principal banking subsidiary, First National Bank, Ames, Iowa ("First National") located in Ames, Iowa. In 1983, the Company acquired the stock of the State Bank &#38; Trust Co. ("State Bank") located in Nevada, Iowa; in 1991, the Company, through a newly-chartered state bank known as Boone Bank &#38; Trust Co. ("Boone Bank"), acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the former Boone State Bank &#38; Trust Company located in Boone, Iowa; in 1995, the Company acquired the stock of the Reliance State Bank, (&#8221;Reliance Bank&#8221;) located in Story City, Iowa; and in 2002, the Company chartered and commenced operations of a new national banking organization, United Bank &#38; Trust NA (&#8220;United Bank&#8221;), located in Marshalltown, Iowa. First National, State Bank, Boone Bank, Reliance Bank and United Bank are each operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. These five financial institutions are referred to in this Form 10-K collectively as the &#8220;Banks&#8221; and individually as a &#8220;Bank&#8221;. 

&#160; 

The principal sources of Company revenue are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on fixed income investments held by the Company and the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans; and (vii) securities gains. The Company&#8217;s principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks&#8217; loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks&#8217; facilities; (v) professional fees; (vi) business development; (vii) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insurance assessments; and (viii) other real estate owned expenses. The largest component contributing to the Company&#8217;s net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management&#8217;s principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk. 

&#160; 

The Banks&#8217; lending activities consist primarily of short-term and medium-term commercial and agricultural real estate loans, residential real estate loans, agricultural and business operating loans and lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, personal loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans and origination of mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The Banks also offer a variety of demand, savings and time deposits, cash management services, merchant credit card processing, safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks and automated/video teller machine access. Four of the five Banks also offer trust services. 

&#160; 

The Company provides various services to the Banks which include, but are not limited to, management assistance, internal auditing services, human resources services and administration, compliance management, marketing assistance and coordination, loan review and support with respect to computer systems and related procedures.

Business Strategy and Operations 

&#160; 

As a multi-bank holding company for five community banks, the Company emphasizes strong personal relationships to provide products and services that meet the needs of the Banks&#8217; customers. The Company seeks to achieve growth and maintain a strong return on equity. To accomplish these goals, the Banks focus on small-to-medium size businesses that traditionally wish to develop an exclusive relationship with a single bank. The Banks, individually and collectively, have the size to give the personal attention required by business owners, in addition to the credit expertise to help businesses meet their goals. 

&#160; 

The Banks offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most financial institutions, including checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits of various types, ranging from money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. One major goal in developing the Banks&#39; product mix is to keep the product offerings as simple as possible, both in terms of the number of products and the features and benefits of the individual services. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to each Bank&#39;s principal market area at rates competitive in that Bank&#8217;s market. In addition, retirement accounts such as IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) are available. The FDIC insures all deposit accounts up to the maximum amount. The Banks solicit these accounts from small-to-medium sized businesses in their respective primary trade areas, and from individuals who live and/or work within these areas. No material portion of the Banks&#39; deposits has been obtained from a single person or from a few persons. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the loss of the deposits of any person or of a few persons would have an adverse effect on the Banks&#39; operations or erode their deposit base. 

&#160; 

Loans are provided to creditworthy borrowers regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, marital status, disability, receipt of public assistance or any other basis prohibited by law. The Banks intend to fulfill this commitment while maintaining prudent credit standards. In the course of fulfilling this obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities which they serve, the Banks give consideration to each credit application regardless of the fact that the applicant may reside in a low to moderate income neighborhood, and without regard to the geographic location of the residence, property or business within their market areas. 

&#160; 

The Banks provide innovative, quality financial products, such as Internet banking and trust services that meet the banking needs of their customers and communities. The loan programs and acceptance of certain loans may vary from time-to-time depending on the funds available and regulations governing the banking industry. The Banks offer all basic types of credit to their local communities and surrounding rural areas, including commercial, agricultural and consumer loans. The types of loans within these categories are as follows: 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans. Commercial loans are typically made to sole proprietors, partnerships, corporations and other business entities such as municipalities where the loan is to be used primarily for business purposes. These loans are typically secured by assets owned by the borrower and often times involve personal guarantees given by the owners of the business. Approximately 50% of the loan portfolio consists of loans made for commercial purposes. 

&#160; 

The types of loans the Banks offer include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

financing guaranteed under Small Business Administration programs 

&#160; &#9679; operating and working capital loans &#160; &#9679; 

loans to finance equipment and other capital purchases 

&#160; &#9679; 

commercial real estate loans 

&#160; &#9679; 

business lines of credit 

&#160; &#9679; 

term loans 

&#160; &#9679; 

loans to professionals 

&#160; &#9679; 

letters of credit 

&#160; 

Agricultural Loans. The Banks, by nature of their location in central and north-central Iowa, are directly and indirectly involved in agriculture and agri-business lending. This includes short-term seasonal lending associated with cyclical crop and livestock production, intermediate term lending for machinery, equipment and breeding stock acquisition and long-term real estate lending. These loans are typically secured by the crops, livestock, equipment or real estate being financed. The basic tenet of the Banks&#39; agricultural lending philosophy is a blending of strong, positive cash flow supported by an adequate collateral position, along with a demonstrated capacity to withstand short-term negative impact if necessary. Applicable governmental subsidies and affiliated programs are utilized if warranted to accomplish these parameters. Approximately 20% of the loan portfolio consists of loans made for agricultural purposes. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are typically available to finance home improvements and consumer purchases, such as automobiles, household furnishings and boats. These loans are made on both a secured and an unsecured basis. The following types of consumer loans are available: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

automobiles and trucks 

&#160; &#9679; 

boats and recreational vehicles 

&#160; &#9679; 

personal loans and lines of credit 

&#160; &#9679; 

home equity lines of credit 

&#160; &#9679; 

home improvement and rehabilitation loans 

&#160; &#9679; 

consumer real estate loans 

&#160; 

Other types of credit programs, such as loans to nonprofit organizations, to public entities, for community development and to other governmental programs also are available. 

&#160; 

First National, Boone Bank, State Bank and United Bank offer wealth management services typically found in a commercial bank with trust powers, including the administration of estates, conservatorships, personal and corporate trusts and agency accounts. The Banks also provide farm management, investment and custodial services for individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations. 

&#160; 

The Banks earn income from the origination of residential mortgages that are sold in the secondary real estate market without retaining the mortgage servicing rights. 

&#160; 

The Banks offer traditional banking services, such as safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, automated/video teller machine access and automatic drafts (ACH) for various accounts. 

&#160; 

Lending Credit Management 

&#160; 

The Company strives to achieve sound credit risk management. In order to achieve this goal, the Company has established uniform credit policies and underwriting criteria for the Banks&#8217; loan portfolios. The Banks diversify in the types of loans offered and are subject to regular credit examinations, annual internal and external loan audits and annual review of large loans, as well as quarterly reviews of loans experiencing deterioration in credit quality. The Company attempts to identify potential problem loans early, charge off loans promptly and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has established credit guidelines for the Banks&#8217; lending portfolios which include guidelines relating to the more commonly requested loan types, as follows: 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Loans - Commercial real estate loans, including agricultural real estate loans, are normally based on loan to appraisal value ratios of not to exceed 80% and secured by a first priority lien position. Loans are typically subject to interest rate adjustments no less frequently than 5 years from origination. Fully amortized monthly repayment terms normally do not exceed twenty years. Projections and cash flows that show ability to service debt within the amortization period are required. Property and casualty insurance is required to protect the Banks&#8217; collateral interests. Commercial and agricultural real estate loans represent approximately 44% of the loan portfolio. Major risk factors for commercial real estate loans, as well as the other loan types described below, include a geographic concentration in central Iowa; the dependence of the local economy upon several large governmental entities, including Iowa State University and the Iowa Department of Transportation; and the health of Iowa&#8217;s agricultural sector that is dependent on weather conditions and government programs. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Agricultural Operating Lines - These loans are made to businesses and farm operations with terms up to twelve months. The credit needs are generally seasonal with the source of repayment coming from the entity&#8217;s normal business cycle. Cash flow reviews are completed to establish the ability to service the debt within the terms of the loan. A first priority lien on the general assets of the business normally secures these types of loans. Loan-to-value limits vary and are dependent upon the nature and type of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Crop and hail insurance is required for most agricultural borrowers. Loans are generally guaranteed by the principal(s). 

&#160; 

Commercial and Agricultural Term Loans &#8211; These loans are made to businesses and farm operations to finance equipment, breeding stock and other capital expenditures. Terms are generally the lesser of five years or the useful life of the asset. Term loans are normally secured by the asset being financed and are often additionally secured with the general assets of the business. Loan to value is generally 75% of the cost or value of the assets. Loans are normally guaranteed by the principal(s). Commercial and agricultural operating and term loans represent approximately 26% of the loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Residential First Mortgage Loans &#8211; Proceeds of these loans are used to buy or refinance the purchase of residential real estate with the loan secured by a first lien on the real estate. Most of the residential mortgage loans originated by the Banks (including servicing rights) are sold in the secondary mortgage market due to the higher interest rate risk inherent in the 15 and 30 year fixed rate terms consumers prefer. Loans that are originated and not sold in the secondary market generally have fixed rates of up to fifteen years. The maximum amortization of first mortgage residential real estate loans is 30 years. The loan-to-value ratios normally do not exceed 90% without credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance. Property insurance is required on all loans to protect the Banks&#8217; collateral position. Loans secured by one to four family residential properties represent approximately 18% of the loan portfolio. 

&#160; &#160; 

Home Equity Term Loans &#8211; These loans are normally for the purpose of home improvement or other consumer purposes and are secured by a junior mortgage on residential real estate. Loan-to-value ratios normally do not exceed 90% of market value. 

&#160; 

Home Equity Lines of Credit - The Banks offer a home equity line of credit generally with a maximum term of 60 months. These loans are secured by a junior mortgage on the residential real estate and normally do not exceed a loan-to-market value ratio of 90% with the interest adjusted quarterly. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans &#8211; Consumer loans are normally made to consumers under the following guidelines. Automobiles - loans on new and used automobiles generally will not exceed 90% and 75% of the value, respectively. Recreational vehicles and boats will not exceed 90% and 66% of the value, respectively. Each of these loans is secured by a first priority lien on the assets and requires insurance to protect the Banks&#8217; collateral position. Unsecured - The term for unsecured loans generally does not exceed 12 months. Consumer and other loans represent approximately 3% of the loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Investments available-for-sale&#160; 

&#160; 

The investment policy of the Company generally is to invest funds among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the Company&#8217;s need for liquidity, to achieve the proper balance between its desire to minimize risk and maximize yield, and to fulfill the Company&#8217;s asset/liability management policies. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolios are managed in accordance with a written investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors. It is the Company&#8217;s general policy to purchase investment securities which are U.S. Government securities, U.S. government agency, state and local government obligations, corporate debt securities, other equity securities and overnight federal funds. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Banks had a total of 208 full-time equivalent employees and the Company had an additional 12 full-time employees. The Company and Banks provide their employees with a comprehensive program of benefits, including comprehensive medical, vision and dental plans, long-term and short-term disability coverage, and a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Management considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory. Unions represent none of the employees. 

&#160;

Loan services include primarily commercial and consumer types of credit including operating lines, equipment loans, automobile financing and real estate loans. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The geographic market area served by the Banks is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. The Banks compete principally with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance divisions of auto and farm equipment companies, agricultural suppliers and other financial service providers. Some of these competitors are local, while others are statewide or nationwide. The major commercial bank competitors include Great Western Bank, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, each of which maintains an office or offices within the Banks&#8217; primary central Iowa trade areas. Among the advantages such larger banks have are their ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to geographic regions of higher yield and demand. These larger banking organizations have much higher legal lending limits than the Banks and thus are better able to finance large regional, national and global commercial customers. 

&#160; 

In order to compete with the other financial institutions in their primary trade areas, the Banks use, to the fullest extent possible, the flexibility which is accorded by independent status. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity and personal contacts by the Banks&#39; officers, directors and employees. In particular, the Banks compete for deposits principally by offering depositors a wide variety of deposit programs, convenient office locations, hours and other services. The Banks compete for loans primarily by offering competitive interest rates, experienced local lending personnel and quality products and services. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, there were 47 FDIC insured institutions having approximately 112 locations within Boone, Hancock, Marshall, Polk and Story County, Iowa where the Banks&#39; offices are located. First National, State Bank and Reliance Bank together have the largest percentage of deposits in Story County. 

&#160; 

The Banks also compete with the financial markets for funds. Yields on corporate and government debt securities and commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Commercial banks also compete for funds with equity, money market, and insurance products offered by brokerage and insurance companies. This competitive trend will likely continue in the future. 

&#160; 

The Company anticipates bank competition will continue to change materially over the next several years as more financial institutions, including the major regional and national banks, continue to consolidate. Credit unions, which are not subject to income taxes, have a significant competitive advantage and provide additional competition in the Company&#8217;s local markets. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The following discussion refers to certain statutes and regulations affecting the banking industry in general. These references provide brief summaries and therefore do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to those statutes and regulations. In addition, due to the numerous statutes and regulations that apply to and regulate the banking industry, many are not referenced below. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;the Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) . In response to the last national and international economic recession and to strengthen supervision of financial institutions and systemically important nonbank financial institutions, Congress and the U.S. government have taken a variety of actions, including the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents the most comprehensive change to banking laws since the Great Depression of the 1930s and mandates changes in several key areas: regulation and compliance (both with respect to financial institutions and systemically important nonbank financial companies), securities regulation, executive compensation, regulation of derivatives, corporate governance, transactions with affiliates, deposit insurance assessments and consumer protection. While the changes in the law required by the Dodd-Frank Act has most significantly affected larger institutions, even relatively small institutions such as the Company have been affected. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Banks are subject to regulations promulgated by the consumer protection bureau housed within the Federal Reserve, known as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;Bureau&#8221; or &#8220;BCFP&#8221;). The Bureau promulgates rules and orders with respect to consumer financial products and services and has substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, such as the Banks. The Bureau will not, however, examine or supervise the Banks for compliance with such regulations; rather, enforcement authority will remain with the Banks&#8217; primary federal regulator although the Banks may be required to submit reports or other materials to the Bureau upon its request. 

&#160; 

The Company and the Banks are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Regulation and supervision of financial institutions is primarily intended to protect depositors and the FDIC rather than shareholders of the Company. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly over recent years. There is reason to expect that similar changes will continue in the future. Any change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the business, operations and prospects of the Company. The Company is unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on its business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new federal or state legislation may have in the future. 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

The Company is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership of the Banks, and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). The Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), which subjects the Company and the Banks to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under the BHCA, the Company files with the Federal Reserve annual reports of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength to the Banks. The Federal Reserve takes the position that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve&#39;s position that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, bank holding companies should use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity. It should also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for providing assistance to its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company&#39;s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, or a violation of the Federal Reserve&#39;s regulations, or both. 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve Approval. Bank holding companies must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they: (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting stock of any bank if, after such acquisition, they would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of such bank; (ii) merge or consolidate with another bank holding company; or (iii) acquire substantially all of the assets of any additional banks. 

&#160; 

Non-Banking Activities. With certain exceptions, the BHCA also prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting stock in any company other than a bank or a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve finds the company&#39;s business to be incidental to the business of banking. When making this determination, the Federal Reserve in part considers whether allowing a bank holding company to engage in those activities would offer advantages to the public that would outweigh possible adverse effects. A bank holding company may engage in permissible non-banking activities on a de novo basis, if the holding company meets certain criteria and notifies the Federal Reserve within ten (10) business days after the activity has commenced. 

&#160; 

Financial Holding Company. Under the Financial Services Modernization Act, eligible bank holding companies may elect (with the approval of the Federal Reserve) to become a "financial holding company." Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in certain financial activities through affiliates that had previously been prohibited activities for bank holding companies. Such financial activities include securities and insurance underwriting and merchant banking. At this time, the Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, but may choose to do so at some time in the future. 

&#160; 

Control Transactions. The Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, requires a person or group of persons acquiring "control" of a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with at least 60 days prior written notice of the proposed acquisition. Following receipt of this notice, the Federal Reserve has 60 days to issue a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, but the Federal Reserve may extend this time period for up to another 30 days. An acquisition may be completed before the disapproval period expires if the Federal Reserve issues written notice of its intent not to disapprove the action. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would constitute the acquisition of control. In addition, any "company" would be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (or 5% if the "company" is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding shares of the Company, or otherwise obtain control over the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Banks are deemed affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between affiliates are subject to certain restrictions. Generally, the Federal Reserve Act: (i) limits the extent to which the financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with an affiliate; and (ii) requires all transactions with an affiliate, whether or not "covered transactions," to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. 

&#160; 

State Law on Acquisitions. Iowa law permits bank holding companies to make acquisitions throughout the state. However, Iowa currently has a deposit concentration limit of 15% on the amount of deposits in the state that any one banking organization can control and continue to acquire banks or bank deposits (by acquisitions), which applies to all depository institutions doing business in Iowa. 

&#160; 

Banking Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Applicable federal and state statutes and regulations governing a bank&#39;s operations relate, among other matters, to capital adequacy requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, certain interest rates payable, mergers and consolidations, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and dealings with affiliated persons. 

&#160; 

First National and United Bank are national banks subject to primary federal regulation and supervision by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). The FDIC, as an insurer of the deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law, also has some limited regulatory authority over First National and United Bank. State Bank, Boone Bank and Reliance Bank are state banks subject to regulation and supervision by the Iowa Division of Banking. The three state Banks are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures their respective deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal laws that apply to the Banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans. The laws and regulations governing the Banks generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC and not to protect stockholders of such institutions or their holding companies. 

&#160; 

The OCC and FDIC each have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what it considers to be an unsafe and unsound practice in conducting their business. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires federal banking regulators to adopt regulations or guidelines in a number of areas to ensure bank safety and soundness, including internal controls, credit underwriting, asset growth, management compensation, ratios of classified assets to capital and earnings. FDICIA also contains provisions which are intended to change independent auditing requirements, restrict the activities of state-chartered insured banks, amend various consumer banking laws, limit the ability of "undercapitalized banks" to borrow from the Federal Reserve&#39;s discount window, require regulators to perform periodic on-site bank examinations and set standards for real estate lending. 

&#160; 

Borrowing Limitations. Each of the Banks is subject to limitations on the aggregate amount of loans that it can make to any one borrower, including related entities. Subject to numerous exceptions based on the type of loans and collateral, applicable statutes and regulations generally limit loans to one borrower of 15% of total equity and reserves. Each of the Banks is in compliance with applicable loans to one borrower requirements. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance . Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized up to $250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based insurance assessment system under which depository institutions contribute funds to the FDIC insurance fund based on their risk classification. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after an administrative hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC (collectively, the "Agencies") have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and account for off-balance sheet items. Failure to achieve and maintain adequate capital levels may give rise to supervisory action through the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels. Each of the Banks is in compliance with applicable risk-based capital level requirements as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Basel III Capital Requirements. &#160; In July, 2013, t he Agencies, approved final rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Banks, as compared to the prior U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#8217;s 1988 &#8220;Basel I&#8221; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal agencies&#8217; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company and Banks on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. 

&#160; 

Among other matters, the Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. &#160; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and Banks are subject to new regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Failure by the Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Banks were subject to capital requirements under Basel I and there were no capital requirements for the Company. Under the capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and Banks&#8217; assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company&#8217;s and Banks&#8217; capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. See Note 16 to the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#8221; which is included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items are not excluded; however, the Company and Banks, made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. This election was made concurrently with the first filing of certain of the Company and Banks&#8217; periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015 in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, from inclusion in Tier 1 capital, subject to grandfathering in the case of companies, such as us, that had less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. 

&#160; 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015, and will be phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016, at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

With respect to the Banks, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a large and risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in high-risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

&#160; 

Should the Company or Banks not meet the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and Banks would be subject to adverse regulatory action by their regulators, which action could result in material adverse consequences for the Company, Banks, and Company shareholders. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Banks exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements and were designated as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under federal guidelines. The table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity. See Note 16 to the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#8221; which is included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action. Regulations adopted by the Agencies impose even more stringent capital requirements under prompt corrective action. The FDIC and other Agencies must take certain "prompt corrective action" when a bank fails to meet capital requirements. The regulations establish and define five capital levels: (i) "well-capitalized," (ii) "adequately capitalized," (iii) "undercapitalized," (iv) "significantly undercapitalized" and (v) "critically undercapitalized." Increasingly severe restrictions are imposed on the payment of dividends and management fees, asset growth and other aspects of the operations of institutions that fall below the category of being "adequately capitalized." Undercapitalized institutions are required to develop and implement capital plans acceptable to the appropriate federal regulatory agency. Such plans must require that any company that controls the undercapitalized institution must provide certain guarantees that the institution will comply with the plan until it is adequately capitalized. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Banks was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions. 

&#160; 

Restrictions on Dividends. The dividends paid to the Company by the Banks are the major source of Company cash flow. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order. 

&#160; 

First National Bank and United Bank, as national banks, generally may pay dividends, without obtaining the express approval of the OCC, in an amount up to its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Boone Bank, Reliance Bank and State Bank are also restricted under Iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits. Additionally, the payment of dividends by the Banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and the Banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the Bank would be undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

Reserves Against Deposits 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. Generally, reserves of 3% must be maintained against total transaction accounts of $103,600,000 or less (subject to an exemption not in excess of the first $14,500,000 of transaction accounts). A reserve of $2,673,000 plus 10% of amounts in excess of $103,600,000 must be maintained in the event total transaction accounts exceed $103,600,000. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy applicable liquidity requirements. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the earning assets of the Banks. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulatory Enforcement Authority 

&#160; 

The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators are substantial and include, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, enforcement actions must be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions, or inactions, may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Applicable law also requires public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies. 

&#160; 

National Monetary Policies 

&#160; 

In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of the Banks are affected by the regulatory authorities&#8217; policies, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply, credit conditions and interest rates. Among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits and the Federal Reserve Discount Rate, which is the rate charged member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 

&#160; 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a material impact on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to have a similar impact in the future. Also important in terms of effect on banks are controls on interest rates paid by banks on deposits and types of deposits that may be offered by banks. The Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee, created by Congress in 1980, phased out ceilings on the rate of interest that may be paid on deposits by commercial banks and savings and loan associations, with the result that the differentials between the maximum rates banks and savings and loans can pay on deposit accounts have been eliminated. The effect of deregulation of deposit interest rates has been to increase banks&#39; cost of funds and to make banks more sensitive to fluctuation in market rates. 

&#160;
